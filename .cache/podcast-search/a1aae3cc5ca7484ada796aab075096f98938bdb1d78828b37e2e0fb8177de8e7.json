            "description": "Bob Mortimer is a comedian best known for his work with his comedy partner Vic Reeves.\nFor 30 years, he and Vic have appeared in numerous TV series together, including Vic Reeves’ Big Night Out, Shooting Stars and The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer. Bob first saw Vic performing in a south London pub: Vic was wearing a Bryan Ferry mask while trying to tap dance with wooden planks strapped to his feet. Bob found this hugely entertaining, and began to take part in Vic’s shows. \nBob was born in 1959 in Middlesbrough, the youngest of four boys. His father died in a car crash when he was seven and Bob says he became his mother’s little helper – although he also set fire to their house after playing with fireworks. As a teenager he dreamed of a career as a footballer, but he ended up studying law at university, and worked as a solicitor in south London. \nIn 2015 Bob underwent triple heart bypass surgery. After this – in a rare diversion from working with Vic – he accepted an invitation from fellow comedian Paul Whitehouse to get out of the house and go fishing, which led to a successful TV series, Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing.

            "description": "Adam talks with British comedian Bob Mortimer.Hi. Adam Buxton here with some notes about Bob and this episode.For nearly 30 years Bob and his comedy partner Jim Moir (aka Vic Reeves) have stuck doggedly to what makes them laugh whether mainstream audiences get it or not, with shows like ‘The Smell Of Reeves & Mortimer’, ‘Bang Bang It’s Reeves & Mortimer’, ‘Catterick’, and ‘House Of Fools’ as well as the occasional reboots of the massively popular panel show ‘Shooting Stars’ and the show that introduced them to the world in 1990, ‘Big Night Out’. Consistently and inexhaustibly joyful, energetic and absurd, their parade of characters, silly voices, home made props and a sensibility that is often close to avant garde performance art, has made them two of the best loved and most influential comedians the UK has ever produced. When not working with Jim, Bob enjoys watching football. He’s an avid supporter of Middlesbrough FC and is currently the co host along with comedy writer Andy Dawson of the vaguely football themed podcast, ‘Athletico Mince’. It’s up with the funniest stuff Bob’s ever done.My conversation with Bob, took place in the London office of his agent and for a while we had to battle with some quite loud talkers in the corridor outside doing agent business (I was too weedy to ask them to be quiet), but that calmed down after a little while and we rambled about getting older, the TV shows that Bob enjoys, his new fishing show with old friend and fellow comedian Paul Whitehouse, music, petty crime and now and then we looked back over a few Vic & Bob moments from the last 30 years. It was a fun conversation that often revealed a softer and more gentle side to Bob than people might expect. It’s a good bet that he would feel quite deeply nauseated by that last sentence and perhaps a few before too.Thanks to Séamus Murphy-Mitchell for production support and Matt Lamont for additional editing.

The guest has worked with Richard before, but has no memory of it at all, it's Middlesbrough's finest Bob Mortimer. There is some quite specific conversation about the roads in Linthorpe, speculation that Richard may have unknowingly played with a future rock star in his childhood, and the revelation of why Chris Rea was quiet when he was on Shooting Stars. Plus some fantastically and worryingly detailed conversations about terrorist atrocities and how to dispose of a body. Where would we be in a world with no lime?

            "description": "This week a bit of a diversion. MJ Price of Quite A Boast podcast - all things Reeves & Mortimer - joins Tyler to talk about his love of the Goons and considers what sort of influence or impact (or otherwise) they may have had on future comedians, specifically Vic Reeves & Bob Mortimer. Later the chat turns more generally towards R&M and their body of work, including Vic Reeves Big Night Out, Smell of Reeves & Mortimer, Bang Bang It's Reeves & Mortimer, Shooting Stars and Catterick (with dishonourable mentions to Randall & Hopkirk Deceased and that Ulrika special).They muse on how different generations of comics and comedians tended to flit into and out of each others' orbits and turn up in each others' shows and this is a tradition which applied equally to the Goons as it did to Reeves & Mortimer. It's a fun chat about a pair of comedy legends who crop up all too infrequently on Goon Pod but whose humour and inventiveness chimes with that of Milligan (although he would never have acknowledged that at the time!)You can find Quite A Boast here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL11Ba_QI4Z2_rczxZtu83mE7L4ZW6npL_&si=66WgrMaYtKOT0jEl\n",

They talk about holding dominion over the animals, whether questions are necessary in an interview, what prompted Bob to write his first novel and whether satsumas are the best small orange fruit, the adoration for Bob and Paul that the team behind Gone Fishing clearly have, why a double act of two nice men works, what it’s like being below average height, aspiring to watch TV, the treatment centre for phone addiction and how to take down coniferous trees. Also how many Bob Mortimers might there be out there and why his book imagines an alternate world for him?Bob has also brought along his joke book for emergencies.Buy Bob’s excellent book here - https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-The-Satsuma-Complex/dp/B0B5YBZP5JSUPPORT THE SHOW!Watch our TWITCH CHANNELBecome a badger and see extra content at our WEBSITE See details of the RHLSTP TOUR DATES Buy DVDs and books from GO FASTER STRIPE Hosted on Acast.

On this episode Meds and Kell chat away about two of their favourite comedians (and light entertainers) Vic and Bob. They hit our screens back in the late 80's and our two Wafflers were in sixth form at school at the time (and nothing seems to have changed in their childish minds) so it left a lasting impression. \nAlong with the main topic of chat the lads talk about the new Avatar film, some recent movie news and they read an email from our resident man in the asylum Rob K. \nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all. \n",

            "description": "Bob Mortimer is an English comedian, TV presenter, fisherman, author, podcaster, pork pie detective and 100% certified national treasure. He’s with us to chat about his new book, The Long Shoe, his third work of fiction following the successes of The Hotel Avocado and The Satsuma Complex. Bob has sold over 2 million books (and counting), crowning another significant chapter in his legendary career. \n\nBob first appeared on our screens in the early 90s in Vic Reeves’ Big Night Out. His working relationship with Vic has continued for decades and the pair are regarded among the funniest acts in British comedy. Bob is also known for his part in another double act, with Paul Whitehouse in Gone Fishing, a programme which documents their time together on the shores of rivers, streams, seas and lakes as part of Bob’s recovery from open heart surgery. \n\nUpon entering the Dish kitchen, Bob quickly spots the pork pie starter and crisp bowl, which is followed by Angela fulfilling his nostalgic request and serving kedgeree-style monkfish rice alongside a fresh and cold IPA. Waitrose’s wine experts pair this meal with a glass of Paul Mas Réserve Languedoc Blanc.\n\nFrom stories about accidental house fires to avoiding dinner parties and the perfect pasta name for a cat, we learn an incredible amount in Bob’s company. We also find time to put his love of eggs to the test in an action packed end of show finale. And remember: eat pie as often as you can! \n\nYou can watch full episodes of Dish on YouTube and, new for this season, on Spotify. \n\nAll recipes from this podcast can be found at waitrose.com/dishrecipes\n\nA transcript for this episode can be found at waitrose.com/dish\n\nIf you want to get in touch with us about anything at all, contact dish@waitrose.co.ukDish from Waitrose is made by Cold Glass Productions\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Richard is back and exhausted from fatherhood and trying to remember how these work and he’s smarting from Alan Sugar rejecting Herring’s proposed titles for the saggy-faced Lord’s autobiography. And there are a few changes and additions thanks to the successful video Kickstarter campaign. The guest has worked with Richard before, but has no memory of it at all, it’s Middlesbrough’s finest Bob Mortimer. There is some quite specific conversation about the roads in Linthorpe, speculation that Richard may have unknowingly played with a future rock star in his childhood, the revelation of why Chris Rea was quiet when he was on Shooting Stars. Plus some fantastically and worryingly detailed conversations about terrorist atrocities and how to dispose of a body.

I sometimes (unfairly) think badly of myself because of this. I enjoy reading autobiographies of people that I admire because I feel like I already know some of the context, so I find it an easier starting point than some other books. This is, of course, a very funny and silly book but he also writes very sensitively about his life, experiences, and being a shy and quiet person.\nHow did you record yourself? I recorded myself using my phone, sitting at my desk at home one afternoon whilst waiting for a colleague to proof read and approve something for me. Bob’s company took my mind off the fear of them finding a horrific, unfixable mistake (there wasn’t one… there never is!).\n",

The episode unnerved him, but forced him to reflect on his life so far. This is the framework for his hilarious and moving memoir, And Away… Although his childhood in Middlesbrough was normal on the surface, it was tinged by the loss of his dad, and his own various misadventures (now infamous from his appearances on Would I Lie to You?), from burning down the family home to starting a short-lived punk band called Dog Dirt. As an adult, he trained as a solicitor and moved to London. Though he was doing pretty well (the South London Press once crowned him ‘The Cockroach King’ after a successful verdict), a chance encounter in a pub in the 1980s with a young comedian going by the name Vic Reeves set his life on a different track. And now, six years on, the heart condition that once threatened his career has instead led to new success on BBC2’s Gone Fishing. Warm, profound, and irrepressibly funny, And Away… is Bob’s full life story (with a few lies thrown in for good measure.)\n\nContact: info@hotaudiobook.com",

Bob first saw Vic performing in a south London pub: Vic was wearing a Bryan Ferry mask while trying to tap dance with wooden planks strapped to his feet. Bob found this hugely entertaining, and began to take part in Vic’s shows. \nBob was born in 1959 in Middlesbrough, the youngest of four boys. His father died in a car crash when he was seven and Bob says he became his mother’s little helper – although he also set fire to their house after playing with fireworks. As a teenager he dreamed of a career as a footballer, but he ended up studying law at university, and worked as a solicitor in south London. \nIn 2015 Bob underwent triple heart bypass surgery. After this – in a rare diversion from working with Vic – he accepted an invitation from fellow comedian Paul Whitehouse to get out of the house and go fishing, which led to a successful TV series, Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing. \n\nBOOK CHOICE: My Secret History by Paul Theroux\nLUXURY ITEM: His own pillow\nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE: Down to You by Joni Mitchell\n\nPresenter: Lauren Laverne\nProducer: Sarah Taylor",

The Duellists was set. A fifth of the seats at the Royal Albert Hall are owned by just over 300 people - who can choose to enjoy performances or sell the tickets on at a profit.   We hear from Richard Lyttelton, a former President of the Royal Albert Hall who believes that making money out of the seats doesn't really align with the original vision of the venue. A Gloucester Old Spot pig has been named The Satsuma Complex - in honour of comedian Bob Mortimer's first book, which has won this year's Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize for the best comic novel.

Bob  Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse have been friends for 30 years, but when  life intervened, what was once a joyous and spontaneous friendship  dwindled to the odd phone call or occasional catch up. Then, Glory Be!  They were both diagnosed with heart disease and realised that time is  short. They'd better spend it fishing . . . So they dusted off  their kits, chucked on their waders and ventured into the achingly  beautiful British countryside to fish, rediscover the joys of their  friendship and ruminate on some of life's most profound questions, such  as: How did we get so old? Where are all the fish? What are your  favourite pocket meats? What should we do if we find a corpse? Following the success of the BBC's Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing  series, this wonderful audiobook by two lifelong friends is a love  letter to the joys of angling, the thrill of the catch and the virtue of  having a right daft laff with your mates. On the fish, the equipment,  the food, and the locations, Gone Fishing is the perfect  audiobook for fans of Bob Mortimer, Paul Whitehouse and for anyone who  wants to listen to a brilliantly written and endlessly funny joint  memoir on life, friendship and joys of fishing. AUDIO EDITION INCLUDES AN EXCLUSIVE FISHING TRIP WITH BOB AND PAUL.",

            "description": "Episode Notes\nWe discuss Bob Mortimer's autobiography And Away... as read by Bob Mortimer.\nBob Mortimer’s life was trundling along happily until suddenly in 2015 he was diagnosed with a heart condition that required immediate surgery and forced him to cancel an upcoming tour. The episode unnerved him, but forced him to reflect on his life so far. This is the framework for his hilarious and moving memoir, And Away… Although his childhood in Middlesbrough was normal on the surface, it was tinged by the loss of his dad, and his own various misadventures (now infamous from his appearances on Would I Lie to You?), from burning down the family home to starting a short-lived punk band called Dog Dirt. As an adult, he trained as a solicitor and moved to London. Though he was doing pretty well (the South London Press once crowned him ‘The Cockroach King’ after a successful verdict), a chance encounter in a pub in the 1980s with a young comedian going by the name Vic Reeves set his life on a different track. And now, six years on, the heart condition that once threatened his career has instead led to new success on BBC2’s Gone Fishing. Warm, profound, and irrepressibly funny, And Away… is Bob’s full life story (with a few lies thrown in for good measure.)  \nThanks for listening.
