        "description": "I loved interviewing Richard Osman and can’t stop thinking about our conversation. I think it’s because his brain works at warp speed: I genuinely felt he was three steps ahead of every question I was about to ask. It became something of a personal challenge to ask a question he couldn’t guess beforehand and I *think* I managed it when I asked if he’d ever written to Jim’ll Fix It (he had, by the way).\n\nHis mind was formed by an early passion for television and the stories it created. He became an expert producer of winning formats and then, in his 40s, transferred his skill for knowing what people wanted to books. His debut, The Thursday Murder Club, became the fastest-selling crime novel of all time. The following three in the same series have sold over 10 million copies globally.\n\nHe joins me to talk about professional failure, his lifelong struggle with food addiction and his Fear Of Joining In (FOJI). Plus: cats and why being tall is a successful c**t radar.\n\nRichard’s new novel - We Solve Murders is published on 12 September 2024.\n\nAs always, I’d LOVE to hear about your failures. Every week, my guest and I choose a selection to read out and answer on our special subscription offering, Failing with Friends. We’ll endeavour to give you advice, wisdom, some laughs and much, much more.\n\n\n\nHave something to share of your own? I'd love to hear from you!

        "description": "Richard Osman is a broadcaster, TV producer and writer who co-presents the quiz show Pointless on BBC One. His first novel, The Thursday Murder Club, was a publishing phenomenon, selling more than a million copies, and the follow-up became one of the fastest-selling titles since records began.\nRichard grew up in Haywards Heath in West Sussex and his early passion for television led to him devising quiz shows and programme formats from a young age. After graduating from university he worked for a number of production companies where he helped to develop and produce shows including Total Wipeout, Deal or No Deal and 8 out of 10 Cats.  \nIn 2009 Richard became a co-presenter of Pointless alongside Alexander Armstrong. It was not his intention to move in front of the camera, but he was given the job after taking on the role of co-host while the show was being developed. \nIn 2020 Richard published his debut novel, the Thursday Murder Club, the story of four friends in a retirement community who band together to solve cold cases. It was an instant hit, selling 45,000 copies in its first three days on sale.  Steven Spielberg has bought the film rights. \nRichard lives in London and is writing his third novel featuring his resourceful retirees. \nDISC ONE: Bring Me Sunshine by Morecambe And Wise\nDISC TWO: Metal Mickey by Suede\nDISC THREE: Snooker (Drag Racer) by The Douglas Wood Group\nDISC FOUR:  You Can't Stop The Beat by the cast of Hairspray (Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, Amanda Bynes, Elijah Kelly, John Travolta and Queen Latifah)\nDISC FIVE: Extraordinary Machine by Fiona Apple\nDISC SIX: American Boy by Estelle Featuring Kanye West\nDISC SEVEN: Ran by Future Islands\nDISC EIGHT: A Little Respect by Erasure\nBOOK CHOICE:  Hercule Poirot: the Complete Short Stories by Agatha Christie\nLUXURY ITEM: A pad of paper, a pen and dice\nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE: DISC FOUR:  You Can't Stop The Beat by the cast of Hairspray \nPresenter Lauren Laverne\nProducer  Paula McGinley",

        "description": "Are the couple behind the phenomenally successful 'The Salt Path' lying in their incredible memoir? How has an AI band duped music fans around the world? What is the secret sauce to the Youtube sensation Hot Ones?\n\n\n\nThe Salt Path rocked the world in 2018 when couple Raynor and Moth Winn told their real-life tale overcoming terminal illness and homelessness by taking a 630 mile walk around the UK. Now an incredible article in the Observer claims that the main elements of Raynor and Moth Winn’s story, including their names, are fabrications. What is the truth and what do publishers or film studios do in cases like this?\n\n\n\nThe Velvet Sundown are racking up millions of listeners on Spotify, despite having never existed. Does it matter that our streaming services are flooded with AI slop - and can Richard and Marina have a number one hit using the same software? \n\n\n\nHot Ones, it's the show with hot sauces and even hotter IP. The Sean Evans fronted YouTube show has sold the format to a German comedian - but what is the secret behind this success?\n\n\n\nRecommendations: \n\nRichard - Death Valley (iPlayer)\n\n\n\nThe Rest Is Entertainment AAA Club: Become a member for exclusive bonus content, early access to our Q&A episodes, ad-free listening, access to our exclusive newsletter archive, discount book prices on selected titles with our partners at Coles, early ticket access to future live events, and our members’ chatroom on Discord. \n\n\n\nJust head to therestisentertainment.com to sign up, or start a free trial today on Apple Podcasts: apple.co/therestisentertainment.\n\n\n\nThe Rest Is Entertainment is proudly presented by Sky.

What makes Adam Sandler the most bankable actor in the world today?\n\nAfter South Park’s Trey Parker and Matt Stone signed a $1.5bn deal with Paramount, they kicked off their 27th season by taking aim at Donald Trump and Paramount themselves.\n\nTrump didn’t react well with the White House claiming the “show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years” yet could the show now be more relevant that ever? It targets the right, the left and the centre. It gets people talking. It is also worth in the eyes of Paramount that staggering sum of money. So, is South Park the most important show in the world right now?\n\n‘Grow a Garden’ is storming Roblox - the online universe where anyone can create games - beating records held by the likes of Fortnight in the process. But what is it, and is the secret of its success its simplicity?\n\nWith Happy Gilmore 2 streaming on Netflix now, Richard and Marina discuss if Adam Sandler is Hollywood’s biggest banker and why people underestimate his talent and appeal. \n\nRecommendations:Marina: Diana World - Edward WhiteRichard: The Map Men (YouTube)\n\nThe Rest Is Entertainment AAA Club: Become a member for exclusive bonus content, early access to our Q&A episodes, ad-free listening, access to our exclusive newsletter archive, discount book prices on selected titles with our partners at Coles, early ticket access to future live events, and our members’ chatroom on Discord. \n\nJust head to therestisentertainment.com to sign up, or start a free trial today on Apple Podcasts: apple.co/therestisentertainment.\n\nThe Rest Is Entertainment is proudly presented by Sky.
