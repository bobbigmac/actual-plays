He will never tell. He’s also slightly taken aback by his son’s Christmas list. His guest is sarcastic TV host and best selling author and now effing podcaster, Richard Osman. Herring pitches some gameshow ideas to an unimpressed Osman and attempts to solve the Richard Osman urinal conundrum. They also chat about the strange questions that you get asked at European book events, playing the Royal Albert Hall, whether Osman will still be writing the Thursday Murder Club when he’s in an old folks home, how Herring missed out on the ultimate prize on House of Games. Plus a new Spiderman based emergency question is given short shrift and would you like to live to 150 or more.See RHLSTP live http://richardherring.com/rhlstpSUPPORT THE SHOW!See details of the RHLSTP LIVE DATES Watch our TWITCH CHANNELBecome a badger and see extra content at our WEBSITE Buy DVDs and books from GO FASTER STRIPE Hosted on Acast.

Richard talks to Gyles about his early years - how his happy childhood spent holidaying with families from the street was disrupted by his father leaving the family when Richard was only nine. He talks about his struggles with his eyesight, and how that and his height made him feel separate, and different. He talks about his amazing mum, and how she coped as a single parent. Richard talks about how much he loves TV, and about how much he loves his wife, Ingrid Oliver. And he tells Gyles about seeking help for his food addiction.

There is some discussion of who from Lee and Herring has had the more successful career (no spoilers) and whether there is any danger of a Slattery style breakdown from doing too many episodes of Pointless, whether House of Games will ever offer psychological training, how to get into the dying medium of TV and what is an appropriate height differential for lovers..

His first novel, The Thursday Murder Club, was a publishing phenomenon, selling more than a million copies, and the follow-up became one of the fastest-selling titles since records began.Richard grew up in Haywards Heath in West Sussex and his early passion for television led to him devising quiz shows and programme formats from a young age. After graduating from university he worked for a number of production companies where he helped to develop and produce shows including Total Wipeout, Deal or No Deal and 8 out of 10 Cats.  In 2009 Richard became a co-presenter of Pointless alongside Alexander Armstrong. It was not his intention to move in front of the camera, but he was given the job after taking on the role of co-host while the show was being developed. In 2020 Richard published his debut novel, the Thursday Murder Club, the story of four friends in a retirement community who band together to solve cold cases. It was an instant hit, selling 45,000 copies in its first three days on sale.  Steven Spielberg has bought the film rights. Richard lives in London and is writing his third novel featuring his resourceful retirees.
