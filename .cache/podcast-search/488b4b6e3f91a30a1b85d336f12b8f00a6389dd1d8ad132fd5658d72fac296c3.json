        "description": "Bob Mortimer is an English comedian, TV presenter, fisherman, author, podcaster, pork pie detective and 100% certified national treasure. He’s with us to chat about his new book, The Long Shoe, his third work of fiction following the successes of The Hotel Avocado and The Satsuma Complex. Bob has sold over 2 million books (and counting), crowning another significant chapter in his legendary career. \n\nBob first appeared on our screens in the early 90s in Vic Reeves’ Big Night Out. His working relationship with Vic has continued for decades and the pair are regarded among the funniest acts in British comedy. Bob is also known for his part in another double act, with Paul Whitehouse in Gone Fishing, a programme which documents their time together on the shores of rivers, streams, seas and lakes as part of Bob’s recovery from open heart surgery. \n\nUpon entering the Dish kitchen, Bob quickly spots the pork pie starter and crisp bowl, which is followed by Angela fulfilling his nostalgic request and serving kedgeree-style monkfish rice alongside a fresh and cold IPA. Waitrose’s wine experts pair this meal with a glass of Paul Mas Réserve Languedoc Blanc.\n\nFrom stories about accidental house fires to avoiding dinner parties and the perfect pasta name for a cat, we learn an incredible amount in Bob’s company. We also find time to put his love of eggs to the test in an action packed end of show finale. And remember: eat pie as often as you can! \n\nYou can watch full episodes of Dish on YouTube and, new for this season, on Spotify. \n\nAll recipes from this podcast can be found at waitrose.com/dishrecipes\n\nA transcript for this episode can be found at waitrose.com/dish\n\nIf you want to get in touch with us about anything at all, contact dish@waitrose.co.ukDish from Waitrose is made by Cold Glass Productions\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "description": "#505 Cheeky Underground Presence - Richard is back to work after the Christmas break (we’re coming to you from the past) and is worried about the door of depravity that he has opened up, but there is no need to fear because his guest is processed meat advocate, Bob Mortimer. It’s a free-wheeling chat as you might be prepared for that takes in farmers, meeting Paul McCartney, whether double acts are still talking to each other or not, a cursed earring, favourite openings and oh, just listen to it. It’s ace. And of course there’s some more jokes from Bob’s little black book.\nSee Rich's stand-up tour Can I Have My Ball Back - https://richardherring.com/ballback/\nSUPPORT THE SHOW!\nWatch our TWITCH CHANNEL\nSee extra content at our WEBSITE\n Hosted on Acast.

        "description": "Adam talks with British comedian Bob Mortimer.\nHi. Adam Buxton here with some notes about Bob and this episode.\nFor nearly 30 years Bob and his comedy partner Jim Moir (aka Vic Reeves) have stuck doggedly to what makes them laugh whether mainstream audiences get it or not, with shows like ‘The Smell Of Reeves & Mortimer’, ‘Bang Bang It’s Reeves & Mortimer’, ‘Catterick’, and ‘House Of Fools’ as well as the occasional reboots of the massively popular panel show ‘Shooting Stars’ and the show that introduced them to the world in 1990, ‘Big Night Out’. \nConsistently and inexhaustibly joyful, energetic and absurd, their parade of characters, silly voices, home made props and a sensibility that is often close to avant garde performance art, has made them two of the best loved and most influential comedians the UK has ever produced. \nWhen not working with Jim, Bob enjoys watching football. He’s an avid supporter of Middlesbrough FC and is currently the co host along with comedy writer Andy Dawson of the vaguely football themed podcast, ‘Athletico Mince’. It’s up with the funniest stuff Bob’s ever done.\nMy conversation with Bob, took place in the London office of his agent and for a while we had to battle with some quite loud talkers in the corridor outside doing agent business (I was too weedy to ask them to be quiet), but that calmed down after a little while and we rambled about getting older, the TV shows that Bob enjoys, his new fishing show with old friend and fellow comedian Paul Whitehouse, music, petty crime and now and then we looked back over a few Vic & Bob moments from the last 30 years. \nIt was a fun conversation that often revealed a softer and more gentle side to Bob than people might expect. It’s a good bet that he would feel quite deeply nauseated by that last sentence and perhaps a few before too.\nThanks to Séamus Murphy-Mitchell for production support and Matt Lamont for additional editing.

        "description": "Bob Mortimer is a comedian best known for his work with his comedy partner Vic Reeves.\nFor 30 years, he and Vic have appeared in numerous TV series together, including Vic Reeves’ Big Night Out, Shooting Stars and The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer. Bob first saw Vic performing in a south London pub: Vic was wearing a Bryan Ferry mask while trying to tap dance with wooden planks strapped to his feet. Bob found this hugely entertaining, and began to take part in Vic’s shows. \nBob was born in 1959 in Middlesbrough, the youngest of four boys. His father died in a car crash when he was seven and Bob says he became his mother’s little helper – although he also set fire to their house after playing with fireworks. As a teenager he dreamed of a career as a footballer, but he ended up studying law at university, and worked as a solicitor in south London. \nIn 2015 Bob underwent triple heart bypass surgery. After this – in a rare diversion from working with Vic – he accepted an invitation from fellow comedian Paul Whitehouse to get out of the house and go fishing, which led to a successful TV series, Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing. \nBOOK CHOICE: My Secret History by Paul Theroux\nLUXURY ITEM: His own pillow\nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE: Down to You by Joni Mitchell\nPresenter: Lauren Laverne\nProducer: Sarah Taylor",

On this episode Meds and Kell chat away about two of their favourite comedians (and light entertainers) Vic and Bob. They hit our screens back in the late 80's and our two Wafflers were in sixth form at school at the time (and nothing seems to have changed in their childish minds) so it left a lasting impression. \n\nAlong with the main topic of chat the lads talk about the new Avatar film, some recent movie news and they read an email from our resident man in the asylum Rob K. \n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all. ",

Richard is back and exhausted from fatherhood and trying to remember how these work and he’s smarting from Alan Sugar rejecting Herring’s proposed titles for the saggy-faced Lord’s autobiography. And there are a few changes and additions thanks to the successful video Kickstarter campaign. The guest has worked with Richard before, but has no memory of it at all, it’s Middlesbrough’s finest Bob Mortimer. There is some quite specific conversation about the roads in Linthorpe, speculation that Richard may have unknowingly played with a future rock star in his childhood, the revelation of why Chris Rea was quiet when he was on Shooting Stars. Plus some fantastically and worryingly detailed conversations about terrorist atrocities and how to dispose of a body.

Then, the podteam take a look at the week's movie news and, in a bumper reviews section, cast their eyes over Edgar Wright's The Running Man, Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein, Ruben Fleischer's Now You See Me: Now You Don't, Julia Ducournau's Alpha, Gurinder Chadha's Christmas Karma, and James Vanderbilt's Nuremberg. Three of those movies provide this week's guests, as Edgar Wright drops by the podbooth to natter with Chris about The Running Man, and meeting Stephen King; [21:43 - 33:05 approx] Now You Three Me's Isla Fisher and Rosamund Pike talk magic and manky accents, again with Chris; [56:16 - 1:09:05 approx] and Michael Shannon talks Nuremberg and (mostly) R.E.M., also with Chris. [1:42:53 - 1:55:38 approx] Oh, and there's a huge revelation about the pod itself lurking within there somewhere. Forget what you think you know... and enjoy.",
