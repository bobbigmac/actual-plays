Towards the Northwest in the world of Iridiana is the country of Tellus, a Kingdom more connected to the land and the earth than the rest. The King and his Wives work towards peace and rebuilding the lands, which are scarred by random wild magic surges from the ancient long forgotten gods during the divine wars as well as the past devastation from the dragons. Nine days south of the capital is a lake known as the Obsidian Basin, we find a homely caravan of large carts and wagons where we meet the last of our players.

      "description": "Congratulations Abon and Ging! And to celebrate we bring you an episode of Uncle Shainsaw's Tableshop Workshop. This time we play... LAZERS and FEELINGZ. With special guest stars Joe from Nerd Asylum and Micah from Chasmquest! Early in the distant year of 2018 Scott Shainsaw had an idea to con his friends into playing more TTRPG's with him, thus Uncle Shainsaw's Tabletop Workshop was born. Ostensibly, it was a podcast dedicated to playing as many different TTRPG's as possible, stealing the best parts of them, and eventually building a new game of our own. In reality, it was of course just an excuse for Scott Shainsaw to play more games with his friends. We at Lawful Stupid are a D&D 5e actual play podcast who actually love to play. We love everything about the Tabletop RPG Community and consistently strive to make the world a better place within that community through inclusivity, creativity, charitable acts, and above all else, fantastical heroism.

      "description": "Happy Haloween! And what way better than to celebrate with your Lawful Stupid crew? Time for some Halloween fun with the Final Girl! Table Top! Early in the distant year of 2018 Scott Shainsaw had an idea to con his friends into playing more TTRPG's with him, thus Uncle Shainsaw's Tabletop Workshop was born. Ostensibly, it was a podcast dedicated to playing as many different TTRPG's as possible, stealing the best parts of them, and eventually building a new game of our own. In reality, it was of course just an excuse for Scott Shainsaw to play more games with his friends. We at Lawful Stupid are a D&D 5e actual play podcast who actually love to play. We love everything about the Tabletop RPG Community and consistently strive to make the world a better place within that community through inclusivity, creativity, charitable acts, and above all else, fantastical heroism.

      "description": "While we are on a short break following last week's climactic season finale, that doesn't mean that content stops rolling out on the Lawful Stupod train. Early in the distant year of 2018 Scott Shainsaw had an idea to con his friends into playing more TTRPG's with him, thus Uncle Shainsaw's Tabletop Workshop was born. Ostensibly, it was a podcast dedicated to playing as many different TTRPG's as possible, stealing the best parts of them, and eventually building a new game of our own. In reality, it was of course just an excuse for Scott Shainsaw to play more games with his friends. For your listening pleasure here is the bois take on Monster of the Week, and the first ever Uncle Shainsaw's Tabletop Workshop, Admin Notes: 1. This is from the early days of Lawful Stupid before we had improved our editing software, recording techniques, or recording equipment. This is also Scott Shainsaw's first ever attempt at editing audio content. For these reasons, an audio quality warning is warranted, but it's still not as bad as Castle Capel. 2. There is a break in this episode during which Dewayne believes his home may being invaded. I have left it in, because it was thrilling, and terrifying which a good monster podcast should be anyway. However, trigger warning all the same. 3. This fictional story is anchored in truth. The setting and some of the characters are based on Scott Shainsaw's real life family, friends, and acquaintences. Some events actually happened, some are made up for goofs. You decide which, but seriously above all else...DO NOT EMAIL MY MOM, SERIOUSLY GUYS, SHE WILL BE UPSET WITH ME! We at Lawful Stupid are a D&D 5e actual play podcast who actually love to play. We love everything about the Tabletop RPG Community and consistently strive to make the world a better place within that community through inclusivity, creativity, charitable acts, and above all else, fantastical heroism.
