We answer as many questions about the show as we possibly can, tie up some loose narrative threads, choose some overall favorite things, and talk about the future of the show and where we’re headed with this bard-tastic blast of a bardcast. And of course there’s a song at the end to cap everything off! Thank y’all so much for going on this journey with us and supporting us throughout it all. It means the world to us and we have loved being your bards throughout it all, and we can’t wait for the next adventure! At some point in the early summer, we'll be releasing Chaos Sauce Volume 9 and OST Volume 9, and we'll drop in the feed to talk more about that (and probably some other stuff), so definitely stay tuned for that.

We at bomBARDed stand with Black Lives Matter, and we encourage everyone to find ways to help in the movement that’s happening across our nation. There are many fantastic Black creators in our sphere of both Tabletop gaming and music, and we highly encourage you to seek them out and show them support in whatever way that you can. You can also show your support by donating to some of the organizations [below], and as we said on social media this past weekend, all of our sales on all of our music platforms in the month of June are going to be donated to the North Star Health Collective. We're also going to be matching the sales we had in May and donating those to them as well. However you choose to show your support, please take care of yourselves, take care of others, and stay strong. Talk to y’all next week.

We had an amazing time playing & we hope you enjoy our adventure! Yashee & Raz'ul's Birthday Fun Run benefitting The Texas Music Project is still going on, and you can still sign up if you'd like! Regarding everything that's currently going on in the world right now, here is something from @runningtogetherhub that we think sums it up pretty well: \"Having a virtual 5k will allow folks to still participate in ways they feel are safe and responsible for their own health and the wellbeing of those at risk. If you do not think it is okay to leave your home, it is okay to be creative! Walk 5 or 50 times around your house, run Link from Zoras Domain to Gerudo Town, or put together a 5000 piece puzzle. The goal is NOT to run or walk, but to do something as a community to raise funds for @texasmusicproject We certainly encourage everyone to continue making safe and healthy choices\" So as long as everyone continues being safe, and it's all good! Episode 52 will be out on April 7, and is going to be our first-ever, remotely-recorded episode while we practice our social distancing! Please everyone stay safe out (or rather IN) there, and hang tough through all of this. We love you and thanks for joining us as always! Love, The Bards",

Also, we are going to be pulling the bardlib episodes that we did from the podcast stream, but the individual songs and whole episodes will be available on our bandcamp page if you'd like to listen to/download them. In addition to the bardlibs, we also put up the choral \"Oh Yea\" that Spurrier plays when a Natural Twent is rolled, as well as the two Natural Twent songs that Goodrich played those two times for Kyle. Those are available in our BomBARDed Bits album on our bandcamp page. We're also going to keep doing giveaways during months when we release three episodes instead of the regular two (Read: any month with a 5th Tuesday in it), so keep an ear out for those as well! bomBARDed website: http://bombardedcast.com bombBARDed bandcamp: http://bombarded.bandcamp.com",

      "description": "IMPORTANT UPDATE - on the way to record Episode 20 with us, Spurrier was involved in a car accident. Thankfully he and everyone who was in the wreck are ok, but Spurrier did fracture his clavicle (collarbone) as a result of all the craziness. He's resting and recovering at home for the time being, and we wanted to let everyone know that he is going to be alright, but that Episode 20 will be a little late. In this announcement-type episode we've made though, we do a SONG OF REST for Spurrier in order to hopefully speed up his healing, so give it a listen! We do have some good news to go along with the not-so-good news. Our website is finally finshed and ready for action! bombardedcast.com has info about the show, merch, and a whole lot of other goodies waiting for ya, so check it out! We also do a Mad Libs and perform it as Yashee, Raz'ul, and Splash. It wound up being pretty fun! Anyways, thanks for your patience and if you'd like to send Spurrier a message on the ol social media, you can reach him at @basser26 on Twitter. *EDIT* (July 30, 2018) The bardlibs that we did over the past few weeks are now on our bandcamp page ( http://bombarded.bandcamp.com ) instead of in the feed so that the story won't be broken up so much. You can listen to AND download both the individual songs from the episodes as well as the full episodes there, so feel free to check them out if you're itching for those good ol bardlibs! LAST THING - if you want to join the bomBARDed discord, hit up @manamogen on Twitter and she'll hook you up! Thanks everyone!",

Also, it's a bit crazy this time of year for all of us, and we wanted to make sure we had enough time to dive back in properly. We hope you enjoy taking a moment to reflect, jam, and recap with us, and THANK YOU so much for all of the support you've given us as we've embarked on this musical journey. We truly appreciate it and love you all dearly. The next episode will be out on January 9th, 2018. See you then!",
