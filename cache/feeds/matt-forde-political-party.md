She began her career as a paediatrician, a career path that culminated in her publishing the Cass Review into Gender Identity Services. This is a thoughtful and empathetic analysis of the experiences of vulnerable young people. Hilary takes us inside the report and her findings. She also makes a compelling case for banning social media for under 16s... and tells us what it's like being a newbie in the Upper Chamber.

      "description": "George became a national political sensation in 2025 when he became the leader of Warwickshire County Council at the age of 18. The Reform councillor is now 19 and shares his experience of leadership. This is a fascinating insight into Reform as a party, to the realignment on the right and about the impact of defections like Robert Jenrick's. But it's also about the values that underpin George's thinking and about how you get things done in politics. Who is really in charge? And who should be?

What was going through his mind at that press conference the morning after the Brexit referendum? How did Boris react when he changed his mind about backing him? How did he end up throwing shapes in an Aberdeen nightclub? Michael also gives his take on Reform and Nigel Farage. How worried should we be about him becoming Prime Minister?

But how did he retain his seat throughout Labour's darkest years when colleagues around him were losing theirs? One of the most likeable MPs in the Commons was a Shadow Minister but didn't get appointed to the frontbench after the election. He talks openly and honestly about the mixed feelings he has about Labour finally forming a government, but not being a minister in it.

      "description": "Shama Tatler Shama was the Labour candidate in Chingford and Woodford Green and almost unseated Iain Duncan Smith just a few weeks ago. Had it not been for an independent candidate standing in the seat, Shama would almost certainly have won. Shama describes her experience in full, including the abuse she faced and the misinformation spread about her. In an election when many candidates had to suffer a similar fate, Shama's story is a vital testimony of how abusive modern politics has become.

Totally honest about why she'd never want to be an MP again, what working at GB News is really like and why she's dedicated to Labour even when the party hasn't valued her.

She's a member of the Joint Committee on National Security and she takes us inside the work of the committee, especially exploring our relationship with China.

A Labour MP since 1 May 1997 and a passionate Blairite, she stayed in the party during its darkest period and is now hopeful of a Labour victory at the next election. This is about more than politics. It's about life and what it's about. Siobhain's sister, Margaret, was the General Secretary of the party during its most successful period and is revered across politics. She sadly passed away last year. As well as raising awareness about brain cancer, Siobhain is also raising money for the UCLH Charity.

Among the many roles he's had, he worked for Gordon Brown in the run-up to 2010, became a Labour MP, served in the Shadow Cabinet and is now CEO of the Betting and Gaming Council. He shares hilarious stories from his amazing career in this entertaining interview. (He's also a Forest fan but that's not the reason he's on, it is purely on merit).

Born and raised in Birmingham, he has fascinating insights into class and the effects of it in the media and politics. He's hilarious, engaging and brilliant company. He loves politics so much. This is the best way to start Labour Conference week. Just a little warning , I do mention at the start of the episode why there's not been a show for a while and why the live editions aren't happening at the moment. I've got a tumour on my spine which I'm having removed, so I won't be working for a bit. I'm going to record some extra episodes of the show to cover the time before I return and maybe replay some of my favourite interviews from the back catalogue. I'll come back and I'll be fine, the shows will return at The Duchess Theatre and my tour will happen next year. Cheers! Buy Lewis's brilliant book ' Left for Dead?

      "description": "Kate Forbes' leadership campaign caused a stir earlier in the year, when she provided a different vision of what the SNP could be. In this candid and entertaining hour, Kate reflects on that campaign and what it all means. She talks openly about her faith and how to engage with people you disagree with. Why hasn't the SNP been able to convince a majority in favour of independence? Are the Scottish Greens good coalition partners? How will Labour do in Scotland next time? As well as discussing the weight of religious opinion and whether it should take precedence over other views, Kate also discusses far bigger issues such as what her favourite chocolate bar is, what her favourite cheese is and what her favourite wine is. Pour yourself a glass of red and enjoy.

From the news of Nicola Sturgeon's arrest, to his first awkward chat with Rishi Sunak, he shares the privileges and pressures of being First Minister. Humza talks openly about his mental health, but also his physical health where he's enlisted the help of Joe Wicks to shed his 'dad bod'. It's a real mix, with deep conversations about race, class and toxic masculinity, alongside a very honest assessment of his own footballing ability and love of Celtic. Warning: includes a wasp.

      "description": "Mhairi Black took British politics by storm with her election and maiden speech in 2015. 8 years on and she's now Deputy Leader of the SNP in Westminster... but not for much longer. A few weeks ago Mhairi announced that she won't be standing at the next election. Why has such an impassioned politician, especially one who's now in a leadership role, deciding to stand down at just age 28? This is the story of a tumultuous period in our politics, where rapid change has become the norm. Scottish politics is arguably even more volatile, so what is the future of the country, the SNP and the independence movement? This is a riveting, urgent listen... especially if you love video games.

He tells the hilarious inside stories of his money-shredding stunt, his challenge to David Beckham and his infamous appearance on Laura Kuenssberg's BBC show (including the after party with Rishi Sunak). Joe is a very funny man and this is a great laugh but it's also an insightful discussion about LGBT issues, social injustice and the effect his parents and the city of Birmingham had on his politics.

This is a transfixing evening in the company of a national treasure. Thoughtful, hilarious and at times emotional, Margaret reflects on the changes she's seen since first becoming an MP in 1974. Is politics less sexist than it was then? Is the Labour Party? Margaret has played a prominent role in modern Labour history for nearly 50 years and her stories about Tony Benn, John Smith, Tony Blair and others illuminate the story of the Labour Party like never before. Plus some great stories about caravanning with Special Branch...

A former Home Secretary, he doesn't hold back in his assessment of Suella Braverman and his analysis of the small boats policy is devastating. He'd led a phenomenal life and he shares hilarious stories from his time in Cabinet and the challenges he faced. He's also a mad on Sheffield Wednesday and he beautifully describes the experience of being a blind football fan. As you can hear, the audience hung on his every word... one member in particular which led to an emotional moment near the end of the show.

This is a phenomenal first-hand of account of the reality of living in Belfast during those years, what it felt like to leave and how it's shaped Andrea's approach to life and career. A career that took her all over the world as a foreign correspondent, reporting from places like Iraq and Afghanistan. You will be completely engrossed from the first second.

In fact, it's going to make you want to join a political party and get involved. It's a great inside account of what some of Labour's most infamous NEC meetings have been like, including the recent one that voted to bar Jeremy Corbyn from standing for the party. Johanna has so many great stories about helping the party function as a volunteer, what it's like having to chair party conference in an arena and how seating plans can defeat factionalism. It's a positive, optimistic and funny defence of political activism.

Not just of the BBC and Channel 4, but the whole thing. At times hilarious, this is a first-hand account of what it's like holding the powerful to account, live on TV. Clearly gifted from a young age, his TV career began at just 15. He recalls the surreal situation he found himself in: his own TV show before he'd even gone to university. As well as brilliant stories about his experiences with politicians (like Steve Baker), he also shares fascinating encounters with Robert Downey Jr, Quentin Tarantino and Jimmy Savile. This is an hour in the company of an exceptional broadcasting talent, blessed with remarkable clarity of thought.

Greg also reflects on the Hutton Report and the events surrounding his departure from the BBC, as well as sharing his insight on the pressures on any Director General. As former Chair of the FA (and Brentford), Greg gives his unique perspective on the runaway success of the Premier League that he helped found. Did he ever imagine it would end up here?

It's a candid conversation in which Ash also shares her concerns about how the contest is being run. Does her leadership campaign prove that SNP members who were once gradualists are becoming more fundamentalist? Would Ash keep the coalition with the Scottish Greens? Also, this is a conversation about how life turns out, and how things might have been different for Ash. If she'd continued living in England, would she even be in politics at all? And what do her children make of her campaign to run the country? It's a fascinating hour with someone determined to take Scotland in a different direction.

On maternity leave when Nicola Sturgeon resigned, Kate is now the most talked about politician in the UK. In this frank and open interview, she discusses her vision for the future of Scotland and the SNP. Kate also reflects on her personal resilience following the difficult birth of her daughter and how that's helped her in politics. It's a wide-ranging conversation about business, the economy and the role of government in our lives. It's also about faith in politics and the fundamentals of freedom of speech.

      "description": "Keir Starmer returns to The Political Party in scintillating form. As well as sharing some hilarious stories, mainly about what his children say to him to keep him grounded, he talks openly about recent events, including his emotional trip to Ukraine to meet Volodmyr Zelensky. Keir is open about his strategy for changing the Labour Party and reflects on the decisions that led Labour to their current poll lead. The show it's a mix of serious politics and laugh out loud moments. Keir reacts to Nicola Sturgeon's resignation but also to THAT video of Dominic Raab eyeballing him in Parliament. It's an engrossing interview with a man on the verge of becoming Prime Minister.

      "description": "This is a highly entertaining interview with the Political Editor of The Sun. Harry takes us into the modern world of the tabloid and explores The Sun's relationship with politics. How does it decide who to back at an election and has that decision been taken yet? How much politics does The Sun aim to cover? What is the balance between print and online. Ultimately this is an account of modern political journalism by a total political obsessive. It's a story about the relationship between newspapers and their readers, and why politics is about personalities.

Finally able to say what he really thinks, he delivers his analysis of politics, broadcasting, the BBC, the monarchy and pyjamas in that familiar voice. This is crammed with great stories about interviewing titans like Thatcher and Blair, as well as the reality of hosting election night TV and Question Time. It's one of the funniest and most fun episodes of the show ever recorded.

Unusually he was an MP first, but having lost his seat in 2017, was hired by Theresa May to be her most senior adviser. Gavin takes us inside the Brexit negotiations, with some surprising insights on some of Europe's major players. It's also a defence of Theresa May and the values of public service and how she contrasts with some of her successors...

      "description": "When the Prime Minister could fall at any point, talk to someone who knows what should happen next. Grant Shapps is that someone and has a very clear view on how the next Conservative leader should be chosen. He's a crucial power player and will be instrumental in any future leadership contest. Grant also has some brilliant stories about serving in Boris Johnson's Cabinet, what it was like doing the Covid TV briefings and how Liz Truss sacked him. As well as being a passionate advocate of centre-right pragmatism, he's also an optimist... despite some hellish life experiences that could easily have destroyed his positivity.

      "description": "One of the most prominent public figures of the year demonstrates why he has captured the imagination of the country. Mick Lynch has connected with people in a way that few union bosses ever will, with his dry sense of humour and direct style. He gives a fascinating insight into RMT negotiations with various transport companies, and tells us what happened off camera during some of his most notorious TV exchanges. He also reveals what his most conservative opinion is and why he'd never have a combover. It's gripping from the first minute and Mick even manages to make a discussion about the benefits of non-affiliation to the Labour Party sound entertaining. Open a can of beer, make yourself some sandwiches and enjoy the funniest conversation about trade unions you'll ever hear.

      "description": "What better time to interview a moderate former Tory MP who spent 7 years in the Treasury? David Gauke does not disappoint and is fully uncorked in this entertaining analysis of the Tories' current economic policy and the people driving it. David's story is fascinating. He went from leading Cabinet minister to ex MP within just a few months and now considers himself politically homeless. How did this happen to one of the Tories' most prominent and capable performers? It's probably not that hard to figure out but David tells his story with typical wit and warmth. He also reminisces about the coalition years, including the political legacy of austerity.

This is full of brilliant stories of trade union fist fights, his father's involvement in D Day and searing political sense. Tom was the Labour MP for his hometown from 2010 to 2017. He stood down at the 2017 election in protest against Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. That was just one of many principled decisions Tom has taken in his life.

      "description": "This is the astonishing inside account of Prince Andrew's Newsnight interview. The details will blow your mind. Sam McAlister produced the show for years and was able to convince guests to give interviews when no-one else could. In her new book 'Scoops', she takes us behind the scenes of various interviews including Julian Assange, Steven Seagal and Amy Schumer. It's a fascinating inside account of how she manages to secure the biggest guests as well as honesty about the mistakes made along the way. The years spent trying to convince Prince Andrew to do the show, the meetings she had with him before, the experience of being in that room as the interview unfolds and then his reaction afterwards will all astound you.
