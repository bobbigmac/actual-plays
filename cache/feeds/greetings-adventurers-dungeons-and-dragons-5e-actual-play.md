This special episode was done for the annual 24-hour charity stream that took place on April 26-27, 2025! The 24 hour event raised money for The Trevor Project . The Trevor Project is the leading national organization providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer & questioning (LGBTQ) young people under 25. You can find out more about this amazing organization on their website www.thetrevorproject.org .

      "description": "Over the course of the last fifteen years the lands of Drunkeros experienced great hardship and upheaval. The people of this land never gave up hope that adventurers would take up the call and become something greater - Heroes. The heroes of this land were not always correct in their decision making. They didn't always win. But, in the end, they never gave up fighting. Now, a powerful group of former colleagues, now friends and family, set their sights on what's to come and what it means to take up the burden of responsibility placed at their feet. They didn't ask for this power but they know that the good ones rarely do. The next adventurers may not involve crypts filled with fiendish horrors and treasure or tyrants needling to be toppled but whatever may come they will face it head on. Just not together. Thank you so, so, so much for joining us on this amazing adventure called making a podcast with a bunch of people you kinda knew!!! Getting to meet and interact with all of you has truly been a delight and a blessing we never thought would be possible. We cannot thank you all enough, but from the bottom of our irony poisoned hearts - Thank you. Do you want to share your own thoughts about the end of Greetings Adventurers first campaign? Well you can! We are doing a special listener episode that may feature you! Either email is at info@dndpodcast.com or call DAD-MILK-BIZ (323-645-5249‬) on your phone and leave a short message!

Instead, we got together to talk about the Black Lives Matter movement and to discuss what our community could do to help in our own small way. Our emotions ran a little raw, but as a podcast with only white folks we felt like using our reach and privilege was the absolute least we could do. Here is the google doc we discussed with links on how to support the movement and educate yourself. bit.ly/GapCastBLMResources Obviously, we want to be corrected if we spread any false information as repeating false info helps no one.

We had...a little too much fun in what we are now calling \"Fourth Episode Energy\" but in our defense the fine folks at the Strand gave us like 30 Lime, Mango and Raz ber Ritas. And we had an hour meet and greet with VIP member of the audience which absolutely sky rocketed our energy to help us make the best Live Show to date! Seriously, we cannot thank everyone enough and we look forward to many, many more shows in the future.

      "description": "Close your eyes. Imagine an idyllic tropical resort. You would imagine that they would have some sort of cabin filled with whatever your heart desires. Now imagine you are hearing screams from a pal you met on a Prison Plane. Not a fun thought, is it. That is the life of an adventurer and it is only going to get weirder. With our emotions wounds somewhat healed we must head out into the most fearsome foe yet - a corporate mixer party. What will these dreaded hellions get into to sate their dark desires? If there is a limbo and conga line we are leaving. That is the final straw.

The dragons/ dragon affiliated foes that they have fought. All of the hairs that have been tuscled. Truly, it has been a journey and a half. This is an anime-ass-recap episode! We haven't done one of these in forever so we wanted to take a stroll down memory lane as well as refresh our memories. Of course, since this is us, we had to come up with an in world justification for the recap which hope you will enjoy. Podcast art by pizzatoast ! Hosted on Acast.

But really, we are all here to celebrate the union of Aludra Wyrmsbane and Jaela, the two greatest gals in this fantastical world. Their wedding gives me hope. It gives me joy. And most importantly, if gives me an excuse to drink a few too many drinks and dance the night away in Deephome. One party is BMed (Bachelorette Master) by Toby and the other is BMed by Steve. As the parties are happening at the same time we will be going back and forth between each party. Please enjoy responsibly. (The episodes were recorded with all of Jaela's party and then all of Aludra's and David spliced them together. We were...much, much drunker in the Aludra party bits since it was an hour or so later.) Podcast art by @theZachNoll ! Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

Trust is so important these days, what with the dreaded Nareevians taking the shape of potential new friends but they are actually trying to siphon off the magical energies from a nice Elven city and overthrow a city that is often times described as a \"Jewel of the East.\" And, yes, this baseline trust can be the wholesale murder of your enemies, but be sure to keep it within reason. The adventure continues with Steve Melloncamp ( Mike Bachmann ), Aludra Wyrmsbane ( Jennifer Cheek ), Jaela ( Nika Howard ), Toby Treacletart ( Tim Lanning ) and your Dungeon Master ( Michael DiMauro ).
