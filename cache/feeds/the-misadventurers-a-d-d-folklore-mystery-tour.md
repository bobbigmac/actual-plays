  "description": "Join us as we travel through the fantasy world of D&D; fighting creatures from folk tales, forging bonds and making terrible jokes along the way! Our rag tag team consists of Ghâshbúrz, the orc-raised tiefling barbarian who’s ready for anything; Delilah, the high elf warlock ex-royalty embracing her new life of adventuring; Samuel, the human cleric who comes from humble beginnings and Isteth, the wood elf ranger returning back to civilisation with their steady aim.",
