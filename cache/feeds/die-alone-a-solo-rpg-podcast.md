      "description": "Welcome to Die Alone: a Solo RPG Podcast! Each episode I’ll be playing a different solo roleplaying or board game and talking about my experiences. I’ll also occasionally dabble in solo tabletop games and adventure gamebooks. I’ll be looking at the games as a play experience, as a meditative and creative exercise, and also looking at them from a designer and artist viewpoint. In Episode 17 of Die Alone, we take a look at BANTAM WEST from Bantam Planet and GUN COWBOY from Che. Bantam West is an “Immersive Tabletop Sim” adventure board game for 1-4 players, that unfolds in the Western town of Gallow Springs. Play as one of four Deadly Strangers on their first day in town, as they work, fight, build, and burn to become the most Notorious. GUN COWBOY is a journaling game for one player about a dead outlaw at the end of a long career. They may not know they are dead, but they are. Once, they had a gang, a posse, a crew — that's gone now, and only they (and their gun) remain. They will burn themselves up until they are nothing but bones and dust. You can get a copy of Bantam West on the Bantam Planet website: https://shop.visitbantam.com/products/bantam-west-kickstarter-edition Gun Cowboy can be found on Itch: https://sche.itch.io/gun-cowboy Back TOMBPUNK today! https://gamefound.com/en/projects/octopress/tombpunk-rpg-the-mausoleum-edition?ref=search Follow 3DIE6 on Kickstarter! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tentaclemag/3die6-rpg-second-edition-and-shimmer-guidebook?ref=clipboard-prelaunch You can find all of my RPGs and games on DriveThru RPG: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/14121/Deeply-Dapper-Games Discuss this podcast, the games I play or just solo games in general in our Facebook group.

In Episode 10 of Die Alone, I talk about the Van Ryder Game: DETECTIVE: CITY OF ANGELS Set in the dark and violent world of 1940s Los Angeles, Detective: City of Angels is a game of mystery, deception, and investigation for 1–5 players. Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD homicide detectives, hungry for glory and willing to do whatever it takes to close a case, even if that means intimidating suspects, concealing evidence, and hiring snitches to rat on their fellow detectives. One player, however, will take on the role of The Chisel, whose only goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn using bluffing, manipulation, and (often) outright lies. The game includes separate, detailed casebooks for the detectives and The Chisel. Each crime is a puzzle that can unfold in a variety of ways. As the detectives turn the city upside down, uncovering fresh evidence and \"hot\" leads, hidden suspects may be revealed and new lines of questioning will open up, creating a rich, story-driven experience!

This is a journaling game set in the Bristley Woods, a wild Scottish forest from the Beast Fables setting. This game is a collaboration between Blackwell Games and Dungeons on a Dime, revising the Apothecaria system for you to explore the massive forests of post-human Scotland as a tiny beast. Apawthecaria is a solo journaling RPG, and a spiritual successor to Apothecaria .

      "description": "Welcome to Die Alone: a Solo RPG Podcast! Each week I’ll be playing a different solo roleplaying game and talking about my experiences the following episode. I’ll also occasionally dabble in solo tabletop games and adventure gamebooks. I’ll be looking at the games as a play experience, as a meditative and creative exercise and also looking at them from a designer and artist viewpoint. In Episode 08 of Die Alone , I talk about two solo jungle games, APEX PREDATOR and THE LOST EXPEDITION. APEX PREDATOR You are not very big, and you are not very strong. There are creatures in this world that tower over you, that could absolutely tear you asunder if you let your guard down. But you are the apex predator. You will show them who is the hunter and who is the hunted. Apex Predator is a single-player game inspired by Monster Hunter, in which you explore an ancient forest, tracking down and fighting titanic monsters. Along the way, you'll face peril and find that the natural world may just be on your side. You can get Apex Predator on Itch: https://peachgardengames.itch.io/apex-predator THE LOST EXPEDITION Legendary explorer Percy Fawcett marched deep into the Amazon in search of El Dorado. He was never seen again. Your team is following in his footsteps, but in searching for riches you must be careful not to lose the greatest treasure of all - your life. Make the best of your food, your ammunition and your health, as you plunge deep into the jungle. Choose your path carefully to ensure you're ready for the pitfalls which may occur. Play solo or co-operatively to survive the expedition, or play head-to-head to see which group can reach the lost city first. From award-winning designer Peer Sylvester and acclaimed comic artist Garen Ewing, The Lost Expedition is a game of hard choices on the road to El Dorado. You can get The Lost Expedition on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2TuZNdT or from the Osprey Games Website: HERE Tabletops & Tentacles Issue 3: http://kck.st/3cZZEWE Kickstarter Links: NOVA RPG: http://kck.st/3g0C9yk The Oracle Issue 12: http://kck.st/2SY7YPN Discuss this podcast, the games I play or just solo games in general in our Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/alonepod Die Alone is on Twitter! https://twitter.com/diealonerpg Support the channel by joining our PATREON! https://www.patreon.com/deeplydapper You can also find DIE ALONE on all fine podcast aggregators: Spotify!

In Episode 05 of Die Alone , I talk about playing the tabletop heist boardgame: Burgle Bros 2: The Casino Capers by Tim Fowers Welcome back to the escapades of the Burgle Bros. The Rook, never one to shy away from the precarious, has decided to take down a string of casinos. But this is no office job - tougher safes, tightened security - and perhaps worst of all, you'll be working during the day! The team will have to dress-up (or dress-down) to go unnoticed in the casino crowds. You'll need to avoid making a commotion or taking too much heat before cracking the safe and escaping through whatever insane plan the Rook has dreamed up. You can pre-order Burgle Bros 2 HERE I focus on the solo mode of game but also touch on co-op and the overall design. I also talk about my work-in-progress solo game, Those Wretched Kids , based on the Wretched & Alone system and give an update on 3DIE6 ’s progress. Next Week: DELVE by Anna Blackwell.

The Wretched is a game about human resilience in the face of overwhelming odds and almost certain death . It is a game about isolation , fear , and perseverance . You play a lone survivor of an horrific attack. You have seen and done terrible things, you have seen your friends – your found family – brutally butchered by something you can’t even begin to comprehend, something that you were sure didn’t exist until it manifested itself aboard your ship. You are existing on the edges of your endurance, high on adrenaline and fear and desperation. You are sure you won’t survive this, but all you know to do is to keep fighting. You can find THE WRETCHED on Itch.io or in the Loot The Room Shop. (Listeners of Die Alone save 15% off orders in Loot The Room with the coupon code “3DIE6” too!) Next Week: THRU-HIKER by Daniel M.

I’ll be looking at the games as a play experience, as a meditative and creative exercise and also looking at them from a designer and artist viewpoint. I’m excited about it. In Episode 02 of Die Alone , I talk about playing the first game in the series: LONG HAUL 1983 by Sean Patrick Cain (SPC). It’s 1983, and the world feels hollowed out. LONG HAUL 1983 tells the story of a dangerous journey through an empty world. You play a long-haul truck driver trying to make their way home. Every day, you’ll hit the road, navigating treacherous highways, fleeing from menacing threats, and dealing with the psychological impacts of isolation. And at the end of each day, you’ll find a payphone, make a call, and leave a message for the most important person in your life. They never pick up. You never stop calling. Using a deck of cards, a few dice, and a microphone, players will create an original narrative of resilience in the face of world-shifting catastrophe. You can find Long Haul 1983 on Itch.io or DrivethruRPG . Next Week: THE WRETCHED by Chris Bissette. You are the last surviving crew member of the intergalactic salvage ship The Wretched . Adrift between stars after an engine failure, your ship was attacked by a hostile alien lifeform. The crew are dead. You thought you had won. You launched the creature out of an airlock, and that should have meant safety. It didn’t. The Wretched is a solo journaling RPG played with a deck of cards, a tumbling block tower, and a microphone.

      "description": "Welcome to the first episode of Die Alone: a Solo RPG Podcast! Each week I’ll be playing a different solo roleplaying game and talking about my experiences the following episode. I’ll also occasionally dabble in solo tabletop games and adventure gamebooks. I’ll be looking at the games as a play experience, as a meditative and creative exercise and also looking at them from a designer and artist viewpoint. I’m excited about it. In Episode 01 of Die Alone , I talk a bit about why I’m making this podcast and introduce the first game in the series: LONG HAUL 1983 by Sean Patrick Cain (SPC). It’s 1983, and the world feels hollowed out. LONG HAUL 1983 tells the story of a dangerous journey through an empty world. You play a long-haul truck driver trying to make their way home. Every day, you’ll hit the road, navigating treacherous highways, fleeing from menacing threats, and dealing with the psychological impacts of isolation. And at the end of each day, you’ll find a payphone, make a call, and leave a message for the most important person in your life. They never pick up. You never stop calling. Using a deck of cards, a few dice, and a microphone, players will create an original narrative of resilience in the face of world-shifting catastrophe. You can find Long Haul 1983 on Itch.io or DrivethruRPG .

      "description": "Welcome to my new podcast! With the pandemic and strangeness of the last year or so, I’ve found it harder to assemble a party for RPGs than ever before and at the same time I’ve rediscovered my love of indie Roleplaying Games which was initially frustrating. Luckily, in the indie game world there is a plethora of cool, funky, unique solo RPGs to choose from and on DIE ALONE, I’ll be picking a new one of those each week to play and discuss. The current plan is to choose an RPG and introduce it in one episode, then the following week discuss my impressions of the game and introduce the next. If there’s a recording aspect, like THE WRETCHED, which has you record a ship’s log as you play, I’ll also release those as bonus episodes. I might occasionally do solo board games as well. I’ll also post the reviews as part of our magazine Tabletops & Tentacles and on the Website . If you make solo games and have one you’d like me to play and discuss, send me an email!",
