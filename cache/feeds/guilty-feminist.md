      "description": "MINA SMALLMAN: ON MISOGYNOIR, SURVIVAL AND A BETTER TOMORROW “Race is always seen as Black men's issue, gender is always seen as white women's issue. So Black women always fall through the cracks.” Preferential acceptance rates for White women applying to UK police forces have given a false impression of gender equality, hiding acute discrimination against Black women, Media Storm data shows. This reveals the importance of understanding intersectional discrimination - and one version in particular. ‘Misogynoir’: the ingrained prejudice against Black women. This episode heroes Black women speaking about the particular prejudices they face. In a long-form interview, Mina Smallman - teacher, pastor and mother of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, whose murders exposed racist police neglect and abuse - shares the pain, passion and learnings that went into her new book, A Better Tomorrow: Life Lessons in Hope and Strength . The episode is hosted by Mathilda Mallinson (@mathildamall) and Helena Wadia (@helenawadia). The music is by Safire (@soundofsamfire).

      "description": "RAPE OFF THE RECORD: THE PRICE OF OPEN JUSTICE Media Storm’s first series featured an investigation into ‘Rape justice: ‘What happens to the 98% , when we discovered the fates of the many reported rapes that never make it to trial. Today, we speak to “the lucky ones,” the 2% of victims who get the chance to go to court. Or do they? They are told to leave the courtroom and miss the bulk of their trial… and then they must pay tens of thousands of pounds to find out what happened inside. Are government contractors getting rich off victims’ suffering? Or is someone trying to hide something? This is an investigation into the transparency of the UK’s judiciary, and the treatment of women and victims during rape and sexual assault trials. Media Storm is hosted by Mathilda Mallinson (@mathildamall) and Helena Wadia (@helenawadia). The music is by Samfire (@soundofsamfire).

      "description": "This episode is brought to you as part of Amnesty International’s Write for Rights campaign – get involved: https://tinyurl.com/3usebvje As almost every country in the world moves to steadily liberalise abortion access and women’s reproductive rights, four male presidents have done the opposite, making radical antidemocratic maneuvers to clamp down on women’s bodily autonomy. Among them, the USA, where the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade and deprived a generation of women of a constitutional right that they had grown up with. And Poland, where the Law and Justice Party has infiltrated the courts and virtually eradicated legal access to abortion. But October’s historic election overturned their majority, as women and young people flocked to the polls in record numbers. Abortion was centre stage in the campaigns and one woman’s case was at the heart of it all. Justyna Wydrzyñska is appealing a criminal conviction for sending abortion pills to a desperate woman in an abusive relationship. She joins us in an exclusive interview about feminist solidarity, hope in hard times, and the empty promises of political campaigns. We also hear from Amnesty International UK’s lead for Women’s Human Rights, Chiara Capraro, and US abortion rights activist Renee Bracey Sherman, about worldwide trends and mainstream media misinformation about abortion. The episode was created by Mathilda Mallinson (@mathildamall) and Helena Wadia (@helenawadia). The music is by Samfire (@soundofsamfire).

      "description": "Hands-up who loves a comedy podcast...all of you? We'll you're in the right place and in for a treat, as two of the UK's funniest shows collide to talk about some amazing comedy offerings available on Audible. The teams behind The Guilty Feminist and Drunk Women Solving Crime, present 'Guilty Feminists Solving Podcasts'. Deborah Frances-White joins Hannah George, Catie Wilkins, and Taylor Glenn to swap some of the fantastic original podcasts they've been listening to on Audible, which includes new shows like Lolly Adefope's 'Fanmail', a hilarious take on fame and being famous, plus some of the more established series such as the riotous 'Kurupt FM' and brilliant audio adaption of Alan Davis' TV show 'As Yet Untitled'. The gang also discusses the last time they 'mashed-up' at the London Podcast Festival, all the way back in 2019... a night none of them can remember, mainly due to the on-stage drinks trolley. Thanks so much to Audible for allowing these titans of the podcast world to get together again,and for the huge library of comedy shows to listen to! Hosted on Acast.

BOOK your tickets now: https://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/words/media-storm-2/ If you're a Lord of the Rings fan, you may know Nazanin Boniadi from her portrayal of Bronwyn in the Rings of Power. If you follow her online, you may be aware of her determined activism. Since 2008, Nazanin has represented Amnesty International’s campaigns for the restoration of stolen human rights. In the aftermath of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Nazanin's parents fled Iran for safety in London. Her fight may have started in her mother's womb, but it certainly didn't end there. Since September 2022, a new revolution has been ongoing in Iran after Mahsa Amini, a 22 year-old woman, died in police custody. Her crime? Allegedly violating Iran’s strict rules requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab. Nazanin has been fighting for the voices of Iranian women & girls to be heard worldwide. In this special episode, Media Storm hosts Helena Wadia and Mathilda Mallinson speak to Nazanin about her story, and how to report on Iran - and crises around the world - without demonising foreign cultures.

      "description": "LIVE SHOW ANNOUNCEMENT: Media Storm will be live at the London Podcast Festival this September, on Saturday 16th at 7pm! Book tickets now to join us as we breakdown the craziest headlines of 2023: https://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/words/media-storm-2/ Around the world, El Niño is causing extreme weather events and soaring global temperatures to alarming levels. Meanwhile in the UK, Labour is playing internal blame-games after a by-election defeat in Boris Johnson’s old seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip. What do these two stories have in common? Running through the UK’s political factionalism is a debate over London Mayor Sadiq Khan’s plan to expand ULEZ. This is a debate about climate policy, but climate is missing from its coverage. In this episode, Media Storm hosts Mathilda and Helena discuss the week’s top headlines and the missing links between them. They are joined by climate podcast producer Thimali Kodikara to examine what the mainstream media could be doing better in its climate coverage. The episode is created by Mathilda Mallinson (@mathildamall) and Helena Wadia (@helenawadia). The music is by Samfire (@soundofsamfire).
