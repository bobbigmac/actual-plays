      "description": "The year is 397 BE—Before the End. And in the wide and colorful abyss known as the Dragon Path, fate spins two disparate threads together… This week on Perpetua: Castle Eschatonica 01 IRC Log started Dec 21 20:37 Channel: ⁠#perpetuaSpoilers 20:37 : It's not a big deal Nei, just wish I had thought to message you about it on the forums! 20:37 : It IS a big deal. I feel like I really F***d everything up with everyone relying on me and the faq. Plus, the same thing happened to me when I tried to do the Imago walkthrough at launch without knowing there was a Chiaroscuro ending. A lot of people who were playing along with the guide got to the end and felt like they'd missed out on the true ending because they were following my advice. 20:38 : Well they should've played without a guide then. 20:38 : No one says they had to use a guide, though. 20:38 : Jinx! 20:38 : sry, i dont really get it, u think ppl on some form are gonna be mad because u didnt know about the castle? 20:38 : The forum can get pretty intense, Hoagie. I feel like people are always trying to argue over there. 20:39 : Not you though, right? n.n;;;;; 20:39 : No! I just don't like it when people get things wrong. 20:39 : Yeah, and guess who just got a BIG thing wrong. Idk guys, I think I gotta take a break until the holidays are over. I'll make a post on the forums I guess. Sorry.

      "description": "On Sunday 15th and Monday 16th of February 2026, we're going to be hosting ICEBREAKER, a two day fundraising marathon on twitch.tv/friendsatthetable to raise money for the Women's Foundation of Minnesota's Immigrant Rapid Response Fund! As Minnesota faces the brunt of a violent anti-immigrant crackdown, and ICE's cruelty continues to spread nationwide, we are inspired by the solidarity, community, and mutual aid demonstrated by those on the front lines of immigration justice. The WFM's Immigrant Rapid Response Fund distributes funding to organizations working to provide food, housing, rent relief, transportation and healthcare as well as legal support for immigrants, detainees, and their families. The fight for immigration justice is immensely important to us all. Please join us to help raise some money! In addition to streaming, new limited edition t-shirts will be available on the Friends at the Table store on Sunday 15th, featuring the incredible ICEBREAKER art by Conner Fawcett. For the months of February and March, all proceeds from any purchases made at friendsatthetable.shop will go to the Immigration Law Center of Minnesota , which provides free legal representation to immigrants and their families. After March, this t-shirt will no longer be available! Please stay tuned to our social media and here on Patreon for upcoming information about the schedule, as well as our fundraising goals. We'll be kicking off around 11am ET and going all day with a carefully selected blend of games, running the gamut from emergent multiplayer disasters to 90s educational software to — let me just check my notes here — it looks like someone's written down \"Flegg Hell\"? We'll see you on Sunday!",

      "description": "Above Spillaway Peaks, the crew of the Little Snail has found signs of a horrible corruption, tainting not only the town's oxen and their food, but perhaps of something even more fundamental. With only one clue to go one—the presumed whereabouts of a mysterious food seller—they travel further up the mountains in search of answers. What they find will draw them deeper into adventure than they ever could've imagined. Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.058] Some Feedback [Page 32 of 32] XxZelgadyskXx You KILLED the little paladin egg guy? Doom_Tree_Anne Well the thing is, the only character I had left standing was Nicky, and he'd already declared a bond of hatred against the Sentishell, and it seemed like the only winning outcome I really had left. So I didn't have a choice n.n;;;; Alukard83 That's crazy! I would just load my save if that happened to me. TheUnforgivenIII Brutal… But that's the way the world is. Sometimes its life or death. Him or you. You know? And when that happens you gotta fight with your whole heart. If you hold back at all your gonna die. Killing is what it takes to be a hero. TheDiamondRanger No way. A real hero never kills anyone, like Batman or Spider-Man. TheUnforgivenIII The real world isn't like those cartoons. It's blood in blood out, little man. Plus, Batman doesn't even have a sword. If he did, he'd probably kill a LOT of people. FriendofNei Hey, someone just sent in a tip and said that something special happens if you finish the Sentishell fight with a complete Eastern Continent Act 1 save already? Anyone do this? Did you have to do anything special? XxZelgadyskXx OMG you didn't get that????? Come onto IRC, I'll message you!

      "description": "This episode includes discussion of animal injury and illness, including descriptions of wounds and death. A mystery (and the need for a little spending money) has sent the crew of the Little Snail up into the hills of Spillaway Peaks. In between attending to their escortee, the locally famous photographer Waylon, Veile, Nicky, Jonathan, and Elena encounter the edges of a strange curse. What has happened to the Oxen of the Peaks? Can it be reversed? And what might it mean for the Perpetuan Cycle… This week on Perpetua: A PIcture of the Hills 04 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.058] NPCs & Monsters [PNMS] Waylon, Local Photographer [NMWY] Traits: Stubborn, Experienced, Prickly, Soft-Hearted Stats: ??? Attacks: ??? Special Abilities: ??? In-Game Description: Spillaway Peaks local photographer has been serving the community for hundreds of years. His hard shell covers a soft interior. To be honest, I haven't actually seen Waylon's \"soft-heart\" yet, but maybe that'll come in time. Starter Tip: If you fail to convince him to make a detour while you grind or do other side quests, do NOT let him wander away! He will immediately start taking damage once you're on a different screen. Brown Flegg [NMBF] Typical Traits: Mischievous, Stubborn, Direct, Family Oriented Stats: DEX 8, INS 8, MIG 8, WLP 8 Attacks: Flegg Strike, Infuriate, Flegg Gale Special Abilities: Stoneshell In-Game Description: A living egg. It comes up to your shins. Hey, why are these ones brown!? A leveled up version of the classic Flegg. They're level 10, so expect a higher HP pool. Their Flegg Gale also gives them a little extra \"oomph.\" Be careful if you have a status that weakens you to Air damage! Starter Tip: Their resistances and vulnerabilities are different than the base Flegg. These ones are strong against both earth and fire damage, but are weak to poison! Sentishell [NMSS] Traits: Justice-Seeking, Protective, Noble Stats: DEX 8, INS 8, MIG 8, WLP 8 Attacks: Hilt Bash, Holy Slash Special Abilities: Holy Aegis, Stoneshell, Threaten In-Game Description: Extra-large, light-green Flegg with brown splotches. Wears shining platemail armor and helm, visor raises so that you can see his brave expression. Wields a long sword and Kite shield commensurate to his size. A Paladin-type Flegg!? Yup, your eyes aren't deceiving you. This little guy has pretty standard stats, but lots of defensive moves to help keep him and his crew safe from incoming damage. I wonder if we could recruit him to OUR side. Starter Tip: Both his Holy Aegis and Threaten skills can be canceled by hitting him with either Dark or Lightning damage! So prioritize those!

      "description": "Though the office of the Shining Star stands on the second of Spillaway Peaks' three tiers, on a clear night, its rooftop beacon can be seen from miles away. This, Thelonious, the newspaper's editor-in-chief says, is a recruitment strategy. Those who see the light and travel through the wilderness towards it tend to be inquisitive and adventurous enough to make good freelance reporters. And though they followed the Shining Star's reputation before its shining light, couldn't the same be said of the crew of the Little Snail? This week on Perpetua: A Picture of the Hills 03 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.058] Side Quests[SDQS] Spillaway Peaks [SPSQ] Escort the Waylon the Photographer - 300 Asta Description: It's time for Old Waylon to take the yearly photo of the town. Guard him on his journey up the mountains to the best angle. Definitely take this quest before leaving town. You're gonna be going up that way to do other side quests anyway, and while Waylon isn't worth a damn in a fight, he also doesn't actually cause you too much trouble as long as you keep up with him! Terrapin Interest Story - 25 to 425 Asta Description: The Shining Star is paying for feature stories about the people of Spillaway Peaks. Brainstorm an idea, interview your subjects, write your article, and supplement it with art! This one is a pain in the butt and it seems really random how much you make from it. Basically, you pick from easy to difficult in each phase of the quest (topic, interview, etc.) and depending on how you do, you get more money. Each of the topics also requires you to go to different places, so like if you do a story on the school play, you have to go to the Clutch area to interview parents and children, where as if you do a story on the port's guards, you need to go down to the water to talk to them. I guess if you really need the Asta, go for it. Investigate the Livestock Deaths - 400 Asta Description: Beula's Giant Oxen have been getting sick, and some have even been dying! This is a problem, since it's almost time to dredge up new Rice Paddies. Though this looks like a side quest, it's basically mandatory. Unless you were inducted into the Luminaries by Commodore Onyx before leaving Calstega Bay, when you meet with Thelonious, he'll basically put you on a path to do this quest. As such, go read the main Calstega Bay quest section of the FAQ to learn more about this one. Kill 17 Frostoads - 100 Asta Description: N/A I honestly don't understand why this one is even on this side quest board. Isn't it supposed to be a newspaper? Why would they pay you to kill random toads? There's not even a description on it! Paper Delivery - 20 Asta Description: Deliver the Shining Star to all 15 of its readers. Okay, so, you have to go from the Shining Star to 15 different NPCs spread all across the town. And with a 20 Asta reward, it sounds like a really boring fetch quest that just wastes your time right? Well. I guess I won't say it isn't a time waster. But the important thing is that you can do this once per every Rest action. And because you can stay for free in Jonathan's family's house… that's right. It seems like you can just grind money here indefinitely. I say \"seems\" because I haven't tested it yet, and there is a chance that just resting repeatedly and not advancing the main plot could have consequences, like it did in Shine-Divine War Armidirge. So be careful, but let me know what happens if you do try to get infinite money here!

      "description": "The crew of the Little Snail has come to Spillaway Peaks in search of an ally: Thelonious, the editor-in-chief of the Shining Star newspaper and a member of the mysterious group called the Luminaries. But before they can go, meet Theo, and earn his trust, they first have to do a little shopping… This week on Perpetua: A Picture of the HIlls 02 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.058] Town Maps [TNMP] Spillaway Peaks [SPMP] The Shell Barrow You know that big dome you can see at Spillaway Peaks from the world map? Yeah, this is it. This is where they do their \"Weekly Rehearsal,\" which is like Church Sunday for them. Depending on how things go, you can visit this place at the end of the arc and get a buff. The Clutch This is where Terrapine kids grow up and go to school. You can get a pretty good Jonathan scene if you go here, but that's about it for now. The Docks and Administrative District There's not much here, except a way to get back on the Ferry and head back to Calstega Bay Jonathan's Family Home This is the only of the Clan Homes you can actually enter, but it's pretty big! It's four or five levels high (depending on how you count) and there are a ton of rooms to explore, random NPCs to talk to, and some loot too! If you do a side quest for Jonathan's dad, he can build you some gear in his workshop! The Shining Star The town newspaper. If you're ready to advance the main plot, head up to the second floor of the Shining Star. You'll automatically run into Theolonius (and Jonathan's sister is working there as an intern or something, too). But if you aren't ready yet, you can stay downstairs and use the quest board to grind out some XP and asta! Shopping District The highest level of the Spillaway City map (not counting the Spillaway Outskirts, but there you have to load out to the world map before getting there, so I don't count it!) There are three main shops here. A general store, which basically just lets you recover IP and get basic items, and then Abelene's Armory and Stokely's Specialties. Abelene's Armory Armor: Reinforced Mud Suit 300 asta | 11 Phys Def / INS size +1 Mdef | -5 Init | Earth Resistant Armor: Meditation Robe 1000 asta | Def: DEX die +1 / MDEF: INS die +2 |-2 Init Whenever you recover Mind Points, you recover 5 extra Mind Points. Armor: Choir Robe 1000 asta | Def: DEX size +1 / Mdef: INS size +2 |-2 Init Counts as 1 bonus SL of \"Sound Barrier\": After you sing a verse with medium or high volume, all physical damage you suffer until the start of your next turn is reduced by【SL】(applied before Affinities). Shield: Eyecatching Cape 800 z | +2 Def /+0 Mdef As long as you don't have a martial armor or another shield equipped, you may apply the effects of the Dodge Skill (see Core Rulebook, page 203). Shield: Seasoned Potlid 1500 asta | Martial |+2 Def /+2 MDef When you deal damage with a delicacy (see page 151), you deal 5 extra damage. Shield: Plated Tambourine 1700 asta | +2 Def / +0 Mdef If you have the Resonance Skill , consider your Skill Level in it increased by 2 (up to a maximum of SL 5). Weapon: Giant Fork 1000 asta | DEX + MIG | HR + 16 | Martial | Physical Damage | Spear | Two-handed | Melee | When you use this weapon with the Knife and Fork Skill, you may add the High Roll to the attack's damage (you don't have to treat it as being equal to 0). Weapon: Electrified Flyswatter 1300 asta | MIG + DEX | HR+10 | Bolt Damage | One-handed | Melee You may attack Flying creatures, but you take -3 to the roll. Stokely's Specialties Accessory: Ring of the Occultist - 600 asta Spells you cast with a target of \"Up to three creatures\" instead have a target of \"Up to four creatures\" (you must still spend additional Mind Points for the fourth target). Accessory: Spare Magicannon Chamber - 800 When you summon a Magicannon, you also receive an extra Elemental Chamber, matching the previous elemental type you stored.

      "description": "On the western continent of Perpetua, four fated adventurers set out on a prophesied journey. While to the east, in the Elevana League, a trio of travelers began to investigate a metaphysical sickness. What, if anything, connected these two groups? Who was powerful enough, invested enough, to watch each from above or below—besides you and I? Perhaps, if not for the impending stress of a familial reunion and the ever present struggle between one's responsibilities to their culture and to themselves, the brilliant, Terrapine inventor Jonathan would find the perspective necessary not simply to answer these questions, but to intuit that they exist at all. Yes, I think that if it were laid out for him, he would see the patterns by now, the etchings and the echoes. But we… We have the perspective, the maps, the right roles: Storyteller and listener. And we have the chapters open in front of us: The Shadow of the Dragon Tower. The Flames of Burzin, Journey to the Bay. On Track to Iron Chains. Sizzling Rivalry. Crashing Waves. A Roar Across Cenn. Aquatic Ambush. In Too Deep. Indeed, those seven adventurers were themselves \"in too deep\" to know what was about to happen, to sense that there even were other heroes like themselves, whose stories carried a strange and powerful resonance. You will learn soon that they were not the only heroes across Perpetua's many cycles. And perhaps this will be part of a new map you can come to understand in time. A map which will raise a new question: Are these echoes part of a careful, yet uncanny balance in the cosmic play of our lives? Or a poetic rhyming that keeps existence itself aligned? This week on Perpetua: Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.058] Some Feedback [Page 29 of 30] CarlsSr Hey I have a question: Why does Jonathan's family suck so much @$$? XxZelgadyskXx Great question Carl! Nice to see you make a more substantive post! I definitely understand why it might seem that some of his family isn't great, but I think they're just frustrated with how long he's been away. Even for a Terrapine, that many decades seems like a long time! It also seems like they're going through a little bit of a family crisis with how his mom is getting older and sicker. Maybe if we saw them in the old days, before he left, they'd be a little more likable! TheUnforgivenIII Yeah right, once an asshole, always an asshole. The truth is that Jonatahna is a bad ass who doesn't need his family. They can't make flaming guns out of thin air. They don't have a sick ride. All they do is hold a guy like him back. Plus their music f'ing SUCKS. Doom_Tree_Anne Wow Zelgadysk, do you ever do any RP on IRC? Sounds like you'd play a great Jonathan. XxZelgadyskXx No comment! But join the server, I'm sure some people would love to talk RP with you. Alukard83 I think it's easy to get mad at a video game family that's been written to make you mad. Real family is tougher to deal with, because a lot of times you love the same people who really tick you off. That shit is tough! CarlsSr Yeah. [Extra words added to reach minimum word count.] XxZelgadyskXx Do you think Jonathan's little sister feels the same way about him that you feel about your family, Unforgiven? TheUnforgivenIII I didn't say SHIT about my family, asshole. My dad is a kick ass bike mechanic and my mom used to be a rock station DJ. Way cooler than Jonathan's dumbass church family.

      "description": "A sudden confrontation! Having 'sniffed out' a lead, Antistrophe, Brontë, and Caoimhe have dug their way towards the truth. That truth rests in the underground archive of the Hexcloaks' regional headquarters in Cenn, City of Iron Chains. But such a basement does not go unguarded. To arms, Team ABC! This week on Perpetua: In Too Deep 03 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.055] NPCs & Monsters [PNMS] Hortensius, Venomous Hexcloak [NMHR] Traits: Joyful, Experimental, Cruel Stats: DEX 6, INS 10, MIG 6, WLP 10 Attacks: Toxic Whip, Poison Cloud Special Abilities: Heal In-Game Description: A misanthropic hexcloak with a mastery of toxins, venoms, and other poisons. Hortensius may not seem like the most dangerous of the Cenn Hexcloak Trio, but his mastery of poisons means that he can really wear you down (or set you up for another of the trio to knock you out.) Unsurprisingly, he resists poison damage. Starter Tip: Poison Cloud can hit everyone, and it always hits. Get ready to use some tonics! Maxi, Earthen Hexcloak [NMMX] Traits: Tough, Direct, Snobbish Stats: DEX 10, INS 6, MIG 12, WLP 6 Attacks: Stone Maul Special Abilities: Status Immunity, Stoneshield In-Game Description: A Hexcloak soldier who combines expertise of earthen enchantment with finely honed martial prowess. Maxi is proof that sometimes all you need is a big stick. She doesn't have special attacks or active abilities, just a collection of strong defensive passives and a really high Might (which she tends to keep high because of her Status Immunity ability). Starter Tip: She resists both earth and, more importantly, physical damage. Spell damage is your best bet here! Mercurion, Voltaic Hexcloak [NMMR] Traits: Laconic, Rude, Mercurial Stats: DEX 10, INS 10, MIG 6, WLP 6 Attacks: Electrified Dagger, Hexipistol, Fulgur Special Abilities: Flying (Bugged?) In-Game Description: Impudent in speech. Electric in action. Mercurion seems to be the leader of the Cenn Hexcloak Trio, and for good reason. They can dish out big damage QUICK with their Fulgur ability (and it also has a low chance of making you dazed). Try to knock them down even quicker, or else Hortensius' heal will make them a real pain in your behind. Starter Tip: The game says they're flying, and they have a hovering animation, but some people have reported that Mercurion isn't actually flying in their boss fight. So don't worry if it seems broken, it's just a bug!",

      "description": "Castine, Living Metal, has retreated to his chambers to channel his power. An ancient dragon continues to slam at the city's protective dome. Kley Kaina has been dragged away by Commander Thereus Aegir. Something suspicious lurks inside the Hexcloak Headquarters of Cenn, City of Iron Chains. And Antistrophe Landrace, Brontë Adelvys and Caoimhe Wake have pledged to get to the bottom of it… literally. This week on Perpetua: In Too Deep 02 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.055] Dungeon Maps [DNMP] Cenn Tunnels Map [CTDM] Honestly, even though there are a few spots where you can get into fights, it's hard to call the Cenn Tunnels a dungeon. But because there's a boss fight at the end, and secrets throughout, I decided to put the maps here. It's important to remember that you can dig anywhere but only the spots I've marked here will lead to anything. Don't waste your time digging into empty hollow areas! Map Map with Solution S - Starting Point Whenever you leave from here, all the enemies encounters down here will re-populate. So if you really wanna grind during this section of the game, this is probably the only place to do it. 1 - Wormking Nest If you are desperate for XP, you can dig into this hollow in order to fight a wormking (it's like a ratking but for worms). Each time you dig a new passage into this zone, another battle will start. Not worth the time in my opinion, but maybe it's worth it if you're right at the edge of a level! 2 - Buried Dig Site An old dig site from before Castine's Moon appeared a hundred years ago. There's a few random valuables that you can find here. I got a golden shovel! 3 - Ore Vein You can get some upgrade materials here. Especially useful if you're trying to upgrade Antistrophe's shields! 4 - Flegg Alcove Three level-synched fleggs will spawn here as soon as you enter the tunnels at point S. If you take too long, they'll start wandering around and can actually ambush you! E - Exit This is where you can start digging your way towards the Hexcloak Headquarter Basement. Make sure you're all healed up and ready for a boss fight!

      "description": "A confrontation with the Hexcloak Commander, whose ominous air suggests dire motives. A conversation with the living god of metal, whose curious mind pries into their own. A conflict with an ancient draconic mole, whose thunderous anger threatens the city of chains. Antistrophe Landrace, Bronte Adelvys, and Caoimhe Wake have faced all of this and more during their stay in Cenn. And yet, for now, they've remained to help the city—now blocked off from the rest of the world by a massive sphere of pure iron—as it rebuilds from the dragon's earth-shaking attack. A city as great as Cenn can recover, but it needs more than time. People need healing. Structures need mending. Fearful spirits need to be calmed. But mysteries abound. Where is Kley Kaina? What is the sourcerot? How are the hexcloaks involved? Lost, they turn to a pair of surprising allies. Johnny Cakes and Jimmy Cones. Mango Chili Chutney. Pineapple Basil. Matcha Sesame Brittle. Mango Habanero. Lavender Lemonade. Coconut Lime Sorbet. Lemon Basil Sorbet. Beetroot Ginger Swirl. These are the leading flavors of Cakes and Cones Ice Cream this year. Sold and delivered across Cenn by the Dessert Brothers' team of noble White Caps, whose confectionary comportment gives them access to the lowest of gutters and the highest halls of power. Perhaps these ice cream boys will have the perspective that team ABC needs to crack their investigation wide open. Or, perhaps, the clue is closer than that, mixed in with the dairy and the fruit and the flavor extract and the sugar, buried in the tasty, tasty cream itself. This week on Perpetua: In Too Deep 01 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.055] Some Feedback [Page 25 of 27] Doom_Tree_Anne What do you think every party member's favorite flavor of Ice Cream is? Personally, I think Veile likes Mango Chili Chutney and Elena likes Mango Habanero. For obvious reasons. CarlsSr The best flavor is chocolate. Doom_Tree_Anne But chocolate isn't on the list of available flavors from the Desert Bros., which is actually FASCINATING because of the lore implications. It suggests one of two things is true: Either the people of Cenn (or perhaps the Elevana League, or even the whole Eastern Continent) don't have a taste for it (which is hard to believe!), OR they don't have access to the cacao plant, which would mean no chocolate. In fact, the inclusion of TWO mango flavors might suggest that the flora of Perpetua is more closely tied to that of the Indian Subcontinent and the rest of Southeast Asia. I visited my grandmother in Indonesia when I was on summer break between high school and college, and she had a HUGE mango tree in her back yard! XxZelgadyskXx That's really cool Anne, but remember, Elena did mention chocolate in the marshmallow scene! :3 Anyway, I think Antistrophe probably likes the Matcha one. I haven't had it, but I looked it up and it looks green and healthy, and he seems like someone who takes care of his body in that way. And I think Jonathan would do the Pineapple Basil. I don't know why, I just do. TheUnforgivenIII Sorry Doomtree, we don't really have a good answer for this. Maybe if Nei actually kept this FAQ updated like it was SUPPOSED TO BE then we'd know what all the flavors do and what the the best ones are for each character. TheDiamondRanger I read in a preview that all the flavors get randomized when you start the game, so that doesn't make sense. Alukard83 I think that's only for Nicky's abilities. Anyway, Bronte likes the most expensive flavor for sure. And I think Unforgiven doesn't like getting any dessert at all because he's always so rude!

      "description": "The Little Snail floats aboard Captain Hornbeam Hypostyle's Crystal Conch Express, strapped down to its large, open deck, cutting a boxy silhouette against the light of the horizon. Beautiful though it may be, it also sends a sharp signal to any ill-willed onlookers: There is cargo aboard! It is for this reason that Captain Hypostyle does not like to transport vehicles across the bay… This week on Perpetua: Aquatic Ambush! 02 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.05] NPCs & Monsters [PNMS] Kay - Clay Crewman [NMKAY] Typical Traits: obedient, learning, gullible Stats: DEX 10, INS 6, MIG 10, WLP 6 Attacks: Arm Club, Clay Toss Special Abilities: Construct, Self-Repair In-Game Description: A strange, humanoid figure seemingly made from red-brown clay. No facial features, fine details, or clothing. The Klaye Pirates are a group you'll get used to fighting if you end up doing a lot of sea travel in the game. They're like the main humanoid enemy group there. And the Kays are the lowest rank Klayes, so you'll fight them the most. The good news is they're really straight forward, especially since they're weak to fire. They're strong and fast physical damage dealers, and they can self-heal in a pinch, but that's about it. Starter Tip: Their \"self-repair\" heal is really annoying! If you have one in crisis, it's worth knocking it out! (That's a good tip in general too: You almost always want to tackle one enemy at a time, so that you can reduce the incoming damage you're taking quicker! Don't spread your damage around. Focus wins fights!) Kel - Stony Sailor [NMKEL] Typical Traits: bold, carefree, salty Stats: DEX 8, INS 8, MIG 8, WLP 8 Attacks: Clay Cutlass, Flint Flintlock Special Abilities: Counterslash, Self-Repair+ In-Game Description: A humanoid made from clay, with baked-in sailor's garb. If the Kays are the Klaye Pirates low level grunts, I guess the Kels are sort of their average workhorse. Their Flintlock attack can target two of your party members each round, and their counterslash makes it a pain to do melee damage to them. The good news is that they're weak to bolt damage, so blast em from above and watch them break into little pieces! Starter Tip: As constructs, they're immune to poison damage (and the poisoned status) and resistant to earth damage! Don't waste your time, just smash 'em! Klaw - Muddy Mate [NMKLW] Typical Traits: ??? Stats: ??? Attacks: ??? Special Abilities: ??? In-Game Description: ??? I haven't actually fought one of these yet (so I haven't had the chance to do a study action on them), but one got added to the fight just before I escaped to Spillaway Peaks, so I saw the name. Anyone know what the deal is? Starter Tip: Kay, Kel, Klaw. What is up with these names?

      "description": "Before he departed from Calstega Bay, the man named Onyx, Commodore of the Valte Empire and member of the mysterious group known as the Luminaries, gave the crew of the Little Snail some words of advice: Take a boat east, to Spillaway Peaks, and find an ally there under the Shining Star. Thus do Veile, Elena, Nicky, and Jonathan head towards the shoreline, towards new adventures—and for one of them, old haunts. You may not know Spillaway Peaks. Indeed, places like that are too easily overlooked. Many would tell you a history of Tidaline, Perpetua's Western Continent, focused only on its greatest kingdom, its most powerful church, and the invading armada that scourges its shores. And while Grand Sonnerie, the Holy Protectorate, and the Valte Empire have tried as hard as they can to control the chronicling of time, take it from this old historian: The smallest gust can usher in a hurricane. So learn these names: Belowave. Geseis. Nezt. Invernal. Salann. Burgton. Stitchscore. Spillaway Peaks. Cities hidden under the waves or behind the hills. Places which turned away warships with simple ribbons, or confounded pillagers with puzzles. One village of games, one village of spies, one village where soldiers refused to be soldiers anymore. Call them parochial or call them provincial if you must, but understand this. Perpetua is not the territory of territory alone. It is not a battlefield made by battalions. It is a world where heroes move history, and where heroes have homes. Some such heroes, if they are lucky, may even get to return to them one day. This week on Perpetua: This week on Pepetua: Across the Bay Pt. 1 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.05] NPCs & Monsters [PNMS] Hydrazoa [NMHDZ] Typical Traits: floating, glowing, silent, transparent Stats: DEX 8, INS 8, MIG 10, WLP 6 Attacks: Acid Touch, Stinging Tentacles Special Abilities: Flying In-Game Description: Every slithering tentacle of these bizarre, floating jellyfish monsters is filled with a powerful neurotoxin. As far as I can tell, the only way to encounter these guys is by generating an ambush on the shoreline or in the sea. And something is really FISHY about these jellyfish, too. They have original art, but it's almost like they're ripped directly from a different game in terms of their moves and stats and even their description! Maybe they're a holdover from the original Fabula Ultima game engine? Starter Tip: Even though they do bolt damage with those tentacles, they're also weak to bolt! They might sting you, but sting 'em right back. Living Seaweed [NMLSW] Typical Traits: aggressive, cursed, quick, tangly Stats: DEX 10, INS 8, MIG 8, WLP 6 Attacks: Corrupting Grasp, Dark Sting Special Abilities: Plant In-Game Description: A tangle of ravenous kelp. I don't really get this thing. It's like some seaweed that wants to choke you? Why. It doesn't have teeth. It doesn't have a mouth. It doesn't have a stomach. Seaweeds don't need to kill to survive. So why is this one trying to munch on the party! Starter Tip: Don't even bother to give them dazed, enraged, or shaken. They're immune!",

      "description": "Cenn, City of Chains shakes and rumbles. A threat once only felt through the tremors of the ground emerges, claws long, hide scaled, and sharp… sharp all over. Even whiskers sharp. A master of the earth. A being that digs not only through the earth, but through—or around, or perhaps outside of—time itself! The Draco-Mole appears! This week on Perpetua: A Roar Across Cenn 04 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.05] NPCs & Monsters [PNMS] Rotten Draco-Mole [NMGNS] Traits: Frenzied, Confused, Furious, Single-Minded Stats: DEX 6, INS 6, MIG 12, WLP 8 Attacks: Stone Cage, Heavy Claw, Plate Swipe Special Abilities: Dragon's Breath, Rub Some Dirt On It!, Dig In-Game Description: A massive, draconic mole shaking with an ancient power. Chances are that you managed to de-escalate or speed through the Kalsi confrontation, which means that there's a good chance that this will be the first \"real\" boss fight for your eastern party campaign. So: Make sure to come in prepared: Rest up (and use your most combat-focused camp activities). Top up on inventory points. Make sure you get your equipment sorted. And then go fight a big friggin' dragon! This thing (which I heard you can learn the 'real' name of, but I haven't found it yet) is TOUGH. A ton of HP and really solid defense compared to most enemies you've fought so far. Plus, it has a full set of elemental resistances, immunities, and weaknesses. It doesn't take \"neutral\" damage from ANYTHING. Focus on Dark, Light, and Poison damage if you have any abilities, and don't forget about the power of elemental shards! In terms of staying safe, the Rotten Draco-Mole mostly does physical and earth damage, so prep to resist that, too. You should also try to time your healing right. When it hides underground, that's your chance to spend a turn licking your own wounds (just like it can do!). Starter Tip: STONECAGE DOES NOT GO AWAY ON ITS OWN. You have to break the walls or dig the person stuck inside out yourself. Prioritize this!",

      "description": "All across the Elevana League, pilgrims leave their homes and travel over great distances towards the city of Cenn, determined to meet with the only member of the Ennead who deigns to walk amongst their worshippers. As a matter of propriety and faith, what transpires between Castine and his believers is largely kept between the embodiment of metal and his visitors. But it is not uncommon to see echoes of the conversations in the life that follows. Greater confidence. Lesser cruelty. A new found curiosity. When you walk your lap with the Living Metal, it is said, you may find yourself newly tempered. This week on Perpetua: A Roar Across Cenn 03 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.05] Some Feedback [Page 22 of 24] Alukard83 What do you think you'd ask Castine if you could walk with him? FriendOfNei You actually can if you get the right answers during the Temple Infiltration. But that's a good question, I'll load my backup save and try to update the FAQ soon with as many answers as I can get from him soon! Alukard83 Oh thanks. But I meant in real life. Like would you ask about the future or about the past or maybe about some secret only he would know? TheDiamondRanger I'd ask him where the ultimate weapons are! TheUnforgivenIII Wow, a rare good question from Reverse Dracula. I think I'd ask about my grandparents (mom's side). Never really got to know them. XxZelgadyskXx I don't know that Castine knows about stuff like that. He seems more into like, statues and shovels and things made of metal. XD Alukard83 I mean he's a God right? God is omni-scient, so he'd have to know about things like TUIII's grandparents. Even if we just meant in Perpetua and not IRL, he could watch them from like… candle sticks and forks and stuff right. CarlsSr god doesn't exist lol Doom_Tree_Anne I think it's a good question, Alukard83! From what I've read, it's not clear what exactly Castine (or God, if she DOES exist, I'm agnostic) can or can't do. Sure, there's clearly a lot of miraculous and powerful stuff that happens in the story (game and IRL religions). But there are always limits, right? Like how Castine couldn't see into the Hexcloak office because Aegir did that trick with the light and with Caoimhe's sword, or how in real life, a supposedly benevolent (that means kind and loving) God lets bad things happen to people. But that doesn't mean that they aren't loving. Just that they aren't actually all powerful. A lot like us. Anyway I thought it was a good question so I wrote a fic about it over on the Creative Writing board. If you search for \"Walking In Iron Shoes\" you should be able to find it. Let me know what you think n.n;;; TheDiamondRanger What's a fic???

      "description": "After an ominous meeting with Thereus Aegir, leader of the Hexcloaks, Caoimhe Wake regroups with Brontë Adelvys and Antistrophe Landrace, fresh from their victorious Beachminton showdown in Seawalk. Caoimhe shares the ultimatum she received from Aegir: Find out whether the recent earthquakes are tied to Castine, Living Metal. Which raises the question: How does one go about investigating a member of the Ennead while he is surrounded by his most loyal followers? This week on Perpetua: A Roar Across Cenn 02 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.05] NPCs & Monsters [PNMS] I've been waiting to put these in until we had stats, but I guess we just aren't getting those during the early acts. Jimmy Cone & Johnny Cakes [NMJJC] Traits : Arrogant, Ambitious, Competitive, Playful Stats : ??? Attacks : Ace Killer, Back to the Fundamentals, Big Little Bro Backhand, Big Little Bro Beachminton Bash, Classic Comeback Shot, Desperate Dexterous Swing, Dexterous Hit, Final Shot, Jimjam Slam, NORMAL OL' HIT, Patty-Cake Patty-Cake Baker's Lob, Rapid Fire Double Down Super Shot, Slippy Slappy Overhand, Signature Dexterous Hit, Veteran's Return Spells : ??? In-Game Description: Brotherly heirs to the Cenn City dessert empire. Sigh. I don't really get it. Why do they share a character profile page when they clearly have different stats? Why aren't their stats visible even after you beat them in Beachminton. Is their whole concept some sort of reference I don't get? I think this game is pretty funny, but every comedian has some bad jokes. Kley Kaina [NMKLA] Traits : Skeptical, Mysterious, Just, Vengeful Stats : ??? Attacks : ??? Spells : ??? In-Game Description : Caoimhe's childhood friend, a Poison Elf who has trained to be a doctor. Somewhere along the way, they developed strange allegiances. You know when you watch an anime and you go \"I hope that side character gets a whole episode?\" That's how I feel about Kley. What's their deal!? Why are they so pissed off about Caoimhe joining the Hexcloaks. And what \"strange allegiances\" do they have? Delani Kaina [NMDLK] Traits: Faithful, Brusque, Determined, Demanding Stats: ??? Attacks : ??? Spells: ??? In-Game Description : Kley Kaina's mother and a loyal follower of Castine. On a pilgrimage to Cenn. I wish she wasn't so mean to Kley, but I can't help but like her. It's funny that she has a big crush on Castine, it's sort of like being in love with a Greek God, but I guess that happened in myths too so why not in a game? Thereus Aegir [NMTHA] Traits : ??? Stats : ??? Attacks : ??? Spells : ??? In-Game Description : Leader of the Hexcloaks. \"Leader of the Hexcloaks.\" That's it!? You couldn't even say \"Cruel leader of the Hexcloaks\" or \"Mysterious leader of the Hexcloaks?\" Not saying more makes him even MORE mysterious. And why are his TRAITS hidden? It's not like he's hiding being a jackass, he just is one! Athon, Castine's High Cleric [NMATH] Traits : Devoted, Strict, Punctual, Knowledgeable Stats : ??? Attacks : ??? Spells : ??? In-Game Description : Castine's chief attendant, responsible for the affairs of his Temple. Athon is sort of a mirror. If you choose all the hostile dialog options, he's a real prick back to you. If you choose all the more quiet, humble ones, he'll reflect respect back to you. I'm not sure it really matters if you piss this guy off or not, but if you don't want to get scolded, just be polite and patient. Castine, Living Metal [NMCLM] Traits : Curious, Mercurial, Empathetic, Caring Stats : ??? Attacks : ??? Spells : ??? In-Game Description : Second newest member of the Ennead. Connected to metal and physical damage. I have some guesses about what \"second newest\" member of the Ennead means, but that's it for now. Here's my big theory though: There's gotta be some connection between him and Scintero, since Scintero is \"Living Bolt\" and Castine is \"Living Metal,\" right?

      "description": "Called to Cenn, City of Iron Chains, Caiomhe Wake, Antistrophe Landrace, Brontë Adelvys (and his two attendants), arrive to find crisis rumbling in burg. The Hexcloaks have quietly taken over town governance, while outside, tremors have turned to quakes, even bringing harm to the Ironclad Parade—the statuary whose inhabitants were once devotees to Castine, Living Metal. Perhaps such devotion is earned in part by the curious community that Castine has built here in Cenn since his arrival a century ago. While the archeological dig that gave Cenn its full moniker continues, the city is now known just as well for the smells of its sizzling food, its many seaside diversions, and the spiritual contemplation offered by the lunar temple that graces the moon resting at its center. There, Castine walks with pilgrims who have traveled seeking his company, his wisdom, or his divine favor. But however pure he's kept his temple, he could never keep it safe from the prying eyes of the other members of the Ennead: Ryme, Master of Ice. Lucena, Bringer of Light. Zephius, the Old Wind. Gritt of the Earth. Scintero, Living Bolt. Cinner, Soldier of Ash. Pharmakos the Poisoner. Caliginia, Fated Darkness. None of these divine beings are omniscient, and none omnipotent, but each is capable, powerful, and driven by their own ends, their own understanding of responsibility, and their own relationship to the Perpetuan Cycle. \"What must they think,\" you might wonder, \"about the Sourcerot, which threatens to end the world ahead of its scheduled decline? What must they think about these heroes journeying across continents in search of destiny?\" Well, my own thoughts will be saved for now. But soon, in the city of Cenn, one so-called god will speak. This week on Perpetua: Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.05] MiniGames and Side Activities [MGSA] Wordzin [MGWZ] In-Game Description: A word-association game with its origins in the Elevana League town of Burzin. You're prompted with one word and then you're given a choice of words to pick that all could be associated with that first word. Your goal is to pick the same word as the second \"dealer.\" At first, I thought that this game was totally random, but after talking to people on the forum, it sounds like you can start to predict what style of word the computer will pick based on which dealer modeler is being used. The one with the long fancy mustache tends to pick adjectives fancy words and is the only one who uses adverbs. The lady with the big eyes tends to pick animals and weapons. The guy with the apron on picks verbs the most (but not exclusively). When you get the twin dealers, though, it IS totally random! I guess it's like they have an inside joke going? Calstega Cook Off! [MGCO] In-Game Description: After the success of the first cooking competition, the people of Northcrook decided to run a regular Cook Off competition as part of a 'neighborhood revitalization' effort. The game basically counts on you paying attention during the first time this minigame shows up, because there is NO tutorialization after that. You're just dropped back into the town as if you're not even in a minigame. Once I loaded a save and was confused why I couldn't even leave the screen, because I forgot I saved after starting the Cook Off! So : Step 1: Pay attention to the theme of Cook Off is. They say this up top and will NOT repeat it. 2. Try to learn the judge's tastes. Most of the time you can do this through a few skill checks, but once I had to do a duel, and once they made me do this weird tower puzzle (a minigame INSIDE of a minigame!?). 3. Come with good ingredients. Even though you can normally buy ingredients inside of a settlement (you have been doing that, right?) you can't do it once you start the Cook Off! Beachminton [MGBM] In-Game Description: The favorite pastime of Cenn's beach goers. Hit the Sandy Shuttlecock onto your opponent's side, but be careful not to break it! I don't know anything about real badminton, except that every single word associated with it is funny. But Beachminton is pretty simple: Look at the sand ball to see how close it is to breaking apart: if it's in crisis you can see sand falling off of it while its in slow motion between rounds. If it's close to breaking, try to hit it with your weakest character and use any tricks you can to do low damage. If it's not close to breaking, try to hit it as hard as you can. At least that's how I play!

      "description": "After escaping one ambush in their hotel room and a second aboard the Buzzard Black, the crew of the Little Snail is finally preparing themselves for their climactic showdown with the deadly hitman, Genuine Sincere. They'll need the right location, the right gear, and the right magical protection. And then, of course, they'll need a little luck. This week on Perpetua: Sizzling Rivalry, Crashing Waves! 04 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.04] NPCs & Monsters [PNMS] Genuine Sincere [NMGNS] Traits: Cold-Blooded, Bought, Veteran. Eagle-eyed Stats: DEX 10, INS 6, MIG 8, WLP 6 Attacks: Ancient Passikan Rifle Shot, Suppressive FIRE, COLD Snap, LIGHTNING Strikes Twice, A Shot in the DARK Special Abilities: Countershot, Reinforcements, Take to the Sky (Crisis!) In-Game Description: Former colleague of Uncle Nicky. Veteran hitman in the service of.... As far as I'm concerned, this is the first real boss fight of the game, even if you're jumping between both West and East campaigns. The Kalsi fight has a potential \"hard mode,\" but you can stop it from even happening at all based on your choices. Genuine Sincere, on the other hand, will keep sniping at you until you finally fight him. (Though I am curious if the game ever forces a traditional fight with him, or if you can complete the whole campaign with him occasionally taking a potshot through your window. Anyone test this out yet?) All of that is to say: Come in prepared! First of all, keep any elemental weaknesses in mind (like Elena's weakness to bolt) because four out of the five attacks Genuine has are elemental in nature. Worse: He's the first enemy who can actively MAKE YOU WEAK to an element. He can also debuff you in a number of different ways, so bring enough IP to Tonic your way through the fight if you need to. On top of all that he's a Villain and a Champion class enemy, so even if you try to grind to beat him, he's going to end up with a lot more HP than any one of your party members. Yikes. Oh, and did I mention, he isn't even alone? He starts the fight with a Hoodlum Mechanic [NMHMC] and a Gangster Killer [NMGKL] on his side, plus a (de)Activated BuilderBot [NMABB] that can be used against you if the Mechanic can get control of it. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. Starter Tip: As far as I can tell, you have three places you can confront Genuine in the city: The clock tower where he snipes you from as you enter (and when you're in the hotel.) The beach at Rose Shore (which is definitely the hardest, because of some enemies that can join from the sea). And one of the industrial buildings in Highrail.

      "description": "After being taken under the wing of Commodore Onyx, the crew of the Little Snail were brought up to date on the situation in Calstega Bay and beyond—learning for the first time details about a larger conflict between light and dark. But soon, they'll learn just how limited the protection of this \"protective custody\" is. As Genuine Sincere begins to pull tight his snare, will Elena, Jonathan, Nicky, and Veile escape the hotel, or will they find their destiny cut short? This week on Perpetua: Sizzling Rivalry, Crashing Waves! 03 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.04] Some Feedback [Page 15 of 18] CarlsSr But anyway speaking of cooking, I feel like I run out of ingredients with Nicky too much. Is there any way to get more besides traveling? Alukard83 Wow, a useful question from Carl, I never thought I'd see the day. Shouldn't this be its own thread though? CarlsSr They don't let me make threads on the forum for some reason. TheUnforgivenIII The fact that you're having problems is just more PROOF that this faq sucks. And so does this message board, I hope the site closes. Alukard83 You could always just do easy travel in a circle right outside a city where it's safest to try to get some extra ingredients. Btw why are you always so angry Unforgiven? Must be all that Metallica you listen to. Maybe try listening to some real music for a change, like Bauhaus. Though maybe for someone like you, you should try some BEGINNER stuff, like The Cult or Nine Inch Nails! XxZelgadyskXx I don't know the answer to this one Carl, but for quick questions like this you're always welcome to come hang out on the IRC channel! We're on DALnet! Oh, and I haven't used it yet but try Nicky's. We'll even let you start new conversation topics if you want n.n;;;; TheDiamondRanger What's an IR Channel? CarlsSr It's okay guys, I decided to just give Nicky the \"Gathering\" camp skill. Seems like that will work FriendofNei Wait, Carl, don't!

      "description": "Many are the questions that run through the heads of the Little Snail's award-winning chefs as they are paraded through the streets of Calstega Bay. Some are quite philosophical: When is a victory a failure, and when might imprisonment be protection? Others are more mundane in nature: What is wrong with this Commodore, and how much trouble are we in? They will find answers to some of these questions, certainly, but some answers are only doors to new mysteries and new visions of the world… This week on Perpetua: Sizzling Rivalry, Crashing Waves! 02 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.04] NPCs & Monsters [PNMS] Hoodlum Mechanic [NMHMC] Typical Traits: Boastful, Irritable, Proud, Strong Stats: DEX 6, INS 6, MIG 10, WLP 8 Attacks: Flash Orb, Heavy Wrench Special Abilities: Field Repair, Electroswing, Bad Temper In-Game Description: Mechanic for the Calstega Bay Cheetahs. You might read \"mechanic\" and think \"brain, not brawn.\" But the Cheetah Gang's mechanics are a bit of both. They have giant, electrified wrenches and they know how to use 'em. That said, they aren't especially hard to hit, so if you're aggressive, you can knock 'em out before they get the upper handon you. Starter Tip : Make sure to take them out (or at least disable them) before you try to focus on any automatons or constructs, otherwise you'll find that the damage you do gets repaired away! Gangster Killer [NMGKL] Typical Traits: Sneaky, Perceptive, Arrogant, Fast Stats: DEX 8, INS 6, MIG 6, WLP 8 Attacks: Knife Toss, Steel Dagger Special Abilities: None In-Game Description: Cold blooded killer for the Cheetah gang.. These guys are just about the most basic enemy in the game. They do one thing: Damage. They don't have a ton of HP, they don't have a bunch of special moves or spells. They just stab you as hard as they possibly can. Starter Tip: Not much to say, except hope that you don't get dazed by their Knife Toss! Activated BuilderBot [NMABB] Typical Traits: Sneaky, Perceptive, Arrogant, Fast Stats: DEX 8, INS 6, MIG 10, WLP 6 Attacks: Hammer Smash Special Abilities: Barrier Projector In-Game Description: A Calstega Bay Construction bot that has been modified by the Cheetahs. I didn't expect robots to pop up in this game, did you!? If you let a mechanic activate them, they can become a real problem. Not only do they have a really strong melee attack (that can slow you if it hits!) but their Barrier Projector can also prevent the party from fleeing. That said, if you get lucky, you can get one for yourself and use it not only in battles against high-value monsters that flee, but also in some Adventure Field Puzzles, and even in the boss fight at the end of Calstega Bay! Starter Tip: If you can get a BuiilderBot into crisis, it gains the unique \"Exposed Core\" debuff, losing its fire and ice resistance, but also turning all of its melee damage into Bolt.

      "description": "Elena. Jonathan. Nicky. Veile. Four would-be adventurers, drawn together by circumstance yet bound by fate. At the helm of the Little Snail, they've driven full speed towards the glint of an assassin's scope, believing that sometimes, the safest place to hide from a killer is right under his nose. Whether or not it will work, this tactic has brought them to new sights, and a new city: Calstega Bay. This industrious burg was once ruled by a tyrannical limb of the Adelvys Dynasty, Grand Sonnerian royalty and masters of the Manakin, doll-like beings brought to life by powerful, clockwork magic. When the Manakin took their freedom, they turned the Duke's palace into a people's plaza, and transformed the city into a seaside sanctuary for the curious and creative. But today, the city faces a new threat. The Valte Empire. All across the world, in search of the power to halt the coming apocalypse, they have deployed their best, whether canny, competent, or cruel. Opal. Onyx. Cinnabar. Citrine. Zorite. Zircon. Alabaster. Agate. Spread across Perpetua in pairs, these marshals and commodores, these spymasters and scientists desperately seek an anti-apocalyptic solution, no matter the cost. And today, that cost is the people of Calstega Bay, newly occupied by this airborne stratocracy. Whether by iron sword or velvet glove, the Valte plunder the city, working alongside a hired killer on his own fated mission. As the crew of the Little Snail tries to maneuver through the world of politics and power, they may just end up in dark places, lit only by flashes of a fight older than this world—and perhaps, older than life itself. This week on Perpetua: Pt 1 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.04] Some Feedback [Page 14 of 18] TheDiamondRanger Is there a way to change classes in this one or is that only in the last game? FriendofNei Hey guys, sorry to derail but I really need some help on the Calstega Bay section. I have most of the big fights and everything stratted out already, but the one thing I'm struggling with is the big competition section (which you should make sure to skip if you want to do ANY shopping before things really kick off, by the way!) Is anyone able to reverse engineer how the judge calculations work? I thought it had to do with favored ingredients but I\"m not sure. Anyone have any good recipes? Also, DiamondRanger, there isn't a previous game in this series, you must be thinking of something else. TheDiamondRanger Isn't this a sequel to KosmoKairosis in the same universe? As for recipes, I know how to make a hamburger, toast, and my I learned how to make scrambled eggs last week but other than that I don't cook. Alukard83 You should try using those weird Dragon Path ingredients if you have them, I think they give bonus points? TheDiamondRanger Wait does this game have cooking in it? Alukard83 . . . . . . . . . Are you even playing the game? Nicky IS A CHEF. TheDiamondRanger I thought NIcky Dashiel was a Dark Blade/Gourmet. And no I'm not playing, because I don't have enough trade in points. I'm hoping i get it for my birthday though. TheDiamondRanger [Deleted by mods. DO NOT DOUBLE POST.] Alukard83 Are you allowed to be on this website? AND WHAT DO YOU THINK GOURMET MEANS. TheDiamondRanger I asked my dad and he says it means a really expensive meal. Alukard83 You thought Nicky was an EXPENSIVE MEAL? CarlsSr Wait, how DO you make a hamburger in Perpetua?

      "description": "Aboard the Argent Wind, Caoimhe Wake, Antistrophe Landrace, and Brontë Adelvys settle in for a peaceful journey east. But to live the life of the traveler is to dare fate, as all journeys are invitations to encounter the forgotten and the unexpected both. And for this group of adventurers, they find themselves faced with one and then the other: First, the sudden appearance of a childhood friend. Next, a rumbling of what might be amiss in the City of Iron Chains… This week on Perpetua: On Track to Iron Chains Pt. 03 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.03] Town Maps [TNMP] Cenn, City of Iron Chains [CNMP] The Ironclad Parade The creepy statues surrounding all of Cenn. Nothing happens if you walk through here when you first arrive, besides the occasional tremor. I thought there'd be ghosts to fight or something, but just these statues for now. Pilgrim's Quarter The western border of Cenn, home to hotels, campgrounds, and a general store where you can get IP and other basic items. This is where you arrive if you end up taking the train route to the city. Digsite West This used to be one of the two big dig sites in Cenn, where they were trying to pull up the weird object buried underground, plus all the strange relics and equipment they could find. That latter part is why it turned into a huge shopping zone, and once it was a shopping zone, it was also a food zone. Definitely stop in here before pushing too far in Cenn. Here's what you can buy there: Weapons Siegebreaker - 750 asta DEX + INS -【HR + 12】physical damage - Two-handed / Ranged Damage dealt by this weapon ignores Resistances. Spell Sever - 850 asta DEX + INS+1 -【HR + 4】dark - One-handed / Melee When you hit a creature with this weapon, if the attack had a single target, you may choose a single spell with a duration of Scene affecting the target and end its effects on that creature. Armor Archeologist's Boots - 900 Asta When your group makes a discovery while traveling, you may immediately gain 1 Fabula Point. Securibot Armor - martial 1250 11 Def / INS +1 Mdef / -3 initiative You have Immunity to earth and poison damage, but Vulnerability to bolt damage. Accessories Digsite Helmet - 700 Asta Grants Resistance to Physical damage. Broken after the third time physical damage is resisted. Other Strange Device - 2500 Asta Recovered from the digsite. Has a keyboard like a typewriter, attached to a darkened mirror. (I have NO idea what this is, but I bought it IMMEDIATELY) Castine's Moon The huge moon that was lifted out from the earth's crust. Only the top part of it is above ground, but that's still huge. I love when you can see it in the background! Before Caoimhe gets her mission, you can just walk on its surface and get some lore from some little shrines and the big temple in the middle. One thing I like is that Castine really does walk around it with various NPCs! It seems like it just randomly pulls in one of the other Cenn NPC models for him to hang out with. Digsite East The dig actually continues here. It's all locked down with security, probably because they're still actively digging.Travelers (and the party) have to go around. Believe it or not, you can actually do some low level grinding here! Groundbreak This is where the digging first started, and because of that it's become important to the city culturally. Both the Hexcloak office AND the City Hall are here. And PLEASE remember, you have to go to the latter to actually start the main quest here. YOUR GAME IS NOT BROKEN JUST BECAUSE THE HEXCLOAK OFFICE IS EMPTY. Seawalk Da beach. The most important thing is that you can play Beachminton here, which is a pretty stupid minigame but the prizes are great. Breeze Boulevard An elevated area filled with fancy houses. This is where the hoity-toity types of Cenn live. At first I thought this was weird, because it seems like this town shouldn't even have them, since Castine's priests seem to be the most important people. But if you talk to some of the NPCs in town, you can learn that before Castine showed up, the people who made the most money off the archeological dig (and the inventions that came out of it) got rich and wanted to live further away from (and higher up than) the dig sites. Sutcliffe Street The industrial district, where various engineers and blacksmiths and factory-runners try to reverse engineer the stuff that gets found in the digsite.

      "description": "From the roof of the restricted Hexcloak train station, Caoimhe Wake, Antistrophe Landrace, and Brontë Adelvys can hear the approach of a train. It is a train that will take them east, towards the coastline, towards Cenn, City of Iron Chains, and towards a brush with deity and destiny both. But if they are to board this train, they must first overcome a foe equal parts cryptic and cunning: The Fleggus! This week on Perpetua: On Track to Iron Chains Pt. 02 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.03] NPCs & Monsters [PNMS] Fleggus [NMFG] Typical Traits: Territorial, Cackling, Experimental Stats: DEX 6, INS 10, MIG 6, WLP 8 Attacks: Fleggus Staff, Feathershell, Chain Lightning Special Abilities: Final Act: Stoneshell In-Game Description: A green, speckled megga flegg with a black, feathery cloak, wielding a staff topped by what looks like a smaller version of its own green, speckled egg form. It's a Wizard Flegg!!! Honestly, as far as I can tell, it seems like this guy is more bark than bite. (Do Fleggs bark? Wait, do Fleggs bite?) He's a miniboss, but he doesn't have a ton of HP, and while Chain Lightning can be annoying if it hits, once you get the dazed debuff, it's not like he has a way of taking advantage of you with that. Maybe if he had more than just a pair of regular old Fleggs ot back him up. (Also: It's not clear to me if a \"megga flegg\" is a special class of Flegg or not, but it definitely makes me think that we'll be seeing more of these guys.) Starter Tip: Unlike regular Fleggs, he's weak to ICE instead of FIRE. What's up with that? Flegg [see NMFL] Conductor Chend (he/him) [NMCC] Traits: Pacifistic, Protective, Warweary Stats: ??? Attacks: Get Off My Train Spells: ??? In-Game Descriptions: Conductor of The Argent Wind, this birdkind engineer has put his past of fighting behind him. In one of the preview screenshots, this guy is CLEARLY a Dove, but in game I think he's meant to be one of the Seagulls from the western continent? Not sure why they'd change that. Starter Tip: DO NOT try to start a fight on the train. He will interrupt the fight and basically wipe your whole party! Attendant Sono (he/him) [NMSN] Traits: Enthusiastic, Modest, Acquiescent Stats: ??? Attacks: ??? Spells: ??? In-Game Descriptions: Attendant of the Argent Wind. This Lobble is something of a pushover. Not much to say about this dude. I do like how he's basically a rubber band ball though. It's probably pretty cool to be a living rubber band ball. Starter Tip: I can't confirm this, but I've heard that if you manage to pickpocket Sono, you get a free drink ticket for the dining car, and that you can do this repeatedly. If you fail, though, it starts a fight and Chend will show up and lay the smacketh down on you, so be careful!

      "description": "Drawn together by mystery, circumstance, and burgeoning camaraderie, the trio of Caoimhe Wake, Antristrophe Landrace, and Brontë Adelvys (plus the young prince's loyal servants) have already made their mark on Perpetua. The fires of Burzin have been quenched, and the town glows again under sacred light. Now they are called east, towards new mystery, old friends, and a city of Iron. To get there, they must decide: Travel the long, but safe path by foot out of the desert and into the savannah, where the high grass teems with charming life? Or rush north, across dangerous terrain, towards a restricted, Hexcloak-only train station, in hopes of catching a ride by rail to their destination: Cenn, the City of Iron Chains, whose inhabitants have spent millennia digging for clues about Perpetua's past. But they aren't the only ones traveling to Cenn: Every day, devotees of Castine, Living Metal, make their way towards the Ironclad Parade, hearts beating with emotion. Curiosity. Faith. Compassion. Awe. Anger. Fear. Pride. Love. One day, our heroes may think back on this journey to Cenn, and realize it was their last normal week, the final days before their lives changed forever, one more simple quest before they'd need to face new truths, before fated confrontations with hated rivals, eternal beings, and the only member of the Ennead who chooses to walk amongst his people. So gather round, and listen, as they step out beyond the little town where you first met them and, if they can catch their train on time, take their first strides… towards destiny. This week on Perpetua: Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.03] - Some Feedback [Page 08 of 11] TheUnforgivenIII GO BACK AND REREAD MY POST, UNLESS THAT'S TOO HARD FOR YOU. BECAUSE THAT ISN'T WHAT I SAID AT ALL. HERE, I'LL QUOTE THE SIXTH PARAGRAPH, SO THAT YOUR LAZY ASS DOENS'T NEED TO HIT THE FCKNGI BACK BUTTON! > And like I said before, that's because you took too long to get there. If you actually take it seriously and get there quickly, you don't get into any fights and you just get all the loot for free. Definitely the best way to do it. GET IT NOW? Alukard83 No I don't \"get it' because there's nothing to be \"gotten.\" Maybe YOU should go back and re-read the Walkthrough, because FoN lays it all out in the loot table. Don't worry, I'll wait, I'm patient. CarlsSr l o l appeal to authority much? Alukard83 That's not an appeal to authority! I'm telling you where you can go get the answer for yourself! If you had read the guide, you would know what the guide said! CarlSr begging the question XD WolfOConner Is this forum always like this or did I just come on a bad day? Anyway, I'm saved right before leaving Burzin, so what exactly should I do? XxZelgadyskXx Wolf, don't leave! We need more good posters! (Love your StarFox guide by the way!) Anyway, I'm not up to date on the guide, but my little brother lost my save file so i had to personally replay the whole game through this point over the weekend, and I think I can give some insight. Unforgiven is right that if you get to Springsong fast enough, there's no fight at all, and all the environmental loot is just there waiting for you to find it. But that's only the ENVIRONMENTAL LOOT, the chests, the fishing point, and the little interactable points. What you lose out on getting is anything from the enemies that would be here if you took too long. You can steal from them, and the boss has something that is (so far) totally unique in the game. So yes, you CAN get loot without any risk by going fast, but you miss out on the rewards from the fight (plus anything you can steal from the boss, if you took the Soul Steal ability from Rogue.) FriendofNei Haha whoops, didn't mean to cause all this chaos guys! Zel is totally right, and I thought I was making that clear with the loot tables attached to the fights. I'll be sure to make a note in the area description if this happens again! Btw, does anyone understand why the fight only happens if you take a longer time to get there? Shouldn't getting there first mean that it's still an unpurified echo or whatever?

      "description": "With Redolencia behind them and a new friend on board, the crew of the Little Snail powers forward towards Calstega Bay. Unfortunately, as a familiar crack sounds in the distance, they find that the home of the Manakin is less welcoming than they'd hoped! Now, the ad hoc adventurers must find their way past the blockades and between the sniper's bullets if they hope to make it into the seaside town. This week on Perpetua: Journey to the Bay Pt. 03 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.03] Town Maps [TNMP] Calstega Bay [CBMP] While smaller towns and villages are set up in a single, scrolling screen, larger cities like Calstega Bay are broken up into different \"district\" zones. Each one has a bunch of stuff in it, so for the sake of speed (this is an IN PROGRESS FAQ after all!) I'm going to just list the basics and I'll come back later if more detail is needed. Anyway, without further to do: Northcrook A.K.A. \"Crookville,\" this is the primary way of entering during the opening scenario. There's a hospital here (with a doctor who has some very funny dialog). You can grind here for a little bit against both Valtese Guards and \"Cheetahs.\" (They're not Cheetahs, they're Manakin Gang Members that have Cheetah Spots on them. I don't know that the developers know what gangs are like in real life.). The Free Quarter This is the big central square of town that connects most of the other districts to one another. So you know what that means: You'll be running through it CONSTANTLY, especially after you get the disguise and the pass that let you move around freely. You can also go into the palace to learn some lore about the Manakin and Grand Sonnerie and the noble who used to rule here. And the clocktower at the top of the palace is the first of three places you can choose to have the big boss fight at at the end of the main quest chapter here! Westgate Markets This is where the big cooking competition happens, technically, but let me just focus on what you care about most here. The GEAR! Here's what's available: Weapons Inventor's Screwdriver - 600 asta DEX+DEX+1 - [HR+4] physical - 1 handed / melee Damage dealt by this weapon ignores Resistances. Inventor's Hammer - 800 Asta MIG+MIG - [HR+10] bolt damage - 2 handed / melee Do an extra 5 damage to Constructs. Gatling Crossbow - 1350 asta, martial DEX+INS - [HR+12] physical damage - 2 handed Attacks with this weapon always have multi (2) Encyclopedia - 600 asta INS+INS - [HR+6] physical - two handed / melee You are immune to dazed. Armor Inventor's Garb - 800 asta DEX die +1 Def / INS die +1 Mdef/ -1 Init You gain +1 IP maximum. Bandit Jacket - 900 asta DEX die +1 Def / INS die +1 Mdef /-1 Initiative You gain +1 bonus to Accuracy Checks with Daggers. Cheetah Jacket - 650 asta, martial 10 Def / INS die +1 MDef/ +2 Initiative Automaton Suit - 1250 asta, martial 11 Def / INS die +1 MDef / -3 Init You have Immunity to Earth and Poison Damage, but vulnerability to bolt damage. Inventor's Shield - 1600 asta +2 Def You have immunity to bolt damage. Accessories Springloaded Boots - 1200 asta Spend 3IP to launch yourself into the air, allowing you to attack a single flying enemy with a melee attack, or giving you a +2 on an appropriate skill check. Inventor's Gloves - 500 asta You are immune to shaken Sharpshooter's Lenses - 1000 asta You gain a +1 bonus to your Accuracy Checks. Cornergate This is one of the main ways in/out of the town after you complete the main quest stuff here. There are a handful of random encounters here, but nowhere near as many as in Crookville. It's sort of just a weird corner of the city with nothing going on besides the gate. I don't know why it got its own zone. Maybe I'm missing something. Highrail This is where the train to the north comes. You'll walk past this place a BUNCH and go \"why can't I just get on a train and get out of here.\" BE PATIENT! It's also a great place to grind, especially against the modified Loader Bots. The second of three places you could have the boss fight at, depending on your dialog options. Night Docks I haven't been able to get into this place yet except for the cutscene where you go to the nearby hotel. It gets closed off after that. But before you go, definitely make sure to buy up as much IP as you can. Atelier Road This is what I'd call the \"fancy shop\" part of town. Later on in the game you can get mage equipment here plus some pretty good accessories, but for now it seems to be locked off by the Valtean Empire and the locals having staredowns. Roseshore Despite all the signage warning about a sea monster, this is the fancy beach of the town. It's also the third possible boss fight location—I wonder if the monster gets involved with the fight if you have it there instead of the other places?

      "description": "Led by the cries of someone in danger, the crew of the Little Snail have charged into the Celestial Echo of Redolencia, an otherworldly swampland where magic works differently and shadowy creatures flit between trees. The source of those screams was a Manakin scholar who'd wandered too far into the Echo and who now found himself face-to-face with a maneating orchid. Can these humble adventurers, still recovering from their own recent stumbles into danger, save this wandering researcher before he becomes plantfood?, This week on Perpetua: Perpetua 09: Journey to the Bay Pt. 01 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.03] Ongoing Mysteries - Ancient Passikan Megadungeons [OMMD] I haven't actually been to any of these yet, but if you're able to get a perfect result on the big Redolencia puzzle, these all get marked on your map. What's really weird is that if you have a separate East campaign save going at the same time, they get marked on that save's map too! In any case, I don't know specifics about them as dungeons yet (or even if you actually go to each of these in this game), but here's some bullet points on what I DO know some details about them based on the Prelude, item descriptions, and other world exploration I've done. So I've collected those details here. The Hanging Gardens of Rillspur This is obviously where Elena is from. Towards the center of the western continent (aka Tidaline). Three rivers run out of it, west, east, and south. In the Prelude, Harlow went here and met some people in the \"pleasure gardens\" and maybe saved a kid's life, it wasn't really clear during the vignette. She's referenced it having a ton of floors in dialog, and the top floors are easy and her family runs a restaurant there. It's a water dungeon (or an ice dungeon?), really not clear, especially after Redolencia's revelations about the Ennead. The Passikan people/creatures there water (or ice?) magic while inside. There are some sort of magical mosaics. Milsource, Fallen Capital Was the capital of a huge empire on the eastern continent before the rise of the Elevana League and the Hundred Burroughs. Apparently a really important river used to run out of here but it all dried up, or somehow \"left\" the capital? And that was the beginning of a huge downturn in the empire. If this is the place that Glesi and Yukai's culture was originally from (or near) in the Prelude, Maybe the place where Sourcerot, the curse that the Eastern party is investigating, is from. Definitely what it's named for. Duriel, The Splintered Colosseum In the Holy Protectorate of Placidia, which is the area north of the mountains on Tidaline. But it ISN'T the capital of that place, which is a city called Verus. Also came up during the Prelude. Harlow went here and saw a bunch of people acting out conflicts between various gods and spirits and ancient heroes? There wasn't really any clear structure that looked like a dungeon there, though. Very close to the the Addled Shore, which was like some sort of major fog monster? Not Clear!!! The Gleaming Fortress, Lumai One of the major city-states of the Elevana League. West of the big mountain range there. Presumably tied to the Light-blessed Elves and/or Lucena. Right on the big river that runs down the whole continent in like a boomerang shape. Mysterious Southern Continent The icon for the dungeon is dead in the middle of the southern continent. We don't know jack diddly squat about this place. Not the name, not who lives there, not what sort of weapons they have, nothing. All we know from the demo is that they grow some sort of special flower or something near the \"Capnae Mountains,\" but they're all the way in the northwest and far from the dungeon icon.

      "description": "The humble crew of the LIttle Snail could not have known what they were getting into. A simple, kindness had led them towards danger and mystery unknwon. A fallen tower. Undead dragon cultists descending on them in the dark. An ancient prophecy written by the light. And a sanctimonious solivagant stolen into shadow Yet faced with this chaos, they continued. Making their way north, first to the bridge they'd rebuilt only days ago and then turning towards the seaside city of Calstega Bay in search fo answers. All around them, Perpetua awed with its beauty. The sea breeze sweeping across Tidaline's plains. Life all around them, blossoming and chirping. And the daytime sky giving way to the stars. And so they were on the cusp of unexpected discovery: Because though they did not know yet, what we do about the Stars, they would soon find out just how they echo…. Redolencia. Alteros. Ichoria. Springsong. Armidirge. Imago. Genesika. KosmoKairosis. It would be the first of these—Redolencia, announcing itself with buzzes and yelps—that they would encounter on that journey to Calstega Bay. On its face, it may have seemed like a distraction from their primary task—but in truth, it was their first glimpse into a world beyond—or a world before—the Perpetua they knew. A lesson here, for those who study their journey: It is only a fool that sticks to the charted course. One never knows when a hill is worth the climb, a dance is worth a stumble, or a rose is worth its thorns. This week on Perpetua: Journey to the Bay Pt. 1 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.03] Celestial Echoes [CECH] So far, Celestial Echoes seems like they're a series of side quests, but I have a feeling they're actually really important—like either late in the campaign you'll have to go around to do all of them or else maybe the true ending is locked behind doing them? In any case, they come in two versions: Unstable and Stable. Both are a part of the map affected by \"Celestial Laws,\" which change some basic gameplay rules in BIG ways. What separates them, then? Well, Unstable Echoes are normally mini-dungeons or miniboss fights, while Stable Echoes (which you can make by completing the \"Ritual of Stellar Restoration\" in an Unstable Echo), tend to just be lore-focused map locations. Both offer a lot of unique loot, plus unique music and character interactions! Oh, also, supposedly if you don't do the ritual, Unstable Echoes can \"spread\" across more of the map, but I haven't tried to let that happen during this first playthrough (obviously). While I'm including the basic stat blocks for all the Celestial Echo enemies, NPCs, and bosses in the NPC & Monsters section (search for PNMS but with brackets around it!), I'm keeping their longer entries here because I think most people will turn here to learn about the Echoes! Redolencia [CERD] Redolencia is probably the first celestial echo you'll find (though you could go around it and reach Capstone from the Prelude if you were willing to grind a little). As such, it's got a mix of combat (a pretty cool boss fight) and dungeon/puzzle gameplay. And its Celestial Laws are pretty basic. It's sort of like playing a game with wayyy less focus on spells. The level and enemy design here is so weird It's like someone swapped the game palette with a sicker one. All the colors are like *too* colorful, but also too dim? I don't know anything about art, I just know it feels weird. And the music is SO intense given that it's just a bunch of flowers and bugs. Anyway, here's what you've got in store: Celestial Law: Alchemical Tilt: Spells heal half damage. Skills and Items heal twice as much. Celestial Law: Unstable Magic: When casting a spell, you fumble when 1s or 2s are rolled as a pair (i.e. rolls of 2 or 4, but not 1+2 or 2+1) Scalewings [NMSCW] Typical Traits: fluttering, territorial, lover of beauty, scientific Stats: DEX 10, INS 8, MIG 8, WLP 6 Attacks: Beetlehorn Spear Special Abilities: Scale Shower, Flying In-Game Description: An echo of a butterfly-like person, attendant to the Vampire Orchid. Flutters like a stuttering shadow. They're more like colorful moths than butterflies, in this FAQ-writer's opinion. They have big gross wings, and can spread poison with their Scale Shower ability. I'd love to know what the rest of their world was like, given that they use a huge beetle horn as a spear! Do you think the whole world was smaller or that everything small on it was bigger? Did humans even exist there? Starter Tip: Simple! Use fire! Vampire Orchid [NMVOR] Typical Traits: Rapacious, Hungry, Gorgeous, Fragrant Stats: DEX 8, INS 6, MIG 10, WLP 8 Attacks: Vine Drain, Pollen Dusting Special Abilities: Plant: The Vampire Orchid is immune to dazed, enraged, and shaken. In-Game Description: Tendrils of green, petals of black and yellow, and a column of deep red. Though one might wonder where the latter color comes from. A giant hungry plant—where have I seen that one before! On one hand, its weakness to both ice and fire means that your party should be able to do great damage to it! On the other hand, the Celestial Echo that increases the chance of spellcasting fumbles means that it's easier to have things go totally off the rails all at once. Starter Tip: Remember: Elemental Shards don't require any sort of spell casting roll! A cheap way to get a TON of damage during this fight.

      "description": "Why has Burzin been burning? All the clues point back to one place: Lady Teribald's House of Chance. If they're going to solve this mystery—and find out if it's connected to the greater afflictions of the continent—the investigation team must find their way past the gambling hall's many distractions and to Teribald's office in search of answers. And then there will simply be the matter of a final confrontation… This week on Perpetua: The Flames of Burzin Pt. 4 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.02] NPCs & Monsters [PNMS] Kalsi's Lantern [NMKLN] Typical Traits: Glowing, Inconspicuous, Magical Stats: DEX 8, INS 8, MIG 6, WLP 10 Attacks : Flicker Shot Special Abilities : Burn Out In-Game Description : Paper lamps filled with the lively fire of a forgotten god. Also known as \"Mysterious Lanterns\" before you get deep into the main quest in Burzin, these are super easy to grind against . Sure, Burn Out means that your whole party takes 10 damage every time you kill one, but that's still way less damage than you'd potentially get in a longer fight against some other low level monsters. Starter Tip: They're one of the only enemies that are straight up WEAK to regular physical damage! Kind of obvious, but this IS labeled \"starter tip\" after all. Mr. Crumb [NMCRM] Traits: Loyal, Gullible Stats : DEX 10, INS 8, MIG 6, WLP 8 Attacks : Jab, Revolver Blast, Quickshot (Reaction), Special Abilities : Elemental Bullet, Deadeye In-Game Description : Lady Teribald's loyal henchman. A crackshot with his elemental revolver. Mr. Crumb and Mr. Crust (below) are obviously designed to complement one another. Crust is the close up combatant, which makes Crumb the long ranged sniper. (Can you be a sniper if you just have a revolver?) That said, if you do get into his face, his counterattacks will make you pay for it… unless you've got a high defense score! My advice: Send Antistrophe in there and count on his ability to avoid incoming damage! Starter Tip : Don't worry too much about his Elemental Bullet attack. It's so unlikely that the magical damage he happens to hit is going to be important to you. But it might be worth grabbing his gun after the fight before you leave the scene and it despawns! Mr. Crust [NMCRU] Traits : Cocky, Brutal, Great Smile Stats : DEX 8, INS 6, MIG 12, WLP 6 Attacks : Wide Swing, Croupier's Rake Special Abilities : Bodyguard (Reaction), Improved Defenses, Improved HP In-Game Description : Lady Teribald's personal bodyguard. He's died for her before. Crust is the designed to look like the heavy hitter in the fight, but mostly he's the \"hard to hit\"-er. He's got better physical defense than an Embear and the same magical defense as a Flarie, so if you get a stroke of bad luck, you might end up missing him a bunch. But, because of his bodyguard ability, you're gonna just have to power through, because it's not like you can ignore him! Starter Tip: If you give him the Slow status effect, it drops his defense score by 2, which makes this fight so much easier! Kalsi, Lantern's Flame [NMKLF] Traits : Furious, Bright, Lonely Stats : DEX 6, INS 6, MIG 10, WLP 10 Attacks : Flaming Smash, Flameburst Special Abilities : Lantern's Light, Lantern's Heat, Flying In-Game Description : Forgotten God who once called Burzin his home. Led astray. Okay, the way I beat this fight means I only briefly had to contend with Kalsi directly. But if you try to fight him straight up, it's gonna be tough! He's a Champion class enemy, so he's got a TON of HP, and not only is he immune to Fire and Poison, but by default he has no elemental weaknesses, and he's flying, so you can't melee attack him. Yowch! Talk about a GOD. Starter Tip : The best way to beat Kalsi is to not have to fight him directly in the first place! The \"Objective\" move is SO powerful in this game, I wish more Roleplaying Games had something like it! Lady Teribald [NMLTB] Traits : ??? Stats : DEX ??, INS ??, MIG ??, WLP ?? Attacks : ??? Special Abilities : Mysterious Necklace In-Game Description : Drawn into a tragic fate by an alluring, otherworldly power. Teribald sucks so bad! I hate her so much, and what's worse is I can't figure out how to ACTUALLY FIGHT HER. Every time I run the fight, I have to either take too long to beat Crust and Crumb (so Kalsi emerges, and the fight is with him instead) OR I win via Objective and the fight with her never happens! If I could take Crust and Crumb out quicker, maybe I could get to go against her? Does anyone know if she has any unique loot? Starter Tip : No idea!

      "description": "Caoimhe, Antistrophe, Brontë arrived to Burzin with a clear goal: Find out whether the catastrophe in Burzin is tied to the mysterious malediction known only as Sourcerot. But seeing the town in ashes makes another objective clear: Stopping the fires from continuing, no matter what is causing them. Now, they seek answers that will lead them to investigate not only into the town's history, but into the lives of some of its oldest residents… This week on Perpetua: The Flames of Burzin Pt. 03 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.02] Town Maps [TNMP] Burzin Main Scenario Teribald's House of Chance This is where the main story route I took kicked off, but it's also where I lost a TON of asta. Wurdzin doesn't make any sense to me, but if you can get a lucky streak with your guesses, I guess you could really break the game economy here! House M'Shalia LOTS of lore here. There are way more things in the upstairs rooms and attics that you interact with than you might think. Make sure to turn on the option that makes interactables shiny! House of Benediction Obviously this is where the big showdown is, but did you know that if you go here during the day time you can get healed, get your debuffs cleansed, and get a buff! Town Hall & Jail & House Burzin I think you can advance through the main plot here instead of through the House of Chance/M'Shalia route, but I haven't had a chance to load my old save and try it yet. Let me know on the forum and I'l update this! Burned Down Buildings You can check for clues at each of these locations, but the most important one is in the southwest. That's where the Saloon burned down. Shops Mining Supplies This is basically a \"tool store\" from other towns, so if you need any consumables from those, you can get them here. Clean Water Lodge & Crebbs Potions & Poultices I listed these together because they share the same interior on screen, just with a door between the two front desks. You get to stay here for free as long as the main story is ongoing (assuming you rescued Frenk), so make sure to use it before you leave town. The next time you come back, he'll charge you!. Wilfer's Wits and Weaponry If you happen to have the asta, there are some pretty great weapons here! The Solium Bow (Dex+Dex, HR+8 Fire Damage, gives you Resistance to Fire) is especially great! Also, if you interact with the third bookcase three times, you can find \"An Accounting of Spiritual Matters,\" which gives you a huge bonus when fighting the boss here, plus can be used afterwards as a mage weapon. Serah's Surcoats I think the flame resistant armor is overpriced, but the Sungleam Shield is GREAT for Antistrophe. It's a big upgrade for both of his defenses, plus you can basically give people a solar flare from DBZ XD Side Quests / Other Residential District Mostly just NPCs to talk to about things here. I love the two brothers who hate each other. First Bank of Burzin Always remember to deposit any extra asta you have into the bank. Not only will it prevent you from losing some if you die in combat, it also actually slowly gains in value! I guess they have interest in Perpetua! Post Office This probably deserves its whole own entry, but did you know that if you have both East and West saves, you can actually transfer items between them? You just choose the \"Send a Gift to a Random Person\" option and pay the fee. The \"random person\" is actually a character in your other save game! It does take a little while to get there though. Abandoned Buildings Just a good place to grind against lanterns!

      "description": "Hexcloak justiciar Caoimhe Wake and her two ad hoc assistant investigators, Antistrophe Landrace and Brontë Adelvys, have their work cut out for them. First and foremost, there's the matter of these strange, flaming creatures attacking a traveling Lobble and his stagecoach full of supplies. And then there's there's the matter of Burzin, the small desert township on the horizon. After generations of simplicity and stability, the town has faced a sudden wave of inexplicable destruction as a phenomenon that can only be described as \"invisible fire\" has razed much of the town to ash. Will Caoimhe, Antistrophe, and Brontë find who—or what—is behind the blaze? Or will what remains of Burzin soon be burned away? This week on Perpetua: The Flames of Burzin Pt. 2 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.02] NPCs & Monsters [PNMS] Flarie [NMFLR] Typical Traits: Curious, Fickle, Scornful, Superior Stats: DEX 8, INS 10, MIG 6, WLP 8 Attacks: Flame Dart Special Abilities: Flying, Crisis: Wildfire In-Game Description: A devious flying flame, vaguely int he shape of a fairy. Flaries are cute, but they're also dangerous, especially early on! They're ranged attackers who hover just out of melee reach, so you'll need to either hit crit them or get them down to half health with ranged or magic attacks, or hit their elemental weakness. And remember, Perpetua doesn't have water magic for some reason, and Fire often Melts Ice! Any guesses on what that leaves as a natural vulnerability? That's right: EARTH. Toss some dirt on these little jerks and you'll bring 'em down to ground level. Starter Tip: Get ready to heal once you knock them into crisis! Their Wildfire move is devastating! Embear [NMEMB] Typical Traits: Pround, Hungry, Scorching, Territorial Stats: DEX 8, INS 8, MIG 10, WLP 6 Attacks: Flame Claw Special Abilities: Burn Back (Reaction) In-Game Description: A large, ursine figure of fire looking for something to eat. These guys are the brawn to the Flaries'... well, not quite brains, but fla(i)r, I guess? At the start of the game, they really pack a wallop, so try to keep your weaker characters away from their Flame Claw strikes. I wonder what type of bear they're supposed to be? Do any bears really live in the dessert??? Starter Tip: At first blush, their Burn Back reaction attack seems totally broken. But remember, it only hits melee attackers! Aisling Revanj (she/her) [NMAR] Traits: Ambitious, Mean Spirited, Envious, Loyal Stats: ??? Attacks: ??? Spells: ??? In-Game Descriptions: Fiery Hexcloak who oversees Burzin and the surrounding region. When I first saw concept art of her during previous, I thought she'd be one of my favorite characters, but it turns out that she's an ABSOLUTE B**! She's so superior and \"holier-than-thou,\" if that's the right phrase. And it's not like she solves ANYTHING, she's just always getting int he way. I cannot WAIT to fight her later on in the game. Starter Tip: You can basically button through all of her dialog, she doesn't say anything important IMO!

      "description": "For millennia, the eastern continent of Perpetua was ruled by a sprawling empire centered on the capital city of Milsource, where a living river sprung from nothing, and flowed to all the edges of the land. The empire's reach followed the running water, stretching north across the territory of the clannish Elevana and south, where the empire put leash to the fractious burroughs. It was a time of Tyranny.. But one day, a thousand years ago, the river was mysteriously pulled away into the sea, leaving the empire as dry and cracked as the riverbeds it left behind. Soon, it passed into dust, and the future opened wide with possibility. In the south, the once-squabbling burroughs found themselves re-aligned towards freedom—a state they guaranteed bywith their impressive magic. And in the north, the once quarrelsome elven clans forged themselves into a powerful coalition of independent city states… By now, you have heard of Salix, the Balming Willow, home to adventurer Arley Bates… but do you know the rest of the Elevana League? Cenn, City of Iron Chains. Lumai, the Gleaming Fortress. Glaishora, Frosted Port Town. Billough, the Floating Isle. Fulmin, Storm-brushed Bay. Marl, Bustling Mountain Pass. Parisolia, Sun Scorched Mine. Shadow-Spired Umbexia. It is here, in the Elevana League, that our second group of heroes takes the stage. A wizard of the boroughs, drained of his magic. A rakish princeling far from home. And an arcane investigator who cares more for justice than peace. Hiking down the hills days south of Parisolia, towards a little town in the brush, where they've heard rumor that an entropic curse called Sourcerot has taken hold. Whether it's empty talk, a mundane threat to people's lives, or a grand premonition of Perpetua's end, they may be the only ones able or willing to confront it. This week on Perpetua: Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.02] Playable Characters - Eastern Scenario [PPCE] Antistrophe Landrace (he/him) [ALPC] Identity: Troubled, eccentric career pathfinder Theme: Doubt Origin: One of The Hundred Burroughs Classes: Guardian, Loremaster, Tinkerer Stats: DEX 6, INS 8, MIG 10, WLP 8 At the start of the game, Antistrophe is exactly what he looks like: A Huge Walking Fortress. With two shields and a ton of HP, he's going to be the guy you want taking hits for your team. He's ultra resilient and believe it or not, his high Might means that he can really do damage with those shields too! He also has a ton of utility in investigation scenes! Starter Tip: Antistrophe's Potion Rain ability is really random BUT it can give you effects that you cannot get from regular consumables from shops. If there's nothing to do (and no one needs to be defended that round) give it a shot! Brontë Adelvys (he/him) [BAPC] Identity: Dissipated Sixth Scion of the First Line Theme: Scintillation Origin: Terroir, Grande Sonnerie Classes: Sharpshooter, Rogue, Dancer Stats: DEX 10, INS 8, MIG 6, WLP 8 Brontë is a huge horndog, but he's also super powerful in combat. It's not just the ranged damage he does, and it's not even the bonus attacks he can get off, it's also all the negative status effects he can apply! In Perpetua, status effects are really powerful because of how they lower stats directly. Once you get over his quips and flirtations, you'll fall for his combat power. Plus he starts with a TON of extra asta. Starter Tip: Brontë isn't anywhere as tough as Antistrophe, BUT he does have a pair of cute bodyguards who can take hits for him. So he can be your defender in a pinch! Caoimhe Wake (she/her) [CWPC] Identity: Caoimhe Wake Theme: Doubt Origin: Billough, the Floating Isle Classes: Elementalist, Weaponmaster Stats: DEX 10, INS 8, MIG 6, WLP 8 Caoimhe (pronounced KEE-VAH, apparently) definitely feels like THE main character of the Eastern campaign. Not just because she's a badass Justiciar, but also because she's the classic Spellsword archetype that everyone loves. (I'm guilty too!) She's the party's main source of elemental damage, so definitely consider expanding her magical repertoire as you get her leveled up! Starter Tip: Ventus is an incredible spell, not least of all because it can hit flying targets and on a critical hit, ground them (allowing Caoimhe to follow up with melee attacks before they can get flying again!)

      "description": "In the ruins of a fallen tower, the crew of the Little Snail found themselves (and their egos) battered and bruised. Worse, Elena, Veile, and Nicky found themselves missing one ingredient to the special stew that was their group: Jonathan! Where had he been taken? And could it, perhaps, lead them towards the eternal flame which they were sent to retrieve? This week on Perpetua: The Shadow of the Dragon Tower Pt. 4 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.01] - Some Feedback [Page 01 of 03] Alukard83 Hey, this FAQ rules! Normally I buy the official guide but they want FIFTY dollars for this one, and I just don't have that sorta cash right now, so this is a lifesaver. HOWEVER, your map on the final puzzle area in the Dragon Tower isn't right at ALL. Not sure what you were on when you made it, but it's totally wrong. Otherwise, keep up the good work XD TheUnforgivenIII Yeah I was coming here to post the same thing. This guide sucks bigtime. In my opinion, it's PROOF you should not be releasing this guide without finishing the full game first, because you're going to be in such a hurry that you're going to make stupid mistakes like this (or maybe even make things up entirely, which is my guess.) Take the FAQ down because it doesn't have any REAL answers in it. CarlsSr That's not what OP said, Unforgiveniii. Your bias is showing. FriendOfNei Thanks for the kudos Alukard, but listen, I loaded the save FIVE TIMES and checked it again and again and it's right. I don't know what YOU'RE on but maybe you're the one who is mistaken. As for you, Unforgiven, you're not even worth my keystrokes. XxZelgadyskXx I'm not OP or the FAQ writer but we did some testing over in the IRC channel it turns out that the bomb placement is RANDOMIZED for every player. So the FAQ isn't *wrong* it's just not right for anyone except for Nei. n.n;;;; Hosted by Austin Walker ( austinwalker.bsky.social ) Featuring Ali Acampora ( ali-online.bsky.social ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( amtebbel.bsky.social ), Jack de Quidt ( notquitereal.bsky.social ), and Andrew Lee Swan ( swandre3000.bsky.social ) Produced by Ali Acampora Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Cover Art by Ben McEntee ( https://linktr.ee/benmce.art ) With thanks to Amelia Renee, Arthur B., Aster Maragos, Bill Kaszubski, Cassie Jones, Clark, DB, Daniel Laloggia, Diana Crowley, Edwin Adelsberger, Emrys, Greg Cobb, Ian O'Dea, Ian Urbina, Irina A., Jack Shirai, Jake Strang, Katie Diekhaus, Ken George, Konisforce, Kristina Harris Esq, L Tantivy, Lawson Coleman, Mark Conner, Mike & Ruby, Muna A, Nat Knight, Olive Perry, Quinn Pollock, Robert Lasica, Shawn Drape, Shawn Hall, Summer Rose, TeganEden, Thomas Whitney, Voi, chocoube, deepFlaw, fen, & weakmint This episode was made with support from listeners like you!

      "description": "\"Oh, how did we get here!?\" That's what the staff of the Little Snail Food Truck might be wondering. After all, just a week ago, they were living the good life: traveling from town to town, seeing the sights, and serving delicious, memory-making meals. Now where are they? The depths (or heights?) of a ruined Dragon Tower? Separated in the dark? Confounded by its hallways and stairwells? Was this what people meant when they said 'adventure'? This week on Perpetua: The Shadow of the Dragon Tower Pt. 3 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.01] Dragon Tower Map (IN PROGRESS) [PMDT] I'm going to try to save most of the maps until I get the text done, but I wanted to put at least this starter one in so I could start getting feedback. (Dotted lines are secret hallways/doors.) There are 10 rooms in the Dragon Tower dungeon, eight main ones and two secret side rooms. Entry Hall [DTEH] You obviously can't skip the first room of the dungeon, but it's pretty straight forward. There's an optional boss fight here (see [NMCH]), and you can get some lore about what happened here. I think it's connected to the events from the Prelude (this is the same tower, if you didn't notice) but I'm not 100% sure yet. Downward Stairwell [DTDS] Technically this is an upward stairwell that goes downward, but whatever, that's what it says it's called on the save game file. This is again pretty straight forward, so I won't bother spelling out which platforms and stairs to jump between Squire Training Hall [DTTH] There's a chance to encounter a Dragon Squire here, but depending on how you enter, it's normally just filled with little bits of loot and some clues for solving puzzles (both in the dungeon and later in the game, from what I can tell). Scryer Library [DTSL] There are a bunch of books you can interact with here to get some lore about the world, though a few of them are written in weird runes. You can also aggro a Scryer here. She's not as tough as Chelik, but can still give early parties some trouble, so be careful!. Magic characters can find some early gear upgrades here. Plus, check the eastern wall for a secret passageway to… Magic Pantry [DTMP] This is sort of a \"rest stop\" or \"check point\" in the dungeon. Everyone gets +1 IP and chefs can find rare ingredients. It's a bit of a schlep to get here if you chose the western route through the dungeon, but definitely worth it! Observation Deck [DTOD] Some more jumping puzzles, one of which has a kind of brutal timer. But there's potentially a really interesting cutscene with BIG implications here. I'll leave you to see if you can figure it out. Flaming Tunnel Tunnel [DTFT] Trying to pass through this place without having at LEAST fire resistance on your whole party is extremely risky. I haven't figured out how to get through here without taking any damage, so I much prefer going through the Observation Deck to get to the final part of the dungeon. BUT you can get access to the Squire Armory through here. Squire Armory [DTSA] There is a real tough physical enemy type in here (I'll post the stats on them later), and it shouldn't be too hard—at least if you're not facing it alone. But make sure to heal up before you come in, and be extra careful about dragging in mobs from elsewhere in the dungeon. Make sure to poke around this place for some gear upgrades for your melee damage dealers! Shimmering Ruins [DTSR] You'll find out first hand what the \"shimmering\" in this room is via a cutscene when you first enter it. My advice is that if you don't have someone with very high Insight or some Tinker abilities, do not try to interact with the objects. Eternal Flame [DTEF] This is technically the end of the dungeon (though you can obviously still explore if you want to). I won't get too deep into spoilers, but there's a cutscene that will play when you get here, AND (thanks to DragonFang86 on the forum) we know that if you rush to the end quickly, you can actually get an early encounter with one of the villains that's all over all the ads for the game! I bet you could even fight her, if you move fast enough, but no one's done it yet.

      "description": "The crew of the Little Snail, traveling food truck and makeshift HQ for this band of equally makeshift adventurers, has agreed to escort a young priestess named Veile to a mysterious destination. Within days, they met their first obstacle: a group of mischievous Fleggs who've vandalized the Little Snail and sabotaged the way forward… This week on Perpetua: The Shadow of the Dragon Tower Pt. 02 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.01] NPCs & Monsters [PNMS] Flegg [NMFL] Typical Traits: Mischievous, Anxious, Clever, Family Oriented Stats: DEX 8, INS 8, MIG 8, WLP 8 Attacks: Flegg Strike, Infuriate, Flegg Blast Special Abilities: Final Act: Stoneshell In-Game Description: A living egg. It comes up to your shins. It has a beak!? These guys must be a little different than they were in the demo, because they definitely didn't have the ability to turn into a stone when you killed them in Prelude. I wonder if something happened to them between the game or if the designers just rebalanced them? Anyway, they're a basic enemy type, pretty good for grinding, but don't underestimate how they can overwhelm you in a group. Starter Tip: Even though they're \"monsters\" you can actually try to use Persuasion on them! Vinnor Jekk (he/him) [NMVJ] Traits: Devoted, Optimistic, Pedantic, Arrogant Stats: ??? Attacks: ??? Spells: ??? In-Game Description: Solivigant of the Way of Fearless Truth who seeks to enact a world-saving prophecy. I can't tell what I think about this guy. Either he's going to betray the party and become a mid-game boss or he's just one of those guys you hate to talk to even though he's technically right about everything. No clue about stats/attacks/spells (because let's be real, this guy DEFINITELY has spells). Starter Tip: Depending on your dialog choices you can get a chance to snoop through his stuff to get more lore. Chelik, Awakened Dragon Watcher (she/her) [NMCH] Traits: Wise, Focused, Out-of-Her-Time, Melancholy Stats: DEX 6, INS 10, MIG 6, WLP 10 Attacks: Elemental Charge Spells: Ice Beam, Flame Breath In-Game Description: Recently revived scryer of the Dragon Watchers. I can't stress this enough: Chelik is an optional boss. Unless you have done a bunch of grinding, she's probably out of your range when you first meet her. Yes, you can get some really decent gear if you manage to knock her out, but I think it's probably worth trying to avoid the fight all together (or else use the Persuade command to try to escape it). Starter Tip: If she's using Elemental Charge, that means she's low on MP and you can probably push the advantage a little!

      "description": "Bastion Blaque, battle-hardened ranger and erstwhile captain of the Sonnerian royal guard. Canary Shye, Placid Guardian and master of the Cyclic Hand School of Combat. Quarter Tomm, high arcanist of the hundred burroughs and virtuoso conductor of the elements.Powerful alone, together they were the famed adventurers known as the IRON TRIGON. Which is why, Vinnor Jekk, heterodox cleric of the Way of Fearless Truth hired them when he needed protection for his would-be-protege, the girl of prophecy. Setting out from Verus, capital of the Holy Protectorate, they eschewed train and carriage, traveling surreptitiously across the savannah, hidden in mountains' shadow, towards the seaside village of Salann where their wide-eyed charge awaited And as they learned, with ward in tow, she was not alone in awaiting them. Just halfway to their destination, in moonbright night, AMBUSH. Exhaustion. Blinding light. Confusion. Blades unsheathing. The sound of shouting. Magic unfettered. A poisonous air. The cry of death. Was it simple luck or evidence of the prophecy that the young novice they were sheltering escaped that night? That she stumbled forward, alive, into the warm dark. That her protectors had not failed her, in the end, and that she moved now towards new bodyguards, unlikely bodyguards. Not quite heroes, but fellow travelers, if from worlds so unlike her own. And with death behind her, and rendezvous with a fated future ahead, she wondered if that wasn't better, maybe? To spend some time not with champions of virtue or mythic figures, but with regular Perpetuans just like her. This week on Perpetua: The Shadow of the Dragon Tower Pt. 1 Perpetua Guide [In Progress v.01] Hey everyone, we made it to release! Welcome to this new FAQ for Perpetua. Because the site's system is Biased towards walkthroughs that are A) oldest B) most updated, I'm releasing this guide on day 1 even though it's pretty slim right now! And unlike some other FAQ writers, I'm not just copying whatever they say in the \"official guide.\" So that means you can actually TRUST what's here. Anyway, on to the good stuff! Playable Characters - Western Scenario [PPCW] Elena Millefiori (she/her) [EMPC] Identity: Megadungeon Hostess Theme: Tourism Origin: Passika Megadungeon Rillspur Classes: Chanter, Spiritualist, Elementalist Stats: DEX 6, INS 10, MIG 6, WLP 10 The Prelude did NOT make me think that the Passikan dungeons had \"hostesses\" but whatever! Elena is the western party's de facto combat mage. Don't be fooled by her looks, she's one of the hardest hitting members in the party for SURE. Yes, she has those bard-like chants, and those are cool, but let me tell you, her elementalism spells pack a punch. Starter Tip: Her BARRIER spell is essential in the early game before you start to get better armor. Always keep it up! Jonathan (he/him) [JNPC] Identity: An elderly Terrapine gear-head Theme: Curiosity Origin: Clay Ridge Classes: Tinkerer, Loremaster Stats: DEX 8, INS 10, MIG 6, WLP 8 Remember this guy from Prelude!? Everyone was debating whether any of the demo characters were gonna show up in the full game, and basically NO ONE thought about the weird turtle man. But here he is! He's a \"gear head,\" which means he can make magical gadgets and devices. Yes that means to use him right, you really have to learn how to craft and how to manage your IP. BUT if you do, it really pays off. Starter Tip: Jonathan is MORE THAN JUST HIS MAGICANNON. Yes it's powerful. But his Magispheres are great too. Remember to use Acceleration! \"Uncle Nicky\" Nikolas \"Niko Da Shark\" Dashiell (he/him) [UNPC] Identity: Redeemed Scoundrel Chef Theme: Anger Origin: Sonnerean Classes: Dark Blade, Gourmet Stats: Dex 10, INS 8, MIG 8, WLP 6 I have to say I did NOT expect this guy's backstory (mobster turned traveling chef? Cool!)! I also really didn't expect how much his unique cooking mechanics change every layer of the game. Unlike in the East scenario, traveling with this group always has a benefit because you're constantly finding new ingredients. He's also definitely the best physical damage dealer this party has. Plus, the way he gets furious in combat is hilarious. Starter tip: Give him the best armor you can, because even though he isn't a tank, a lot of his abilities are based on getting hit. Veile Lynndel (she/her) [VLPC] Identity: Chosen Priestess Theme: Duty Origin: Pastoral Chapel of Salann Classes: Orator, Entropist Stats: DEX 6, INS 10, MIG 6, WLP 10 I guess I can't say for sure, but this \"girl of prophecy\" is definitely one of those high potential characters who will get way, way better as you level her up. That doesn't mean her starting skill set is weak, it's just that she's very support focused in the early game. Interestingly: She has the same starting stats as Elena—and I think it's funny that they keep having scenes together where they're sort of compared/contrasted. Starter tip: The ability Lucky 7 is BROKEN. Don't forget that if you have a low number \"saved\" in your Lucky slot, you can use it on a great roll just to cycle it out and put something better in!

      "description": "The gale of history rattles across vast Perpetua today. Skyfairing armadas glide towards battle on warm winds. Lines of succession are cynically drawn in breezy, courtly halls, while an ill, stagnant air settles onto once vibrant arcanic academies. It is the year 401 BE, just over four centuries BEFORE the END. But the skies remain blue above Perpetua, and today's wind also carries new heroes into history's current. Heroes drawn up from across the wide world, bringing their unique knowledge, skill, experience, curiosity, passion, strength, and spirit with them. Heroes who carry the best qualities of their people—and in some cases, their most desperate hopes! After all, regardless of what the wind carries, it flows in one direction, as it always has, as—it is said—it always will.. Despair. Authority. Hunger. Grief. Violence. Inevitability. Malevolence. Doom It is in the face of these that our heroes yet rise on the air. In fact, it is towards them which they fly, riding Perpetua's cyclonic winds! Lifting up from Grand Sonnerie, from the Hundred Burroughs, from ancient Rilspur and blustery Bilough, from the simple seaside town of Salaan… and even from the dark underbelly of Calstega Bay. Drawn together by something not yet clear—freedom or fate or intervention into either—but held together by their own bonds, growing ever deeper, even as the clock ticks towards a final confrontation.

      "description": "With the information they need secured, the adventurers sent by the Hundred Burroughs begin to gather together and make their final survey of Perpetua's western continent before returning east. But some of the most dangerous creatures (and people) are yet to be discovered. This week on Friends at the Table: Perpetua Prelude 06 PERPETUA PRELUDE - GUIDE Random Encounters - [PPRE] If you've reached the world map, you know that during travel there's always a chance of hitting a \"Journey Event\" (aka a random encounter if you're using regular words). Most of these are just fights against the enemies tied to that area (go to 'Enemy Locations [PPEL]' for more on that), but there's a low percentage chance that you'll get either an NPC dialog encounter, a mini-location/dungeon, or a special fight that's different than the normal enemy ones. We haven't figured out all of these yet, so make sure to add any you find on the pinned post on the forum! Dog Chase [REDL]: I don't know why it's called this given that it isn't really a dog at all, BUT it is really a chase. If you're trying to trigger this event, try to stay near the plains or hills, and MAKE SURE your party is led by someone with high Dex so that you have a good shot of succeeding. Hexcloak Interrogation [REHC]: This can happen even before you make it to their secret base. There are a TON of random questions they can ask you, and I'm still working on building a guide for all the answers. The short version is that you should always choose the options that admit that you're a little bit guilty of something. If you try to plead innocence, it'll turn into a fight EVEN IF YOU ARE INNOCENT! But if you tell them you're a little guilty, you can get out of the encounter with just a bribe or even scott free. BTW: Arley cannot trigger this event, maybe because he's an elf! The Clock Tolls [REGC]: At the end of every week when traveling near Grand Sonnerie, the bell attached to that big clock they have rings, and there's a random buff or debuff applied to your WHOLE PARTY. You can get various elemental resistances or weaknesses, debuffs like enraged or confused, or even major boons like being fully healed. Be careful though because there's a really small chance that one of your party members will just die.

      "description": "With new knowledge about the state—and future—of their world, the group of travelers take up their exploration again. Some learn first hand about this continent's fauna—majestic, mighty, and mystifying. One finds more evidence of the Valte Empire's violent search for their own answers. And some, in search of peace and quiet, finds himself facing evidence not of some dark future to come, but of a puzzling past. This week on Friends at the Table: Perpetua Prelude 05 PERPETUA PRELUDE - GUIDE Enemies - [PPEN] Valte Soldier [ENVS]: You'll fight a lot of these guys. Depending on the 3d model they're a bat or a dove, but at least in the demo, that doesn't seem to make much of a difference. They're flying, so you have to knock them down before you can do melee damage to them. Basic grunts. Valte Commander [ENVC]: The Valtese (Valtean? Valtican?) Commanders are a lot of tougher than the basic grunts are, and unfortunately, they can also summon the regular soldiers too. Knock them out of the air and then try to stun or debuff them quick! Mysterious Seaslimes [ENMS]: I love the way these enemies are actually each a SWARM of little weird gecko-y slime guys. They focus on debuffs like Slow and Enraged, so be sure to have Tonics on hand when you're passing through their forest. The Dragon-Fish [ENDF]: I can't stress this enough: This is an optional boss in Prelude, and it's hard as hell. Maybe in the full game you can beat it or maybe there's a quest related to it, but for now, it'll just kick your ass. Someone on the forum claims they beat it and only got like 5 XP and a quest item called \"Strange Scale\" that you can't use anywhere. NOT WORTH IT. Lobble Traveler [ENLT]: Just kidding. But I DO wish you could fight this ANNOYING freak. Hexcloak [ENHC]: Did you know that if you grind in the southern tip of the demo, there's like a .5% chance you'll run into a Hexcloak? You learn their deal towards the end of the demo, but this is the only way you can actually see them in action. They're strong, but if you've maxed out your party (or at least hit the level 10 max in the demo), you can probably win this fight! And if you do, you'll get a random elemental cloak drop from them. Of course, if you can win this fight, you probably don't need better gear anyway!

      "description": "With supplies in their packs and an increasingly detailed map, the explorers travel further through Perpetua's western continent. While some learn more about local nature and culture, others stumble towards larger truths. A star descending from the heavens. A fleet across the blue. The striking of a clock… the ringing of a bell… This week on Friends at the table: Perpetua Prelude 04 PERPETUA PRELUDE - GUIDE Factions - [PPFC] Not much is known about these groups because the demo cuts off so early, but between some dialog, that one cutscene, and some screenshots, here's what I think is going on with them: Grande Sonnerie [FCGS] : That's the big city at the end of Prelude. It's a big city but also maybe a kingdom? Not sure if it has other cities and stuff, but it definitely has the four big districts (including the root magic school). Seems like a traditional fantasy kingdom, but I don't know if it has a king or a princess or what. The Elevana League [FCEL]: This is where Arley is from originally. It's like a bunch of elven (stupid) city-states (cool). One for each element/god. Not clear if they get along or not, but they do have those special warrior mages. The Dragon Watchers [FCDW]: The demo basically starts with these guys. They have both dragon \"squires\" and dragon \"scryers,\" and I know they worship the dragons, but it's not clear what that means. I hope they can ride them and that you can recruit one, but we'll see. The Holy Protectorate of Placidia [FCPP]: From what I can tell, Duriel, the one arena-based god city, is tied to this faction. Maybe they worship the gods? I remember an interview where someone said that the full game has a whole story about a prophecy, so maybe they're tied to that. The Hundred Burroughs [FCHB]: Even though Prelude sometimes says \"burroughs\" and sometimes says \"burrows,\" I'm saying BURROUGHS. Harlow sucks but he isn't a mole or something, so why would it be \"burrows\"? Anyway, it's all schools and stuff over there. Again: they say it's magic but neither of the two characters we've seen from there (from the Prelude or in the screenshots) actually USE MAGIC so wtf? Valte, the Winged Empire of the Blue Hour [FCVL]: These guys are my favorite. Why? Three reasons: 1. They can fly. 2. They have cool military stuff. 3. They're basically the ONLY ONES actually DOING ANYTHING about stuff. Yeah, yeah, they're probably the \"bad guys\" but the coolest characters are. The Passikan Remnants [FCPR]: There's that one water dungeon in Prelude that's tied to them, but that's IT. I don't know what their deal is at all, but it's probably cool because the dungeon is cool. The Ennead [FCEN]: Okay so I think those are the \"The Ennead\" which is a word that means \"a group of nine gods.\" I'll be honest, I TOTALLY missed them but JesseSetGo pointed the word in the background in Duriel out on the forums, and I went back and looked and saw it not only there but also in Grand Sonnerie, so it's not just the same church as the Placidia or whatever.

      "description": "After making emergency landings all across Perpetua's western continent, Glesi, Yukai, Harlow, Tomor, and Arley have begun to find their footing—if not each other. Now, they leave where they landed, and begin to make their way across this mysterious land in search of answers to the question that brought them here to begin with: What is the Altar of Perpetua? This week on Friends at the Table: Perpetua Prelude 03 PERPETUA PRELUDE - GUIDE ITEMS AND MATERIALS - [PPIM] Sheldonica Ore [IMSO]: An incredible mat used to upgrade your gear. If you put it on a weapon, it gets bonus Fire damage. If you slot it onto armor, you get major fire resistance. That said, there's only one piece of this in Perpetua Prelude, which means you should plan ahead about how you want to use it. Hopefully there will be more in the full game. Invernal Branch [IMIB]: The bonus it gives you to navigation and floral communication is not worth the fact that it adds a CONSTANT running commentary during every fight. They did not record enough lines for this one. It will get on your nerves, I PROMISE. Stitchscore Bouncer [IMSB]: No, not a bouncer like the guy who stands out in front of the club and looks scary. It's a bouncing ball. You can use it on a few puzzles in the Adventure Fields, but it can also be used as a ranged weapon that will do a random number of bounces (read: attacks) per turn. It does low damage but the number of attacks it does is an OPEN ENDED COIN FLIP, which means that theoretically it could do infinite damage. It's just not very likely! Encyclopaedia Catastrophica [IMEC]: Not only does this unmissable item—which you get during the Grand Academy of the Collapse chapter—unlock a TON of lore in the Codex, it's also the most powerful ranged magic weapon in the demo. If you're scratching your head because you didn't find it, that's because you can't find it on your first playthrough for obvious reasons that would be obvious if you already DID beat it. But on Re-Prelude Mode, you'll get it early on. Since this is obviously a No Spoilers guide, that's all I'll say about THAT.

      "description": "Minds driven by curiosity and hearts filled with hope, the expedition group sets off across the sea that separates their homeland from the rest of the world. From the perspective offered by their airship, they get a taste of what is to come: Palaces and plazas! Mountains and rivers! Strange, draconic towers! A land of life and lore, filled with knowledge yet unknown to them! But first… there's the matter of the smoke coming from the engine room. This week: Perpetua Prelude 02 PERPETUA PRELUDE - BASICS GUIDE EXPEDITION MEMBER INFO - [PPEMI] ARLEY BATES [EAB] Specialization: Collector Value: Thrill Disposition: Jovial The Prince of Salix, one of the major elven city states on the eastern continent of Perpetua. Great all around pick! While you should definitely use his cooking skills, he's more than just a chef! Because he starts with a walking staff and lantern, he excels when exploring. TOMOR PRESH [ETP] Specialization: Explorer Value: Curious Disposition: Challenge Forged in the heat of the Parisolian Mines, Tomor Presh is a hot-blooded champion of justice who likes to stick his nose into problems even when he isn't invited. Good thing he's tough enough to win when he does! He really has \"developer assigned protagonist\" energy, so if that's your thing, give him a shot. GLESI SYDNEY & YUKAI [EMGY] Specialization: Nomand Value: Beauty Disposition: Focused / Defensive An exiled nomad and her cursed (?) pet. As the only \"paired hero\" in Perpetua Prelude, Glesi & Yukai offer a unique—and advanced—style of play. If you're willing to put in the work to understand the game's systems and their eccentric design, then you'll be rewarded with one of the coolest character stories in the game. Plus, you get to look cooler than anyone else! HARLOW PRESH [EMHP] Specialization: Scientist Value: Safety Disposition: Awkward A mage from the academy of the Hundred Burroughs. This guy stinks. It's cool that he starts with four extra coin, but once you blow through that you're stuck with all his annoying voice and animations. He doesn't even do any real magic. SKIP HIM!

Track the yearly increase in travel during the harvest season. Re-read the stories of the pigs and the soil and cross-reference the lyrics of the major rondeaux. Ah, do you see it now? A feast hall. And its cellar.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for body horror, injury and magical intoxication Like many of the truths of Realis, the nature of the Creature—conceptually—is contingent on context and subjectivity. In illustration: For the Child, the Dog may be First a companion, Second a responsibility, and Third a curious sliver of raw wilderness. For the Parent, the Dog may be First a living lesson, Second a dutiful guard, and Third, a fellow Caregiver, capable of providing food, shelter, and spiritual guidance for the Child in their own absence. Expand such a survey to include the Fisher, the Ranger (Scout), the Ranger (Herder), the Butcher, or, not least of all, the fellow Beast, and you will have a deluge of truth, each insisting on its own merit. One wonders: Why do so few dare ask the Creature to speak for itself?

      "description": "As far as traveling spectacles go, the Krinsky Family Circus has it good. Because it only operates on the four moons of the Tetraspherica, which orbit close enough for low orbit shuttles to traverse, it does not need to rely on the mercurial whims of an Orphan Vessel. And because of the variety of cultures encountered on its circuit, there is always the opportunity to find new hires and encounter fellow showmen from which new techniques. Most of all, because the route is short and reliable, Those Nerveless Chancers are able to do more than simply skate across the surface of the local culture, little more than tourists. They're able to dig a little deeper, so to speak. A little curiosity and some sharp application of professional skill is all it takes to open the right doors… Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austinwalker on bluesky) Featuring Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal on bluesky) Produced by Ali Acampora Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Cover Art by by Oddesque With thanks to Amelia Renee, Arthur B., Bill Kaszubski, Cassie Jones, Clark, DB, Daniel Laloggia, Diana Crowley, Edwin Adelsberger, Emrys, Greg Cobb, Ian O'Dea, Ian Urbina, Irina A., Jack Shirai, Jake Strang, Katie Diekhaus, Ken George, Konisforce, Kristina Harris Esq, L Tantivy, Lawson Coleman, Mark Conner, Mike & Ruby, Muna A, Nat Knight, Nich Maragos, Olive Perry, Quinn Pollock, Robert Lasica, Shawn Drape, Shawn Hall, Summer Rose, TeganEden, Thomas Whitney, Voi, chocoube, deepFlaw, fen, & weakmint This episode was made with support from listeners like you!

      "description": "Ulled is a pocked and placid-seeming agricultural moon. But as the saying goes, be wary the still lake. Yes, farmers speak softly and tend to their crops with loving cultivation. Yes, life is quiet and late afternoons are restful. Yes, harvest work brings reward. But then there is underneath. There is underneath. But Those Nerveless Chancers, The Krinsky Family Circus And Travelling Curiosity, they know only what is above. They know they step on fertile soil and soft grass, perfect for staking their tents and stands. They know they walk through fields under the lights and shadows of the Citadel Bein, a fortress layered with history so visible that it is seemingly built from the accretion of time itself. They know that they stand above a castle village sonorous with the sounds of marketplaces and buskers and craftshops—a circus of a different type than their own, but not altogether unfamiliar. They know they stand on a geological shelf, the shore of a vast, shimmering lake beyond—open like a sea , polished as a mirror , reflecting the sky above, reflecting the Thousand Moons in conlunation, reflecting Realis-itself, and in its light The Tetraspherica: Three more marble-like moons. Cousin orbs. Neighbor spheres dominating the heavens above. So is it any wonder they do not consider what might be below? What might move in that fertile soil or between the blades of that soft grass? What else might have staked a claim on Placid Ulled? Or who else might move in the shadows of the citadel Bein? What else might hover above the echoes of the castle town? Who else might stare out onto the lake's horizon, might witness the impossible beauty of the dancing lunar quartet, might bathe in the bluelight of Realis-Itself, and radiating with pure possibility, dream!? It is no wonder at all. Such is life on the Thousand Moons. Such is life for those Nerveless Chancers, that circus caught in gravity. At least, for now.

      "description": "I want you to close your eyes and imagine with me: Imagine Realis Itself, the Radiant Planet at the heart of the Thousand Moons, that orb which lights the cosmos entire. Above it, the betrayer star, the Corpse Sun, red and sick and pulsing ill, small and fainter by the day. Below it, hungry and roiling, the Great Void, an abyss of voracious clouds. And in between, those thousand moons, countless except you know their number. Varied eternally, yet all dwarfed by the azure orb around which they glide. And there, bring them to mind too: Four colorful moons, spinning and buzzing and twirling around each other. Do you remember their names? The names of the Tetraspherica? The Speckled Quartet, the Marbled Quartenion? Those spinning, glorious jewels—unique even among all thousand of the moons of Realis? Let me tell remind you: Placid Ulled. World of farms, of cultivation, of soil—and of what lies beneath it. The Crux. A vast colosseum world where victory, glory, and power have been rendered equivalent. Prismatic Principia: Home to the Endless Academy, whose halls house famed philosophers, eager alchemists, mages, and—it seems—the occasional ghost as well. And Hypnotic Dokine, where mists mystify, clouds corrode, and the light always reveals a new truth. For as Long as Long had been, these four vibrant moons have swung with dancer's rhythm around one another. Long before the great Powers spread their influence across the orbital sphere, long before the founders of Sphenic Polytechnic revived the Orphan Vessels, LONG BEFORE THE MOONFOLK UNDERSTOOD THEY WERE THE MOONFOLK, those who lived on the worlds of the Tetraspherica knew each other as neighbors, traveling through orbital shuttle, exchanging supplies and stories, marrying and moving and making lives together. \"True as the tetrad,\" the saying goes. A stable waltz. Four marbles in alignment. Eternal. Reliable. Unshakeable. But today… in the shadow of an Ulledd mountain, in the keep of the Citadel Bein, where negotiators bicker and showmen entertain and lords gather for a feast, a treacherous conspiracy unfolds… Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austinwalker on bluesky) Featuring Ali Acampora, Keith J Carberry and Art Martinez-Tebbel Produced by Ali Acampora Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Cover Art by by Oddesque With thanks to Amelia Renee, Arthur B., Bill Kaszubski, Cassie Jones, Clark, DB, Daniel Laloggia, Diana Crowley, Edwin Adelsberger, Emrys, Greg Cobb, Ian O'Dea, Ian Urbina, Irina A., Jack Shirai, Jake Strang, Katie Diekhaus, Ken George, Konisforce, Kristina Harris Esq, L Tantivy, Lawson Coleman, Mark Conner, Mike & Ruby, Muna A, Nat Knight, Nich Maragos, Olive Perry, Quinn Pollock, Robert Lasica, Shawn Drape, Shawn Hall, Summer Rose, TeganEden, Thomas Whitney, Voi, chocoube, deepFlaw, fen, & weakmint, This episode was made with support from listeners like you!

      "description": "Two and a half years ago, towards the end of our NNAFN fundraiser , I announced that I was making a game called Realis. That game is now here—at least in Ashcan form. So, what is Realis? Realis is a cursed orbital sphere of 1,000 mystical moons filled with mystery, magic, and impossible technology. Realis is a game of diceless storytelling, where characters deploy powerful Sentences, which are rewritten over the course of their saga. And it's available right now. This Ashcan version is being published by Possible Worlds Games . This version has 20 Playable Classes and 40 NPC Classes (both of which are less than half of what will be available in the final edition), three Grand Factions, two Example Moons, art by Sam Beck and Oddesque , and layout by Tyler Crumrine. It has some additional design and writing by Friends at the Table's own Jack de Quidt and Janine Hawkins. So, that is Realis. And today, we start our campaign of the game, beginning with this introduction to the game featuring me and Jack, free for all listeners of Friends at the Table. Then, tomorrow, all $5 members of our Patreon will get access to the character creation for our ongoing, Patreon-exclusive Realis campaign—and will receive a new episode every week for the first couple of months, as we catch up with our overdue Patreon episodes. And guess what: The whole first arc of that campaign will also be free, available here in this feed, just one week behind the Patreon release. Once that's over, we'll begin our next full, main feed season, Perpetua, where we'll be playing Fabula Ultima. We've already begun recording that, too, and it's been a blast. I can't wait for y'all to hear what we've been cooking up. (Oh, and definitely go listen to Media Club Plus . We're headed into the most exciting and dramatic part of the Chimera Ant Arc, and now is the best time to catch up with us!)

      "description": "Hello! Welcome to the Palisade post-mortem! I struggle to find something to write here that isn't covered in this nearly five hour episode so let's just go over the important announcements. New Merch! We've added some new merch to friendsattetable.shop to celebrate our 10th year anniversary and the end of Palisade! The hat and shirt will be available for as long as possible but the poster is a limited edition item only being sold until October 1st! Based on some potential issues with getting a good size and fulfillment, we've decided to ship this from a different method than Fourthwall--meaning right now we're selling it until October 1st and then will ship out the orders! There is a small chance the poster will get re-added at only size 12x18 to stay consistent like our other products, so if you're interested in the other sizes (8x12 and 4x6), get your order in asap! Our next season will be titled Perpetua and we will be playing Fabula Ultima ! That's all we're able to share right now as we're still working on developing the season but we're all SO excited to dig into this new system! Please pardon the empty feed while we give ourselves time to make something incredible, the wait will be so so worth it. REALIS (a game system written by Austin Walker) will be hitting our patreon SOON! I think that I said end of September some time in this recording, because sometimes you just say a thing into a microphone after five hours, but please expect it closer to mid to late October. Oops! As you might imagine, the extended finale of Palisade really made a mess of our timeline... ontop of developing a new season! HOWEVER, with the current Patreon backlog, the entire first session/adventure will be released weekly on our patreon until we're caught up and switch back to monthly episodes. We intend to put those episodes onto the feed a few weeks later so in the mean time... PLEASE GET EXCITED!!! :) A Chaotic Cataloging: A Seasons of Hieron Fanzine has smashed through it's goal and they have a ton of community copies! If this is something you didn't check out because funds are tight, please use the wonderful resource our generous fans have provided for you and enjoy some sick Hieron art!!! And if you DO have some walking around money and want to get some of the higher tier goodies, all the funds go to a good cause so check them out! Thank you so so so so so much everyone for all of your support. Here's to many more years of Friends at the Table!!! (emoji of two cups clinking together)",

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for mental manipulation, body horror, and death. Hours after defeating Artifice, and hours before Motion's flagship breaches the far end of the battlefield, an uncomfortable buzz runs through the air. Even with the reinforcements from Millennium Break and the Apostolosians loyal to Cas'alear Rizah, the defenders of Perennial are outnumbered. Worse: Great heroics on the battlefield might fell a Divine or rout a batallion, but how do you stop a machine god who exists across the whole galaxy, dormant in every particle of the Perennial Wave. Such a feat would require more than battlefield brilliance... This week on PALISADE: Above the Earth Pt. 5 Damn, you look like you had a bad time / You look like you don't even know why Dossier People Audacious Opportunity \"A.O.\" Rooke (he/him): Once an Orion mercenary, then the commander of the Rapid Evening's \"toughs\" squad, and now a unit leader for Millennium Break. K.O Rooke's son. Kueen Overture \"K.O\" Rooke (she/her): A long time dispatcher and operator of the Scrivener's Guild, KO has taken the role as a major commander in Millennium Break. Mother of A.O. Rooke. Passiflora (she/her): Elect of the divine Artiface, naive but devoted to the vision promised to her by The Pact of Free States. Xiphion, aka Zig'ell Barbos, aka The Red Roc (zig/zig's, he/him) : Elect of the Divine Valour and icon of the Apostolosian military. Zig'ell kept his Apostolosian name in personal use even after being chosen by Valour as its elect. Famed for zig's talent as a pilot and commander, zig spent years serving as Cas'alear Rizah's confidant and lieutenant, before being promoted and transferred into service directly under the Divine Motion. In her absence, his profile only grew as he secured wins against the Bilateral Intercession. Now that Motion has revived, Zig'ell has returned to her service with optimism and loyalty--quieting any doubts through a commitment to the larger project of the Pact. Organizations The Pact of Free States: One of the two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, a joint operation by Stels Columnar and Apostolos. Before they were killed by Kalvin Brnine, they were led in name by the Glorious Princept, Dahlia (they/them), but were controlled in day-to-day matters by members of the original Pact of Necessary Venture, including Rye (he/him) and Gallica (she/her). With all three dead, the Divine Motion has rushed to fill a vacuum many feel but can hardly give word to. Under her control, the long-held \"reformist\" goals of the Stel have been set aside for simple, metaphysical domination. Places Earth: Ancient home of humanity. Moved into orbit around the center of the galaxy by the Old Earth Cult, under guidance by a manipulative and influential divine called Independence. Divines The Divine Integrity (it/its): Sometimes appearing as an articulated staff or a metallic spine, Integrity integrates itself into its chosen user. Once the two are connected, Integrity becomes a powerful exoskeleton, and supports its user in matters of military and morale. Until being assassinated by Brnine, Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, was the elect of Integrity. Now, it has found a new home in Thisbe. The Divine Motion (she/her): One of the founding members of the Pact, the necromantic Apostolosian divine once led its infamous retinue, the Black Century, on Partizan. They were defeated and dispersed, turned into part of Kalmeria, during Operation Shackled Sun. Now, she has returned to take control of the Pact of Free States, and has set her sights on Perennial at the heart of the galaxy. The Divine Present (it/its): On first blush, Present might be confused for a small, if luxurious frigate. And sometimes, it is just that: Its oval structure houses living quarters, a humble armory, enough cargo space to hold a single hollow, and even a fully stocked bar. But at a snap of its elect's fingers, it transforms into a humanoid war machine that serves its elect loyally, outclasses any Altar currently in operation, and is capable of holding its own against many other Divines in combat. The Divine Commitment (it/its): A malleable divine made of inky black metal that has become one with the body of the Ekpyrosis, flagship of the Pact's fleet. Has historically required two pilots (both in a condition of ego death) in order to be operated, but currently operates alone, tethered by something like loyalty to the Divine Motion. How such obedience was garnered is unclear. The Divine Valour: A machine the size of a large Hallow, Valour can transform between a vast, roc-like bird form and a more traditional humanoid model. Soldiers claim that serving under Valour gives them a noticeable boost to their morale, but it is unclear if this is a feature of their proximity to the Divine or to its elect. Objects The Ekpyrosis: Flagship of the Pact's fleet, a transforming, beautiful monstrosity designed to casually destroy worlds while simultaneously supporting life in a vacuum. In the time since Commitment's takeover, though, it has changed dramatically. Columnar Altars: Though Exenceaster March took his research with him when he defected from Columnar and the Zenith Fund he once led, those engineers who remained loyal to their Stel had learned enough to develop their own rival machine, powered not only by Kalmeria, but also by upscaled (and stolen) Equiaxed designs. The result: The ZFC-Wizard. Central to this design is the modularity and iconic visual design that has been core to Columnar technology for generations. The stock Wizard is rarely seen as-is. Instead, it is used as a frame for a number of other variants. The ZFC-TOME is the workhorse model of the Wizard, able to hold its ground defensively with a massive claymore and an arcane \"breath\" weapon. The ZFC-STAVE is a designated marksman unit, while the CLOAK was designed to operate behind enemy lines without being caught. Two commander class units were created as well. The ORB houses the Wizard frame inside of a sphere, which projects a directed energy field to its allies, serving as a shield. The TALISMAN , with its swarm of hard-to-control drones, was designed especially for ace pilots who lead from the front with near-impossible acumen. Apostolosian Altars: In the age of Kalmeria, Apostolosian culture became fascinated with mastery over (and blending with) the natural and elemental. As such, it is no surprise to see that their Altars (designed in collaboration with Columnar's Zenith Fund), reflect those new interests. The ZFA-FANG is a new version of an old classic: A Hypercat model with mounted freeze cannons and the ability to skate on ice it creates. The ZFA-TALON offers air supremacy, firing powerful, flaming beams and dropping dense explosive salvos. Both operate with greater efficiency when deployed directly alongside their allies. Operating as an on field commander, the ZFA-TUSK is a defensive powerhouse that can chase down enemies with incredible, wind-driven speeds. Mysteries Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has bonded with elements of Autonomy Itself and the Divine Motion to create Kalmeria. Arbor : The result of Thisbe's year of research of Divines, Axioms, and plant life--all three of which have homes in her own body. A growing organism with unknown powers. Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Sylvi Bullet ( @sylvibullet ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Cover Art by by aurahack ( aurahack.jp ) With thanks to Amelia Renee, Arthur B., Bill Kaszubski, Cassie Jones, chocoube, Clark, DB, deepFlaw, Edwin Adelsberger, Emrys, Greg Cobb, Ian O'Dea, Ian Urbina, Irina A., Jack Shirai, Jake Strang, Katie Diekhaus, Ken George, Kristina Harris Esq, L Tantivy, Mark Conner, Mike & Ruby, Muna A, Nat Knight, Nich Maragos, Quinn Pollock, Robert Lasica, Shawn Drape, Shawn Hall, Summer Rose, TeganEden, Thomas Whitney, and weakmint for their support For the finale, we are playing Questlandia 2nd Edition.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for mental manipulation. At the center of the galaxy, the battle rages. Outnumbered, Cori and Thisbe turn to powers divine and profane in order to turn the tide, while Levi goes toe to toe with foes ten times his size. Brnine, Hunting--along with the the crews of the Blue Channel, Starcrossed, and Stolen Cameo--support their forces on the ground below. And in the depths of the station, Exeter Leap leads Cas'alear Rizah deeper into the maze, where the scion of Apostolos hopes to deliver an address that will change the galaxy forever. This week on PALSIADE: Above the Earth Pt. 3 I'm a sinner, you a sinner / I can see the devil grinning Dossier Organizations The Pact of Free States: One of the two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, a joint operation by Stels Columnar and Apostolos. Before they were killed by Kalvin Brnine, they were led in name by the Glorious Princept, Dahlia (they/them), but were controlled in day-to-day matters by members of the original Pact of Necessary Venture, including Rye (he/him) and Gallica (she/her). With all three dead, the Divine Motion has rushed to fill a vacuum many feel but can hardly give word to. Under her control, the long-held \"reformist\" goals of the Stel have been set aside for simple, metaphysical domination. Places Earth: Ancient home of humanity. Moved into orbit around the center of the galaxy by the Old Earth Cult, under guidance by a manipulative and influential divine called Independence. Divines The Divine Integrity (it/its): Sometimes appearing as an articulated staff or a metallic spine, Integrity integrates itself into its chosen user. Once the two are connected, Integrity becomes a powerful exoskeleton, and supports its user in matters of military and morale. Until being assassinated by Brnine, Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, was the elect of Integrity. Now, it has found a new home in Thisbe. The Divine Motion (she/her): One of the founding members of the Pact, the necromantic Apostolosian divine once led its infamous retinue, the Black Century, on Partizan. They were defeated and dispersed, turned into part of Kalmeria, during Operation Shackled Sun. Now, she has returned to take control of the Pact of Free States, and has set her sights on Perennial at the heart of the galaxy. The Divine Present (it/its): On first blush, Present might be confused for a small, if luxurious frigate. And sometimes, it is just that: Its oval structure houses living quarters, a humble armory, enough cargo space to hold a single hollow, and even a fully stocked bar. But at a snap of its elect's fingers, it transforms into a humanoid war machine that serves its elect loyally, outclasses any Altar currently in operation, and is capable of holding its own against many other Divines in combat. Objects Columnar Altars: Though Exenceaster March took his research with him when he defected from Columnar and the Zenith Fund he once led, those engineers who remained loyal to their Stel had learned enough to develop their own rival machine, powered not only by Kalmeria, but also by upscaled (and stolen) Equiaxed designs. The result: The ZFC-Wizard. Central to this design is the modularity and iconic visual design that has been core to Columnar technology for generations. The stock Wizard is rarely seen as-is. Instead, it is used as a frame for a number of other variants. The ZFC-TOME is the workhorse model of the Wizard, able to hold its ground defensively with a massive claymore and an arcane \"breath\" weapon. The ZFC-STAVE is a designated marksman unit, while the CLOAK was designed to operate behind enemy lines without being caught. Two commander class units were created as well. The ORB houses the Wizard frame inside of a sphere, which projects a directed energy field to its allies, serving as a shield. The TALISMAN , with its swarm of hard-to-control drones, was designed especially for ace pilots who lead from the front with near-impossible acumen. Apostolosian Altars: In the age of Kalmeria, Apostolosian culture became fascinated with mastery over (and blending with) the natural and elemental. As such, it is no surprise to see that their Altars (designed in collaboration with Columnar's Zenith Fund), reflect those new interests. The ZFA-FANG is a new version of an old classic: A Hypercat model with mounted freeze cannons and the ability to skate on ice it creates. The ZFA-TALON offers air supremacy, firing powerful, flaming beams and dropping dense explosive salvos. Both operate with greater efficiency when deployed directly alongside their allies. Operating as an on field commander, the ZFA-TUSK is a defensive powerhouse that can chase down enemies with incredible, wind-driven speeds. Mysteries Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has bonded with elements of Autonomy Itself and the Divine Motion to create Kalmeria.

      "description": "Under the command of Levitation Cascabel-Gardner, and supported by an ad-hoc alliance with Millennium Break, the pirate crew of the Precipice, and the dedicated loyalists of exiled Apokine Cas'alear Rizah, an operation at the center of the galaxy begins. At the center: A strip of metal as long as a city and as deep as a geological straum, which produces and spreads an endless wave of nanomachiens across the Milky Way. To its relative north, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, menacing despite its apparently safe distance. To its east: The holy node where Perennial first came into control of the station. To its west, three Portcullis gates under control of the Pact of Free states,, nearing their completion; beyond, the Ekpyrosis, helmed by Motion, and surrounded by a fleet of allies. And to the south, Earth, and three heroic ships approaching at high speeds.

      "description": "With a fleet of Pact vessels heading towards Perennial's station at the center of the Milky Way, Levi Cascabel-Gardner, Exeter Leap, and the reunited crew of the Blue Channel join with their allies on the beaches of the nearest world. There, they prepare for what is to come: Searching for new tools, drawing formations in the sand, and connecting with the very currents of reality. It is a place they know well, a time of preparation and planning. One last, long held breath under blue skies. This week on PALISADE: Above the Earth Pt. 1 I think it was the first time I realized that I could change the world Dossier People Telford Stare (he/they): One of several foremen tied to the Lone Marble Group's contractor operations division. Organizations The Frontier Syndicate: A powerful conglomerate with a broad purview, including technology, heavy industry, entertainment, telecommunications, and transportation. Led by Exenceaster March (he/him) , the Syndicate betrayed the Pact of Free States and joined the Bilats in order to be part of their colonization efforts on Palisade. Developed the Altar, the predominant war machine of the current era. The Lone Marble Group: Built around a single artifact recovered from an Advent facility, this Frontier Syndicate subsidiary develops the future of Bilat war machinery. The Church of Received Asterism: The most widely practiced faith in the galaxy, and one of the earliest major organizations in the Divine Principality, created at the beginning of the Miraculous Millenium, over 3000 years ago. Teaches that Divines, the immortal machines and mechs that helped establish the Principality's hold on the galaxy, reflect the best aspects of the state itself. The divine Strength, in other words, is like a living flag of the Principality's own strength. Organized as a central church, led by a religious leader named a \"Cycle,\" whose will is enacted across the Principality by their many \"Songs,\" who rule worlds, star systems, or sometimes entire constellations. The Church of Progressive Asterism: Created as the teachings of the prophet Logos Kantel grew in popularity 1000 years ago, and made a secondary state religion in order to prevent a large schism. Teaches that Divines are true embodiments of their names, and that the citizens and states of the Principality should look to them as guiding stars. The Divine Strength, in other words, is a reflection of strength itself, or maybe \"god's strength,\" and we should aspire to make our strength look like the divine's. Unlike Received Asterism, there is no single central church, but hundreds of smaller sects, schools, and cults, each devoted to individual Divines, grouped sub-pantheons, or otherwise adjusted beliefs. The New Asterism: What was once a schism between Received and Progressive Asterism has now been healed by the false prophet Gur Sevraq (he/they), or at least someone in his name and face. The New Asterism claims that to be a citizen of the Principality is to have an obligation to \"better the world,\" in the sense that one invests in property or in the way that a settler \"rehabilitates\" or \"improves\" the places they claim by violence. If Received Asterism places virtue in the state and Progressive Asterism places it in the Divines, the New Asterism places it in the Principality's mythologized point of origin: The Twilight Mirage. Places Earth: Ancient home of humanity. Moved into orbit around the center of the galaxy by the Old Earth Cult, under guidance by a manipulative and influential divine called Independence. Divines The Divine Integrity (it/its): Sometimes appearing as an articulated staff or a metallic spine, Integrity integrates itself into its chosen user. Once the two are connected, Integrity becomes a powerful exoskeleton, and supports its user in matters of military and morale. Until being assassinated by Brnine, Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, was the elect of Integrity. Now, it has found a new home in Thisbe. The Divine Motion (she/her): One of the founding members of the Pact, the necromantic Apostolosian divine once led its infamous retinue, the Black Century, on Partizan. They were defeated and dispersed, turned into part of Kalmeria, during Operation Shackled Sun. Now, she has returned to take control of the Pact of Free States, and has set her sights on Perennial at the heart of the galaxy. The Divine Present (it/its): On first blush, Present might be confused for a small, if luxurious frigate. And sometimes, it is just that: Its oval structure houses living quarters, a humble armory, enough cargo space to hold a single hollow, and even a fully stocked bar. But at a snap of its elect's fingers, it transforms into a humanoid war machine that serves its elect loyally, outclasses any Altar currently in operation, and is capable of holding its own against many other Divines in combat. Mysteries Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has bonded with elements of Autonomy Itself and the Divine Motion to create Kalmeria.

      "description": "The Twilight Mirage is known for its captivating color, its endless light, its ever-shifting shape, and its penchant for blurring the physical and digital into a poetic reality impossible to deny. But along with these things, it is marked by a unique distance, separated from the galaxy through tumultuous time. In this way, its sunset skies might be better understood to be storm clouds. And as the members of the Blue Channel will come to learn, there are many ways out of a tempest, but all of them require you to move through the rain.

      "description": "With the capture of Lander One, major military operations on Palisade have seemingly come to a close. Most of the remnants of the Bilateral Intercession's forces have been captured or have turned themselves in—though some, like those now under the sway of the re-emergent Motion, have seemingly disappeared altogether. There are, remain, however, some loose and chaotic threads splayed across the planet: The Nidean forces who have wormed their way into the protection of Wakeful, the so-called scattered shards of Divinity (including the Afflictions and the Chimeric Cadent), and, of course, the treacherous Witch of Glass, Clementine. This week on PALISADE: A Palette of Colors Pt. 8 Haven't had a dream in a long time Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Sylvi Bullet ( @sylvibullet ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Text by Austin Walker Cover Art by by aurahack ( aurahack.jp ) With thanks to Amelia Renee, Arthur B., Bill Kaszubski, Cassie Jones, chocoube, Clark, DB, deepFlaw, Edwin Adelsberger, Emrys, Greg Cobb, Ian O'Dea, Ian Urbina, Irina A., Jack Shirai, Jake Strang, Katie Diekhaus, Ken George, Kristina Harris Esq, L Tantivy, Mark Conner, Mike & Ruby, Muna A, Nat Knight, Nich Maragos, Quinn Pollock, Robert Lasica, Shawn Drape, Shawn Hall, Summer Rose, TeganEden, Thomas Whitney, and weakmint for their support For the finale, we are playing Questlandia 2nd Edition.

      "description": "Though it seems the worst is behind the people of Palisade, there is work yet to do. Work made harder by the realization that the work already done had higher costs than anticipated. But still, the members of the Cause do what they must to confront the remaining occupation forces, to bring each other back from the brink, and to steel themselves for what is to come next. This week on PALISADE: A Palette of Colors Pt. 7 Inhale, exhale like never ending / Life before us, light leaving us down Dossier People Lucia Whitestar (she/her): The young \"Lady Whitestar\" emerged as a strategic genius during the early conflict between Kesh and Apostolos on PARTIZAN five years ago. Daughter of the Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. Commands her forces from her flagship, the Lander One with the support of her combat AI, Fire Support (it/its). Places Chimera's Lantern: The second moon of Palisade, shaped oddly like a wasp's nest or paper lantern. New arrivals to the world find its occasional glow unnatural and frightening. Home to the Chimeric Cadent (they/them, it/its), an amalgam of the ancient Excerpt ⸢Signet⸣, the mysterious Waking Cadent, and the Divine Belgard. As one being, they protect the corpses of a number of Divines, including Sagacity, Dissent, Felicity, Barricade, and Bounty—its newest resident. Currently, Stel Nideo's master armsmith, the Divine Consecration, lays siege to the Cadent's refuge, attempting to rebuild an army to reconquer Palisade. Temple of the Threshold: Built at the center of a massive bridge that crosses the Diadem, this temple served as the home of New Asterism and its false prophet until Future fled under the protection of the Devotees. Now, it is home to Wakeful, the (post-)Divine gestalt. Divines The Divine Future (they/them, it/its): An ancient divine, dating back to the second major war in the Golden Branch star sector. Exists in the form of a golden orb slightly larger than a softball or bocce ball, which can either be carried by or hover around its Elect. Historically, it has been bidden to share its unparalleled perspective on the hopes and dreams of its chosen (and the endless vigor with which to pursue those goals). Now, sensing Wakeful's strength, Future has provided the rhetorical pathway for itself, Devotion, Crusade, and the fragments of Stel Nideo on Palisade to come under the gestalt being's protection—and perhaps to reshape its destiny. The Divine Integrity (it/its): Sometimes appearing as an articulated staff or a metallic spine, Integrity integrates itself into its chosen user. Once the two are connected, Integrity becomes a powerful exoskeleton, and supports its user in matters of military and morale. Until being assassinated by Brnine, Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, was the elect of Integrity. Now, it has found a new home in Thisbe. The Divine Motion (she/her): One of the founding members of the Pact, the necromantic Apostolosian divine once led its infamous retinue, the Black Century, on Partizan. They were defeated and dispersed, turned into part of Kalmeria, during Operation Shackled Sun. Mysteries Wakeful (any): Wounded, yet still curious. Cautious, yet still creative. Powerful, yet still vulnerable. Wakeful is a newly emerging, gestalt being composed by the Divines freed from the Garden of Fidelity and the Delegates who have rejoined with them. Wakeful has found itself in an odd position, as the remaining forces of Stel Nideo, the Devotees, and Future vow themselves to what they call its new Kingdom on Palisade. How this new, potentially post-divine being develops—and how it will relate to those who have suffered under occupation on Palisade—remains unclear. The Iconoclasts: Something beyond the human, desperate to eradicate subjectivity itself. After their messenger, the Usher of Truth, was delivered to The Witch in Glass, they have found themselves serving a new master.

      "description": "As Palisade eases into its new orbit, the people below face a new marker of evening. Yes, the dual moons of Chimera's Lantern and Travertine remain above them. But now night brings a new absence: Gone are Gift-3 and Seneschal, Altar and Moonlock, Skein and Crown, Brighton and Thrysus, and of course the new dark sun, Volition. And so, at night, with only the Mirage itself in the sky, the people of Palisade might be able to convince themselves that things have not changed so much. And so, on one such night in the Bontive Valley, it is time for one more—one final?—movie night aboard the Blue Channel. Why me, or better, why you? / When we can fake it like any way we want to People Elle Evensong (she/they): Elle arrived to Palisade along with the first wave of Devotees, making a name for herself as a cunning combatant and clever commander. In reality, they work for the Divine, Arbitrage as a double agent. Cori blames them for the death of her father. Pilot of the Cataphract. One of Arbitrage's remaining agents in the Twilight Mirage. General Tomorrow Mourning (she/her): Leader of the Qui'Err Coalition's forces en route to the Twilight Mirage. Gucci Garantine (she/her): A defector from Stel Kesh, who used the remaining wealth and power of House Brightline to help found Millennium Break. Currently a key member of the resistance efforts on Palisade, and a commander of Millenium Break forces there. Codename Watershed. Jesset City (he/him): After helping to kick off Millennium Break on Partizan, Jesset served as one of its major leaders during its expansion across the Principality. Now, he uses his talents in Hollow and Altar engineering, piloting, and cipher breaking on behalf of the Grey Pond unit of the cause. Still considers himself to be a member of the Party of the Wolf, though those designations have largely fallen from use. Mustard Red (she/her): A cyborg who once served as a member of Brink Proxy, with a speciality in surveillance. Joined the Cause during the Devotees expansion onto Palisade. The Witch in Glass a.k.a. Clementine Kesh (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the broken body of the Divine Past, which she has renamed the Reflecting Pool. Rules over the Crown of Glass, a city-state on the southeastern reaches of Palisade. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. Now broken with Perennial, she has become the egoist queen of the Iconoclasts. Lucia Whitestar (she/her): The young \"Lady Whitestar\" emerged as a strategic genius during the early conflict between Kesh and Apostolos on PARTIZAN five years ago. Daughter of the Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. Commands her forces from her flagship, the Lander One with the support of her combat AI, Fire Support (it/its). Partial Palisade (he/him): A man who was once a Divine, now living in the shell of a being quite unlike what he once was. Exenchester March (he/him): Founder of the Frontier Syndicate and the March Institute, former chair of the Zenith Fund. Betrayed the Pact and Stel Columnar, defecting to the Bilateral Intercession in exchange for territory on Palisade and the freedom to use it as he wishes. August Righteousness (he/they): Once, August served as the court chef of Joyous Guard. Now, he is the commander of Reunion, a Delegate resistance movement that is part of the Cause's Jade Kill unit, and one of the de facto most important leaders of the resistance on Palisade. Organizations The New Asterism: What was once a schism between Received and Progressive Asterism has now been healed by the false prophet Gur Sevraq (he/they), or at least someone in his name and face. The New Asterism claims that to be a citizen of the Principality is to have an obligation to \"better the world,\" in the sense that one invests in property or in the way that a settler \"rehabilitates\" or \"improves\" the places they claim by violence. If Received Asterism places virtue in the state and Progressive Asterism places it in the Divines, the New Asterism places it in the Principality's mythologized point of origin: The Twilight Mirage. Fabreal Duchy: When the Divine Principality left Palisade nearly 5,000 years ago, they left behind a Duke and his barons as caretakers. In the generations that followed, they ruled as petty tyrants, creating Delegates as their slaves, remaking their bodies into glass and oil, and extending their reach across Palisade's continents. Though they officially report to their handlers in Stel Kesh, recently they have begun to wonder if things were better before the Principality's return to Palisade. Places Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Temple of the Threshold: Built at the center of a massive bridge that crosses the Diadem, this serves as the home of New Asterism and its false prophet, The Twilight Mirage: Created over 5000 years ago by what was then the Divine Empyrean in an effort to protect the Divine Fleet, of which they were a member. The Mirage is a false nebula that obscures the position of its inhabitants both visually and by distorting time and space. Inside, there is now a vibrant and peaceful culture that spans eight planets, orbiting a dark and living Divine sun. Objects FS-N Dais: One of the Altars competing in the tournament, piltoed by Zjenta Zjarule (she/they) . Utilizes a special glass originally from the Twilight Mirage. AdArm Jury: The Jury is the future of AdArm machines. As the first design which fully moves beyond the platforms of the previous generation, it's a startling diversion from the bulky and boxy designs that the company is known for. In fact, the actual \"unit\" is only the cockpit, around which the rest of the Jury forms using concentrated Perennial Wave Material (PWM). Gone is the old LCD \"eye,\" replaced by a full pixel \"face\" that can send complex, laser-based communications silently to any other AdArm unit that can see it, as well as display iconographic messages to anyone nearby. A close study of the machine's curved and ovaline elements suggests that it has much in common with the Motion's Demiurgos design that AdArm salvaged as it does with the company's previous designs… Divines The Divine Future (they/them, it/its): An ancient divine, dating back to the second major war in the Golden Branch star sector. Exists in the form of golden orb slightly larger than a softball or bocce ball, which can either be carried by or hover around its Elect. Historically, it has been bidden to share its unparalleled perspective on the hopes and dreams of its chosen (and the endless vigor with which to pursue those goals). The Divine Integrity (it/its): Sometimes appearing as an articulated staff or a metallic spine, Integrity integrates itself into its chosen user. Once the two are connected, Integrity becomes a powerful exoskeleton, and supports its user in matters of military and morale. Until being assassinated by Brnine, Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, was the elect of Integrity. Now, it has found a new home in Thisbe. The Divine Motion (she/her): One of the founding members of the Pact, the necromantic Apostolosian divine once led its infamous retinue, the Black Century, on Partizan. They were defeated and dispersed, turned into part of Kalmeria, during Operation Shackled Sun. The Divine, Arbitrage (it/its): The amoral machine turned de facto treasurer keeps the Frontier Syndicate a step ahead in all matters of commerce. Sole minter of \"glint,\" a newly popular currency on Palisade. The Divine Crusade (they/them) : Leads Stel Nideo's occupation on Palisade along with their Elect, Gentian . Crusade is an enormous, bipedal machine covered (or perhaps made with) beautiful stained glass. Mysteries Volition (it/its): Sometimes called a Divine, sometiems called a \"post-Divine,\" this living orb sits at the center of the Quire system and the Twilight Molition. Sometimes a blistering sun, sometimes a glass-like moon, and often a mix of the two. It was originally built by the Iconoclasts, who believed that human subjectivity should be replaced by sublime purity of objective ideas. To this end, it began to produce Axioms, but eventually it learned to live more happily in relation to people and subjectivity in general. The Iconoclasts: Something beyond the human, desperate to eradicate subjectivity itself. After their messenger, the Usher of Truth, was delivered to The Witch in Glass, they have found themselves serving a new master. Axioms: Once, these beings were made by Volition as embodiments of particular ideals, supposedly detached from mortal perspective or subjectivity. Today, the vast majority of them are the emanation of one woman's ideals, given perfect, violent form. Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has bonded with elements of Autonomy Itself and the Divine Motion to create Kalmeria.

Few places changed as totally as Palisade, once just beyond the edge of the Twilight Mirage, now brought into orbit around the pseudo-sun of Volition as the new, ninth planet of the Quire System. And as above, so below: The change in the air is also a change in bodies, in minds, in matters military and social and even culinary. And parked below the newly painted skies of the Bontive Valley, the remaining crew of the Blue Channel ponders the future, reaching out to each other and beyond.

Still considers himself to be a member of the Party of the Wolf, though those designations have largely fallen from use. Mustard Red (she/her): A cyborg who once served as a member of Brink Proxy, with a speciality in surveillance. Joined the Cause during the Devotees expansion onto Palisade. Lucia Whitestar (she/her): The young \"Lady Whitestar\" emerged as a strategic genius during the early conflict between Kesh and Apostolos on PARTIZAN five years ago. Daughter of the Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. Commands her forces from her flagship, the Lander One with the support of her combat AI, Fire Support (it/its). Partial Palisade (he/him): A man who was once a Divine, now living in the shell of a being quite unlike what he once was. Organizations The New Asterism: What was once a schism between Received and Progressive Asterism has now been healed by the false prophet Gur Sevraq (he/they), or at least someone in his name and face. The New Asterism claims that to be a citizen of the Principality is to have an obligation to \"better the world,\" in the sense that one invests in property or in the way that a settler \"rehabilitates\" or \"improves\" the places they claim by violence. If Received Asterism places virtue in the state and Progressive Asterism places it in the Divines, the New Asterism places it in the Principality's mythologized point of origin: The Twilight Mirage. Places Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Temple of the Threshold: Built at the center of a massive bridge that crosses the Diadem, this serves as the home of New Asterism and its false prophet, The Twilight Mirage: Created over 5000 years ago by what was then the Divine Empyrean in an effort to protect the Divine Fleet, of which they were a member. The Mirage is a false nebula that obscures the position of its inhabitants both visually and by distorting time and space. Inside, there is now a vibrant and peaceful culture that spans eight planets, orbiting a dark and living Divine sun. Objects FS-N Dais: One of the Altars competing in the tournament, piltoed by Zjenta Zjarule (she/they) . Utilizes a special glass originally from the Twilight Mirage. AdArm Jury: The Jury is the future of AdArm machines. As the first design which fully moves beyond the platforms of the previous generation, it's a startling diversion from the bulky and boxy designs that the company is known for. In fact, the actual \"unit\" is only the cockpit, around which the rest of the Jury forms using concentrated Perennial Wave Material (PWM). Gone is the old LCD \"eye,\" replaced by a full pixel \"face\" that can send complex, laser-based communications silently to any other AdArm unit that can see it, as well as display iconographic messages to anyone nearby. A close study of the machine's curved and ovaline elements suggests that it has much in common with the Motion's Demiurgos design that AdArm salvaged as it does with the company's previous designs… Divines The Divine Future (they/them, it/its): An ancient divine, dating back to the second major war in the Golden Branch star sector. Exists in the form of golden orb slightly larger than a softball or bocce ball, which can either be carried by or hover around its Elect. Historically, it has been bidden to share its unparalleled perspective on the hopes and dreams of its chosen (and the endless vigor with which to pursue those goals). The Divine Integrity (it/its): Sometimes appearing as an articulated staff or a metallic spine, Integrity integrates itself into its chosen user. Once the two are connected, Integrity becomes a powerful exoskeleton, and supports its user in matters of military and morale. Until being assassinated by Brnine, Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, was the elect of Integrity. Now, it has found a new home in Thisbe. The Divine Motion (she/her): One of the founding members of the Pact, the necromantic Apostolosian divine once led its infamous retinue, the Black Century, on Partizan. They were defeated and dispersed, turned into part of Kalmeria, during Operation Shackled Sun. The Divine, Arbitrage (it/its): The amoral machine turned de facto treasurer keeps the Frontier Syndicate a step ahead in all matters of commerce. Sole minter of \"glint,\" a newly popular currency on Palisade. The Divine Crusade (they/them) : Leads Stel Nideo's occupation on Palisade along with their Elect, Gentian . Crusade is an enormous, bipedal machine covered (or perhaps made with) beautiful stained glass. Mysteries Axioms: Once, these beings were made by a so-called \"Post-Divine\" as embodiments of particular ideals, supposedly detached from mortal perspective or subjectivity. Today, the vast majority of them are the emanation of one woman's ideals, given perfect, violent form. Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has bonded with elements of Autonomy Itself and the Divine Motion to create Kalmeria.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for discussion of death, imprisonment, slavery, medical experimentation, and mind control. In the depths of the Temple of the Threshold, a moment passes, a hero dies, and the world begins to change. But Thisbe, Cori, and Brnine—standing in the heart of Exanceaster March's most advanced research facility—don't know that yet. But they do hear it coming. A mechanical whine in the air is about to become something else. Unfinished plans will be pushed into action. Tomorrow will come, faster for some than others. And life on Palisade will change forever. This week on PALISADE: A Mechanical Whine Pt. 4 Moon river / wider than a mile / I'm crossing you in style some day Dossier People Telford Stare (he/they): One of several foremen tied to the Lone Marble Group's contractor operations division. Crysanth Kesh (she/her): Mother of Clementine (a.k.a. The Witch in Glass). Once, third in line to the throne of Kesh and de facto leader of the Curtain of Divinity, the predecessor to the Bilateral Intelligence Service. Now dead. Organizations The Frontier Syndicate: A powerful conglomerate with a broad purview, including technology, heavy industry, entertainment, telecommunications, and transportation. Led by Exenceaster March (he/him) , the Syndicate betrayed the Pact of Free States and joined the Bilats in order to be part of their colonization efforts on Palisade. Developed the Altar, the predominant war machine of the current era. The Lone Marble Group: Built around a single artifact recovered from an Advent facility, this Frontier Syndicate subsidiary develops the future of Bilat war machinery. The Church of Received Asterism: The most widely practiced faith in the galaxy, and one of the earliest major organizations in the Divine Principality, created at the beginning of the Miraculous Millenium, over 3000 years ago. Teaches that Divines, the immortal machines and mechs that helped establish the Principality's hold on the galaxy, reflect the best aspects of the state itself. The divine Strength, in other words, is like a living flag of the Principality's own strength. Organized as a central church, led by a religious leader named a \"Cycle,\" whose will is enacted across the Principality by their many \"Songs,\" who rule worlds, star systems, or sometimes entire constellations. The Church of Progressive Asterism: Created as the teachings of the prophet Logos Kantel grew in popularity 1000 years ago, and made a secondary state religion in order to prevent a large schism. Teaches that Divines are true embodiments of their names, and that the citizens and states of the Principality should look to them as guiding stars. The Divine Strength, in other words, is a reflection of strength itself, or maybe \"god's strength,\" and we should aspire to make our strength look like the divine's. Unlike Received Asterism, there is no single central church, but hundreds of smaller sects, schools, and cults, each devoted to individual Divines, grouped sub-pantheons, or otherwise adjusted beliefs. The New Asterism: What was once a schism between Received and Progressive Asterism has now been healed by the false prophet Gur Sevraq (he/they), or at least someone in his name and face. The New Asterism claims that to be a citizen of the Principality is to have an obligation to \"better the world,\" in the sense that one invests in property or in the way that a settler \"rehabilitates\" or \"improves\" the places they claim by violence. If Received Asterism places virtue in the state and Progressive Asterism places it in the Divines, the New Asterism places it in the Principality's mythologized point of origin: The Twilight Mirage. Fabreal Duchy: When the Divine Principality left Palisade nearly 5,000 years ago, they left behind a Duke and his barons as caretakers. In the generations that followed, they ruled as petty tyrants, creating Delegates as their slaves, remaking their bodies into glass and oil, and extending their reach across Palisade's continents. Though they officially report to their handlers in Stel Kesh, recently they have begun to wonder if things were better before the Principality's return to Palisade. The Divine Collaborate: A successor state to the once vast Autonomous Diaspora, the Divine Collaborate wsa an eternally ad-hoc and temporary alliance of Divines, their pilots, and those under their protection. Defeated by the Divine Principality at the climax of the Divine Clash. In her original home timeline, Perennial belonged to some version of the Collaborate. Places Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Temple of the Threshold: Built at the center of a massive bridge that crosses the Diadem, this serves as the home of New Asterism and its false prophet, The Twilight Mirage: Created over 5000 years ago by what was then the Divine Empyrean in an effort to protect the Divine Fleet, of which they were a member.

As the first design which fully moves beyond the platforms of the previous generation, it's a startling diversion from the bulky and boxy designs that the company is known for. In fact, the actual \"unit\" is only the cockpit, around which the rest of the Jury forms using concentrated Perennial Wave Material (PWM).

A close study of the machine's curved and ovaline elements suggests that it has much in common with the Motion's Demiurgos design that AdArm salvaged as it does with the company's previous designs… AdArm Cast: This surveillance hollow, mostly used by Stel Nideo in the pre-Kalmeria Era, features angelic (and grotesque) features and focuses on observation, surveilliance, and communications. EDICT System : The E lectronic D ivine I nterface and C ontrol T echnology System was originally deployed during the Divine Clash, over 2400 years ago. Requires a great deal of power to activate, and needs to be transported by multiple large trucks, but when it is used, it can badly disrupt Divine activity--at least most of the time. There are many theories as to which Divines are affected and why, with many believing it is determined by provenance or era of Divine, some internal system of the EDICT itself, or even the current condition of the Perennial Wave. Divines The Divine Future (they/them, it/its): An ancient divine, dating back to the second major war in the Golden Branch star sector. Exists in the form of golden orb slightly larger than a softball or bocce ball, which can either be carried by or hover around its Elect. Historically, it has been bidden to share its unparalleled perspective on the hopes and dreams of its chosen (and the endless vigor with which to pursue those goals). The Divine Resonance (it/its): The watchful guardian, doting caregiver, and ardent supporter of Nideo's colonial efforts on Palisade. The Divine Integrity (it/its): Sometimes appearing as an articulated staff or a metallic spine, Integrity integrates itself into its chosen user. Once the two are connected, Integrity becomes a powerful exoskeleton, and supports its user in matters of military and morale. Until being assassinated by Brnine, Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, was the elect of Integrity. Now, it has found a new home in Thisbe. The Divine Motion (she/her): One of the founding members of the Pact, the necromantic Apostolosian divine once led its infamous retinue, the Black Century, on Partizan. They were defeated and dispersed, turned into part of Kalmeria, during Operation Shackled Sun. The Divine Opposition : One of many divines detained and experimented on by the nascent Divine Principality thousands of years ago, eventually becoming a source for the Fabreal Duchy's Delegates. Mysteries Axioms: Once, these beings were made by a so-called \"Post-Divine\" as embodiments of particular ideals, supposedly detached from mortal perspective or subjectivity. Today, the vast majority of them are the emanation of one woman's ideals, given perfect, violent form. Ebullience (it/its): An axiom retrieved by the Lone Marble Group. It holds a rounded, liquid metal form and moves with impossible to exhaust energy. Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has bonded with elements of Autonomy Itself and the Divine Motion to create Kalmeria.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for discussion of death, imprisonment, and slavery. At the center of the Lone Marble Group's main campus stands a corkscrew-shaped building with no name. A sphere slides down its long external groove, serving as sentry and, perhaps, more. Behind it: The secrets of Exanceaster March. At the center of Palisade's main continent stands a coliseum-shaped city that has been named a temple. Thousands flock to it in pilgrimage daily, a mocking replication of a different pilgrimage. Today, thousands extra make the walk, faith-eager. Inside: The future, and perhaps more.

If Received Asterism places virtue in the state and Progressive Asterism places it in the Divines, the New Asterism places it in the Principality's mythologized point of origin: The Twilight Mirage. Fabreal Duchy: When the Divine Principality left Palisade nearly 5,000 years ago, they left behind a Duke and his barons as caretakers. In the generations that followed, they ruled as petty tyrants, creating Delegates as their slaves, remaking their bodies into glass and oil, and extending their reach across Palisade's continents. Though they officially report to their handlers in Stel Kesh, recently they have begun to wonder if things were better before the Principality's return to Palisade. Places Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Temple of the Threshold: Built at the center of a massive bridge that crosses the Diadem, this serves as the home of New Asterism and its false prophet, The Twilight Mirage: Created over 5000 years ago by what was then the Divine Empyrean in an effort to protect the Divine Fleet, of which they were a member. The Mirage is a false nebula that obscures the position of its inhabitants both visually and by distorting time and space. Inside, there is now a vibrant and peaceful culture that spans eight planets, orbiting a dark and living Divine sun. Objects FS-N Dais: One of the Altars competing in the tournament, piltoed by Zjenta Zjarule (she/they) . Utilizes a special glass originally from the Twilight Mirage. AdArm Jury: The Jury is the future of AdArm machines. As the first design which fully moves beyond the platforms of the previous generation, it's a startling diversion from the bulky and boxy designs that the company is known for. In fact, the actual \"unit\" is only the cockpit, around which the rest of the Jury forms using concentrated Perennial Wave Material (PWM). Gone is the old LCD \"eye,\" replaced by a full pixel \"face\" that can send complex, laser-based communications silently to any other AdArm unit that can see it, as well as display iconographic messages to anyone nearby. A close study of the machine's curved and ovaline elements suggests that it has much in common with the Motion's Demiurgos design that AdArm salvaged as it does with the company's previous designs… Divines The Divine Resonance (it/its): The watchful guardian, doting caregiver, and ardent supporter of Nideo's colonial efforts on Palisade. The Divine Integrity (it/its): Sometimes appearing as an articulated staff or a metallic spine, Integrity integrates itself into its chosen user. Once the two are connected, Integrity becomes a powerful exoskeleton, and supports its user in matters of military and morale. Until being assassinated by Brnine, Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, was the elect of Integrity. Now, it has found a new home in Thisbe. The Divine Motion (she/her): One of the founding members of the Pact, the necromantic Apostolosian divine once led its infamous retinue, the Black Century, on Partizan. They were defeated and dispersed, turned into part of Kalmeria, during Operation Shackled Sun. Mysteries Axioms: Once, these beings were made by a so-called \"Post-Divine\" as embodiments of particular ideals, supposedly detached from mortal perspective or subjectivity. Today, they are the emanation of one woman's ideals, given perfect, violent form. But, perhaps, there are some of the original Axioms remaining in the galaxy...

      "description": "Across Palisade, Millennium Break and its allies launch into action. One after another, the Frontier Syndicate's egg-like power plants came under direct attack. With enough of them brought offline, the group's ploy to revive Motion would be halted—at least temporarily. That is where the Blue Channel would do their work: Infiltrate the campus of the Lone Marble Group; locate a kill switch for the terrible project; bring it all to a permanent end. This week on PALISADE: A Mechanical Whine Pt. 1 Blood on the horizon Dossier People Telford Stare (he/they): One of several foremen tied to the Lone Marble Group's contractor operations division. Organizations The Frontier Syndicate: A powerful conglomerate with a broad purview, including technology, heavy industry, entertainment, telecommunications, and transportation. Led by Exenceaster March (he/him) , the Syndicate betrayed the Pact of Free States and joined the Bilats in order to be part of their colonization efforts on Palisade. Developed the Altar, the predominant war machine of the current era. The Lone Marble Group: Built around a single artifact recovered from an Advent facility, this Frontier Syndicate subsidiary develops the future of Bilat war machinery. The Church of Received Asterism: The most widely practiced faith in the galaxy, and one of the earliest major organizations in the Divine Principality, created at the beginning of the Miraculous Millenium, over 3000 years ago. Teaches that Divines, the immortal machines and mechs that helped establish the Principality's hold on the galaxy, reflect the best aspects of the state itself. The divine Strength, in other words, is like a living flag of the Principality's own strength. Organized as a central church, led by a religious leader named a \"Cycle,\" whose will is enacted across the Principality by their many \"Songs,\" who rule worlds, star systems, or sometimes entire constellations. The Church of Progressive Asterism: Created as the teachings of the prophet Logos Kantel grew in popularity 1000 years ago, and made a secondary state religion in order to prevent a large schism. Teaches that Divines are true embodiments of their names, and that the citizens and states of the Principality should look to them as guiding stars. The Divine Strength, in other words, is a reflection of strength itself, or maybe \"god's strength,\" and we should aspire to make our strength look like the divine's. Unlike Received Asterism, there is no single central church, but hundreds of smaller sects, schools, and cults, each devoted to individual Divines, grouped sub-pantheons, or otherwise adjusted beliefs. The New Asterism: What was once a schism between Received and Progressive Asterism has now been healed by the false prophet Gur Sevraq (he/they), or at least someone in his name and face. The New Asterism claims that to be a citizen of the Principality is to have an obligation to \"better the world,\" in the sense that one invests in property or in the way that a settler \"rehabilitates\" or \"improves\" the places they claim by violence. If Received Asterism places virtue in the state and Progressive Asterism places it in the Divines, the New Asterism places it in the Principality's mythologized point of origin: The Twilight Mirage.

We apologize for having the show on delay for as long as we've had but a combination of scheduling + story . .. . . .. + production decisions hanging in the air means that releasing an episode today wouldn't be to our usual standard. We FULLY intend for there to be a new episode next Thursday!! If you ARE TTRPG hungry, we'll be doing a live stream this Monday at 6:30 Eastern on twitch.tv/friendsatthetable! There were also be a merch giveaway as we sort of test the system so it'll be a fun time!

      "description": "Aria Joie has a song stuck in her head. She knows all the lyrics. For a long time, whenever she thought of a song, she could hear the guide track too. Her own voice in her earpiece, peppy, encouraging, saying \"One fifteen BPM! One, two, three, four!\", counting her through the dance break. That's mostly faded away now. \"Open up my heart,\" she sings, and she folds a paper plate in half and puts it in the trash. \"Tear open up my heart!\" New job tomorrow. New colleagues. She's going into a casino to check out some CCT screw-up. She measures out a little pinch of fish food in her palm, and tips it into the tank by the door. A neon swirl. It's not \"open up my heart,\" is it? She's got the lyric wrong. Get a glass of water, Aria. Clear your head. She wishes she could open a window but there's no window in here. She pinches the bridge of her nose. \"Open up—\" what was it? How long has she been misremembering? Forget it. It's not important. She goes to the kiosk in the lobby. Gets a soda and a gacha toy. Taps her foot to the music in the elevator on the way back up. Big day tomorrow. Blackout. The arena goes silent. And then her voice, the first words spoken in the show. \"Do you believe in the power of love?\" Lightsticks, like a heart beat. \"Do you? Do you believe in the power of love?\" This week, on COUNTER/Weight 0.5: Thrilled Enough Listen to my heart!

      "description": "The robot didn't want to wear the hat: and that's fine. All you can do is try. All you can do is hack the machine that prints the hats and go skipping through it's kaleidoscopic innards. It's a wave of a hand. It's no time wasted, if there's such a thing as wasted time. They said that if you kept being late to class there'd be consequences, but you could access the registration computer from the rooftop of C block and look down at the campus and be exactly as late as you wanted. You could be terrifically late. It's a blink of an eye. And this is SO easy! The machine that prints the hats is easy, some squat little AI inside turning and looking at you, bleary-eyed. Goodbye! The security cameras all over this casino? Trivial. You can see a man about to spill his coffee. He's spilled his coffee. Down in custodial a pink LED clicks on. This is a casino? They store money here? But what would you spend the money on? So, the rent's due, but what are they going to do about that? Evict you? These are magic tricks. This is sleight of hand. Small fry don't get to see the real stuff. Once you made it to class on time and there was a box on your desk and right between then and the end of the period you spent 6 months in the dream of a dream of some glacial, oily thing. You rearranged planets in the sky between your thumb and index finger. The ocean in the shape of a ring. Click your fingers. It's cameras. Scrub through the footage. Pay attention, as much as you can. It's just a job: and that's fine. Hack the machine that prints the hats. Do what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life.

      "description": "Cass had not brought their big medical bag. There was the box in the ship, of course, with the mint-coloured lid and little trays, but their black bag hung where it always did: on a hook beside the door, back in Centralia. In the inside pocket of their jacket was a fabric pouch, folded over and sealed with velcro. A thin tube of medical sealant, a pair of needle-nose scissors, a flat spool of thread, antiseptic cream, gauze, and a small phial of epinephrine. They didn't need any more than that. As soon as Godlove's call came through and they watched him studiously, awkwardly walk through the briefing (each syllable of \"Ithikos\" carefully sounded, a furrowed, sympathetic brow with the mention of the revenants) they knew that they had been hired as a doctor second, and an Apostolisian first. Godlove probably expected them to \"work their contacts.\" They'd have contacts, of course, here in the Sill. No doubt. Among the casino family, or perhaps in the Agora. Perhaps an old friend from the war. That's how it worked. Find an old friend from the war, shake hands, smooth this over. Feel the connection. On a hook beside the door, back in Centralia, hung their medical bag. Below the supplies was a very fine layer of sand. The incendiary fire had fallen on the town across the bay and the whole fishing fleet had gone up like paper and they'd been told run, run, move your body and then the heat had hit them like July. There was also a shell in the shape of a pinwheel. This week on COUNTER/Weight 0.3: Under the Bus It's never too late to cash out!

      "description": "Sometimes, AuDy had found, people asked them to wait. This was transparently an exercise of power. Sit in there. I'll be right through. Flat silence as minutes passed. There existed a line of tension between one human and another and as one person wound it tauter and tauter - with distance, or silence, or an enforced period of waiting - certain useful anxieties would be sure to emerge in the other. The logic of this seemed sound to AuDy. On the other side of the room was a framed print of a man in the snow. He was lying on his back. A wire ran from the ceiling down to an outlet just above the floor, painted pale green. The top pin in the outlet carried electricity and the hexagonal grey one beneath it was a mesh hookup. For cleaning robots, and the like. The room was very quiet. What the people who asked AuDy to wait failed to understand was that the line they wound as they brewed coffee in a neighbouring room would never grow taut. They could wind and wind and AuDy, silent in the waiting room, tracing the wire up the wall, would unspool their patience with an easy comfort. One minute was one hour was one month was one second. Years later, just before the door opened, they remembered the man in the snow. He was lying on his back. This week on COUNTER/Weight 0.2: Valuable Connections What's your lucky number, Aria?

      "description": "By two o'clock in the morning, Orth Godlove of the Consolidated Counterweight Technocracy had chosen four names. Cassander Timaeus Berenice: an Apostolosian medic with a cool head and a noble background. They'd be able to use their connections, Orth thought. Speak with the Ithikos in a register others wouldn't. Then there was Mako Trig, some bright-eyed punk kid who claimed to be able to hack anything and everything. He'd dance through their security with a smile. The robot was a risk. Automated Dynamics' presence would raise questions, but if it came to it, Orth trusted that they would be nothing compact steel and ceramic couldn't answer. The last name on the list was a wildcard. He'd had to pull some strings, get some questions answered, make sure that this was the real deal. Aria Joie herself, the jewel in EarthHome's crown, now apparently turned freelancer on the desert planet. Whatever her motives, her legendary charisma and boundless optimism more than qualified her. There was a certain matter that needed to be cleared up - a corpse on a casino floor, a CCT manager in a cell. There were people down the hall who Orth knew would love nothing more than to roll in with the big guns, but things were… delicate. That'd be a disaster. No, it'd be these four. He'd already furnished them with a ship. He pinched the bridge of his nose. They'll be in and out. He made the call. This week on COUNTER/Weight 0.1: The First Bell Orth Godlove rolls the dice!

      "description": "Across the Bontive Valley, hardened members of the Cause join with recent recruits and regular civilians to kick off a region-wide celebration of their new liberation. Because it represents the first chance to publicly commemorate not only the group's most recent victory over the Bilateral Intercession, but also their recent victory over the Stellar Combustor and their success in taking the Grav Train), it is a loud, boisterous, and sprawling party. There, in the town of Eversin, the crew of the Blue Channel joins in with the celebration. Who will they bump into? What new memories might they make? This week on PALISADE: Reach In / Reach Out Pt. 2 Sing where the other boys can watch you dance Dossier People Midnite Matinee (she/her): Leporine scout and member of the Blue Channel. She and her trusty Pack-model light AutoHollow Popcorn used to run a repo company, but now are tentatively committed to the Cause and Millennium Break. Elle Evensong (she/they): Elle arrived to Palisade along with the first wave of Devotees, making a name for herself as a cunning combatant and clever commander. She became a poster child for Twilight Mirage's support of Palisade (and, for members of the Dim Liturgy, a prophesied bridge between the past and the future). But as the war began to heat up, she seemed to vanish into the background. In fact, they were working for the Divine, Arbitrage as a double agent. Cori blames them for the death of her father. Pilot of the Cataphract. Murchy \"Murch\" Saltburn (she/her) : A gig-cop working for Lock & Cross Security Services in Baseline-C. Alise Breka (she/her): Once, Alise was most popular for her Renegade Hearts books of daring pulp adventure. Now she is one of the chief propagandists of Millennium Break, turning their struggles (and victories) into novels, screenplays, and other media. Gucci Garantine (she/her): A defector from Stel Kesh, who used the remaining wealth and power of House Brightline to help found Millennium Break. Currently a key member of the resistance efforts on Palisade, and a commander of Millenium Break forces there. Codename Watershed. Jesset City (he/him): After helping to kick off Millennium Break on Partizan, Jesset served as one of its major leaders during its expansion across the Principality. Now, he uses his talents in Hollow and Altar engineering, piloting, and cipher breaking on behalf of the Grey Pond unit of the cause. Still considers himself to be a member of the Party of the Wolf, though those designations have largely fallen from use. Mustard Red (she/her): A cyborg who once served as a member of Brink Proxy, with a speciality in surveillance. Joined the Cause during the Devotees expansion onto Palisade. Organizations Bilateral Intercession: One of two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, comprised by Stels Kesh and Nideo, and lead by the so-called Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh (he/him), who took control of the faction from the Curtain, a secretive intelligence organization with roots in Kesh's ancient spy operations. The \"Bilats\" are a conservative and reactionary force, aiming to return the Principality to its roots both literally and figuratively. After a long campaign against the Pact of Free States, they managed to take control of Palisade. Rose River: Though they are undoubtedly committed to the Cause, this unique research unit (combining Veronique (she/her), her Divine Fealty (any pronouns), and their followers with an out-of-time NEH Sleep Detachment squad) hope for a day when they can be something other than soldiers. Jade Kill: Based in Joyous Guard, this military arm of the Cause is operated by the Delegate liberation faction known as Reunion and supported by Kalar Anakalar's (he/him) Giantkiller unit and a wing of Swordbreakers. Led by August Righteousness (he/him). Violet Cove: The Dim Liturgy claim to have seen the Divine Devotion's arrival coming in their sacred text: A battered and corrupted backup of Crystal Palace's final predictions for the future. Now the two cults work together to oust the Bilats... and perhaps to do more intriguing things, as well. Grey Pond: With members of the Oxblood Clan, the Company of the Spade, and the Shale Belt's Concrete Front, these blue collar revolutionaries are experts at getting the Cause the equipment it needs (and maintaining what it has when that's the only available option). Carmine Bight: From ramshackle additions to the rocky shores of Rifle Island, Captain Skelton Knaggs (he/him) and his fearsome flotilla launch rusted pirate vessels beneath the waves, guided by a coalition of Hyphan navigators. The Twill: Though many groups have lived on the world of Palisade over the years, the Twill can trace their time on the world back the furthest. Though a first glance appraisal might make one think that their defining trait is the moss that covers much of their bodies and allows them to live on sunlight and water alone, in fact their most unshakable cultural trait is a practice of collaboration, aid, and acceptance. When groups like Advent, Kesh, the New Earth Hegemony, and the Divine Principality left Palisade behind, they often left behind the disaffected or unwanted. It was often, if not always, the Twill who helped these people find sustainable lives on the world, either by blending with the group over generations or through open exchange of goods and information. The Frontier Syndicate: A powerful conglomerate with a broad purview, including technology, heavy industry, entertainment, telecommunications, and transportation. Led by Exenceaster March (he/him), the Syndicate betrayed the Pact of Free States and joined the Bilats in order to be part of their colonization efforts on Palisade. The New Asterism: What was once a schism between Received and Progressive Asterism has now been healed by the false prophet Gur Sevraq (he/they), or at least someone in his name and face. The New Asterism claims that to be a citizen of the Principality is to have an obligation to \"better the world,\" in the sense that one invests in property or in the way that a settler \"rehabilitates\" or \"improves\" the places they claim by violence. Places Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Divines The Divine Filigree: The instrumentalized operating core of Palisade's extensive GravTrain system. Recovered by the Blue Channel and turned over to the Cause's leadership. The Divine Motion (she/her): One of the founding members of the Pact, the necromantic Apostolosian divine once led its infamous retinue, the Black Century, on Partizan. They were defeated and dispersed, turned into part of Kalmeria, during Operation Shackled Sun. The Divine, Arbitrage (it/its): The amoral machine turned de facto treasurer keeps the Frontier Syndicate a step ahead in all matters of commerce. Sole minter of \"glint,\" a newly popular currency on Palisade. The Divine Crusade (they/them) : Leads Stel Nideo's occupation on Palisade along with their Elect, Gentian . Crusade is an enormous, bipedal machine covered (or perhaps made with) beautiful stained glass. Asepsis (it/its): The final living remnants of a Divine who pursues its particular vision of purity at the cost of everything else. Kept, studied, and utilized by Captain Kalvin Brnine. Additional Notes Delegates : In plain terms, Delegates are synthetic individuals created through a process of forcible extraction from a living Divine. Originated by the Fabreal Duchy, who were left behind to \"attend to\" Palisade by the Divine Principality around 5000 years ago, these Delgates were designed and used as slaves. Currently, a Delegate resistance group called Reunion operates out of the fortress Joyous Guard in the Caldera Stretch.

      "description": "The dominos have begun to fall. Across Palisade, the Cause's efforts have begun to be rewarded. And soon, its members will reward themselves with celebrations across the Bontive Valley. But, at least for the crew of the Blue Channel, it is not \"soon\" yet. Before they can party, they have some open issues that must be addressed. A visitor at the door. A hand on a scepter. An unclear connection to the divine. This week on PALISADE: Reach In / Reach Out Pt. 1 Words are blunt instruments / Words are sawn-off shotguns Dossier People Lucia Whitestar (she/her): The young \"Lady Whitestar\" emerged as a strategic genius during the early conflict between Kesh and Apostolos on PARTIZAN five years ago. Daughter of the Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. Commands her forces from her flagship, the Lander One with the support of her combat AI, Fire Support (it/its). Partial Palisade (he/him): A man who was once a Divine, now living in the shell of a being quite unlike what he once was. Murchy \"Murch\" Saltburn (she/her): A gig-cop working for Lock & Cross Security Services in Baseline-C. Alise Breka (she/her): Once, Alise was most popular for her Renegade Hearts books of daring pulp adventure. Now she is one of the chief propagandists of Millennium Break, turning their struggles (and victories) into novels, screenplays, and other media. Factions Stel Nideo: Created the largest faith in the empire, and used that influence to shape (and surveil) mass culture. They are tied to the Present. Faith, coercion, stability. Places Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Divines The Divine Filigree: The instrumentalized operating core of Palisade's extensive GravTrain system. Recovered by the Blue Channel and turned over to the Cause's leadership. The Divine Integrity (it/its) : Sometimes appearing as an articulated staff or a metallic spine, Integrity integrates itself into its chosen user. Once the two are connected, Integrity becomes a powerful exoskeleton, and supports its user in matters of military and morale. Until being assassinated by Brnine, Dahlia (they/them) , the Glorious Princept, was the elect of Integrity. In an ancient era, Sokrates Nikon Artemisios (they/them) was the \"candidate\" (user) of Integrity, and together they reformed the Apostolosian Empire, turning it into the Golden Branch Demarchy for some time. Mysteries Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has recently bonded with Kalmeria.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for discussion of civilian casualties. On Palisade, it seems as if possibility has begun to bloom. The Stellar Combustor has been deactivated. The Grav Trains that run through the Diadem and across the planet have come under revolutionary control. The Bilateral Intelligence Service lies in shambles. But Stel Kesh is not done, yet. This week on PALISADE: Weapons Ready Pt. 2 Tell me, tell me / Will you still enjoy the view / Through the smoke into the blue Dossier People Gentian (she/her): Elect of the Divine Crusade. Impossibly old, yet a source of power and vibrance.

Rules over the Crown of Glass, a city-state on the southeastern reaches of Palisade. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. Haunted by an old foe. Riah Connadine (he/him) : Commander of the Bilateral Intelligence Service on Palisade. An expert in psychological operations and folklore. As a composer, his opus is the Adagio, a plan to get everyone on Palisade operating in ways not only predictable, but scripted. As a conductor, his orchestra now turns towards the second movement. Rudy Smails (he/him): Member of Millennium Break who often spends his free time in the Crown of Glass, hanging with the boys.

Sole minter of \"glint,\" a newly popular currency on Palisade. The Divine Integrity (it/its) : Sometimes appearing as an articulated staff or a metallic spine, Integrity integrates itself into its chosen user. Once the two are connected, Integrity becomes a powerful exoskeleton, and supports its user in matters of military and morale. Until being assassinated by Brnine, Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, was the elect of Integrity. The Divine Crusade (they/them): Leads Stel Nideo's occupation on Palisade along with their Elect, Gentian. Crusade is an enormous, bipedal machine covered (or perhaps made with) beautiful stained glass. Additional Notes Delegates: In plain terms, Delegates are synthetic individuals created through a process of forcible extraction from a living Divine. Originated by the Fabreal Duchy, who were left behind to \"attend to\" Palisade by the Divine Principality around 5000 years ago, these Delgates were designed and used as slaves. Currently, a Delegate resistance group called Reunion operates out of the fortress Joyous Guard in the Caldera Stretch.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for death, the description of corpses, false memories, illusions, vomiting, and medical experimentation. Where has the crew of the Blue Channel gone? For Eclectic Opposition, the answer is easy, if dire: In the passenger seat of a Baseline-C security vehicle, under the watchful eyes of the Divine Resonance, scrambling for a way out. For the support staff, like Hunting Tomorrow and Partial Palisade, the answer is scanning for the others. And those others? They are so close—under five miles away from the ship's landing zone—yet so, so far. Deep in the Catacombs of Dust. Deeper, still, living new lives, considering what might be, what might have been, and what yet might still come. This week on PALISADE: Seize the Chance Pt. 5 Let loose the wide world that holds you / Scratch through / Your waves linger Dossier People Partial Palisade (he/him): A man who was once a Divine, now living in the shell of a being quite unlike what he once was. Midnite Matinee (she/her): Leporine scout and member of the Blue Channel. She and her trusty Pack-model light AutoHollow Popcorn used to run a repo company, but now are tentatively committed to the Cause and Millennium Break. Elle Evensong (she/they): Elle arrived to Palisade along with the first wave of Devotees, making a name for herself as a cunning combatant and clever commander. She became a poster child for Twilight Mirage's support of Palisade (and, for members of the Dim Liturgy, a prophesied bridge between the past and the future). But as the war began to heat up, she seemed to vanish into the background. In fact, they were working for the Divine, Arbitrage as a double agent. Cori blames them for the death of her father. Pilot of the Cataphract. Murchy \"Murch\" Saltburn (she/her): A gig-cop working for Lock & Cross Security Services in Baseline-C. Alise Breka (she/her): Once, Alise was most popular for her Renegade Hearts books of daring pulp adventure. Now she is one of the chief propagandists of Millennium Break, turning their struggles (and victories) into novels, screenplays, and other media. Factions Bilateral Intercession: One of two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, comprised by Stels Kesh and Nideo, and lead by the so-called Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh (he/him) , who took control of the faction from the Curtain, a secretive intelligence organization with roots in Kesh's ancient spy operations. The \"Bilats\" are a conservative and reactionary force, aiming to return the Principality to its roots both literally and figuratively. After a long campaign against the Pact of Free States, they managed to take control of Palisade. The Bilateral Intelligence Service: Formerly called the Curtain, the BIS is a Kesh-operated organization which specializes in espionage, subterfuge, and surveillance. Recently removed from power on Palisade Stel Kesh: The oldest established power in the galaxy, built around a stuffy (and secretive) aristocracy. They are tied to the Past. History, knowledge, stubbornness. Stel Nideo: Created the largest faith in the empire, and used that influence to shape (and surveil) mass culture. They are tied to the Present. Faith, coercion, stability. The Frontier Syndicate: A powerful conglomerate with a broad purview, including technology, heavy industry, entertainment, telecommunications, and transportation. Led by Exenceaster March (he/him) , the Syndicate betrayed the Pact of Free States and joined the Bilats in order to be part of their colonization efforts on Palisade. The Pact of Free States: One of the two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, a joint operation by Stels Columnar and Apostolos. Led in name by the Glorious Princept, Dahlia (they/them), but operated in day-to-day matters by members of the original Pact of Necessary Venture, including Rye (he/him) and Gallica (she/her). Though they are reformist in some ways, their primary goal is greater autonomy for each Stel, freedom from the legal restraints, taxes, and oversights demanded by the Principality, with additional deregulation to follow downstream. Fabreal Duchy: When the Divine Principality left Palisade nearly 5,000 years ago, they left behind a Duke and his barons as caretakers. In the generations that followed, they ruled as petty tyrants, creating Delegates as their slaves, remaking their bodies into glass and oil, and extending their reach across Palisade's continents. Though they officially report to their handlers in Stel Kesh, recently they have begun to wonder if things were better before the Principality's return to Palisade. Places Diadem Gravtrain: While the vast trench-city on Palisade's equator lays abandoned, Kesh has reactivated its railway via an operations center in the city of Carmathen . Collier: The agricultural world where Thisbe was dug up and eventually sold to mercenaries. A planet that, due to the Farmer's Rebellion, was removed from all Principality maps and effectively abandoned. Became the \"breadbasket\" of Millennium Break, a farming world to support the revolutionary movement. Divines The Divine Filigree: The instrumentalized operating core of Palisade's extensive GravTrain system. Currently being taken into Dust's catacombs by the affliction's minions. The Divine Motion (she/her): One of the founding members of the Pact, the necromantic Apostolosian divine once led its infamous retinue, the Black Century, on Partizan. They were defeated and dispersed, turned into part of Kalmeria, during Operation Shackled Sun. The Divine, Arbitrage (it/its): The amoral machine turned de facto treasurer keeps the Frontier Syndicate a step ahead in all matters of commerce. Sole minter of \"glint,\" a newly popular currency on Palisade. The Divine Integrity (it/its): Sometimes appearing as an articulated staff or a metallic spine, Integrity integrates itself into its chosen user. Once the two are connected, Integrity becomes a powerful exoskeleton, and supports its user in matters of military and morale. Until being assassinated by Brnine, Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, was the elect of Integrity. The Divine Resonance (it/its): The watchful guardian, doting caregiver, and ardent supporter of Nideo's colonial efforts on Palisade. Asepsis (it/its): The final living remnants of a Divine who pursues its particular vision of purity at the cost of everything else. Kept, studied, and utilized by Captain Kalvin Brnine. Objects The Broken Spoke: The Figure's bipedal and asymmetrical mech, The Broken Spoke is made of a matte crystaline material that has Russian Sage seemingly sprouting out between its joints. It has stout legs. Its right arm carries a glaive; its left \"arm\", or what would pass as such, is an oversized cannon with an attached shield. This oversized half of the mech is covered by a flowing cloak. BAC Hatchets: Appearing like fantastical knights made of tooth enamel, the Divine Consecration's latest machine of war, derived from parts recovered from the Divines Felicity and Souciance, buried inside of Chimera's Lantern. The Hatchets wield axes that sport long, weaponized chains running from the bottom of their hafts, and the materials used in their construciton make them sturdier than most front line units. The trio of Hatchets deployed by Stel Nideo to capture the \"train brain\" are piloted by three brothers: Calamedes, Caspin, and Caydor. Saint: A series of mechs piloted by knights that served the original Crown of Glass, a major power on the pre-Divine Principality-era Twilight Mirage world of Quire. Mysteries Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has recently bonded with Kalmeria. The Five Afflictions: A group of \"monstrous\" beings that haunt the dark corners of Palisade. They have been named as follows: Dust a.k.a Pride's Mirror a.k.a. The Looking Glass Refrain a.k.a. Yesterday's Reprise a.k.a. The Ghastly Chorus Ravel a.k.a. Labyrinth's Thread a.k.a. The Hedge Maze Cleave a.k.a. Whetstone's Opposite a.k.a. The Sanguine Hatchet Oversight a.k.a. Hell's Facade a.k.a. The Empty Garden Flash Nautilus: An alien creature who uses plasma-energy for propulsion. Compelled into service by Stel Nideo. Additional Notes Delegates: In plain terms, Delegates are synthetic individuals created through a process of forcible extraction from a living Divine. Originated by the Fabreal Duchy, who were left behind to \"attend to\" Palisade by the Divine Principality around 5000 years ago, these Delgates were designed and used as slaves.

      "description": "Standing astride the Diadem, the massive Affliction called Dust first sapped sound from the world and then turned its attention to the train car at the center of a multi-factional chase.

Fabreal Duchy: When the Divine Principality left Palisade nearly 5,000 years ago, they left behind a Duke and his barons as caretakers. In the generations that followed, they ruled as petty tyrants, creating Delegates as their slaves, remaking their bodies into glass and oil, and extending their reach across Palisade's continents. Though they officially report to their handlers in Stel Kesh, recently they have begun to wonder if things were better before the Principality's return to Palisade. Places Diadem Gravtrain: While the vast trench-city on Palisade's equator lays abandoned, Kesh has reactivated its railway via an operations center in the city of Carmathen . The Paint Shop: Sitting atop the central peak of Steeple Catterick, this faux-commune was once the central HQ of the Bilateral HQ on Palisade. Now it has gone quiet. Divines The Divine Motion (she/her): One of the founding members of the Pact, the necromantic Apostolosian divine once led its infamous retinue, the Black Century, on Partizan. They were defeated and dispersed, turned into part of Kalmeria, during Operation Shackled Sun. The Divine, Arbitrage (it/its): The amoral machine turned de facto treasurer keeps the Frontier Syndicate a step ahead in all matters of commerce. Sole minter of \"glint,\" a newly popular currency on Palisade. The Divine Integrity (it/its): Sometimes appearing as an articulated staff or a metallic spine, Integrity integrates itself into its chosen user. Once the two are connected, Integrity becomes a powerful exoskeleton, and supports its user in matters of military and morale. Until being assassinated by Brnine, Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, was the elect of Integrity. The Divine Resonance (it/its): The watchful guardian, doting caregiver, and ardent supporter of Nideo's colonial efforts on Palisade. Asepsis (it/its): The final living remnants of a Divine who pursues its particular vision of purity at the cost of everything else. Kept, studied, and utilized by Captain Kalvin Brnine. Objects The Broken Spoke: The Figure's bipedal and asymmetrical mech, The Broken Spoke is made of a matte crystaline material that has Russian Sage seemingly sprouting out between its joints. It has stout legs. Its right arm carries a glaive; its left \"arm\", or what would pass as such, is an oversized cannon with an attached shield. This oversized half of the mech is covered by a flowing cloak. BAC Hatchets: Appearing like fantastical knights made of tooth enamel, the Divine Consecration's latest machine of war, derived from parts recovered from the Divines Felicity and Souciance, buried inside of Chimera's Lantern. The Hatchets wield axes that sport long, weaponized chains running from the bottom of their hafts, and the materials used in their construciton make them sturdier than most front line units. The trio of Hatchets deployed by Stel Nideo to capture the \"train brain\" are piloted by three brothers: Calamedes, Caspin, and Caydor. Saint: A series of mechs piloted by knights that served the original Crown of Glass, a major power on the pre-Divine Principality-era Twilight Mirage world of Quire. Mysteries Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has recently bonded with Kalmeria. The Five Afflictions: A group of \"monstrous\" beings that haunt the dark corners of Palisade. They have been named as follows: Dust a.k.a Pride's Mirror a.k.a. The Looking Glass Refrain a.k.a. Yesterday's Reprise a.k.a. The Ghastly Chorus Ravel a.k.a. Labyrinth's Thread a.k.a. The Hedge Maze Cleave a.k.a. Whetstone's Opposite a.k.a. The Sanguine Hatchet Oversight a.k.a. Hell's Facade a.k.a. The Empty Garden Flash Nautilus: An alien creature who uses plasma-energy for propulsion. Compelled into service by Stel Nideo. Additional Notes Delegates: In plain terms, Delegates are synthetic individuals created through a process of forcible extraction from a living Divine. Originated by the Fabreal Duchy, who were left behind to \"attend to\" Palisade by the Divine Principality around 5000 years ago, these Delgates were designed and used as slaves. Currently, a Delegate resistance group called Reunion operates out of the fortress Joyous Guard in the Caldera Stretch.

      "description": "In the city of Carmathen, the Fabreal Duchy has spread itself too thin. Look only at the entrance to the Diadem Grav Train's control center: Once guarded by a full detachment of Stel Kesh's most reliable soldiers. Now, guarded by little more than an honor guard. On a world like Palisade, in a war like this one, it may as well be an invitation. The question is only how many might decide to come calling. This week on PALISADE: Seize the Chance Pt. 2 somewhere beneath the pale / moonlight, there is past / under the same sky Dossier People Partial Palisade (he/him): A man who was once a Divine, now living in the shell of a being quite unlike what he once was. Connadine (he/him): Commander of the Bilateral Intelligence Service on Palisade. An expert in psychological operations and folklore. As a composer, his opus is the Adagio, a plan to get everyone on Palisade operating in ways not only predictable, but scripted. As a conductor, his orchestra now turns towards the second movement. Midnite Matinee (she/her): Leporine scout and member of the Blue Channel. She and her trusty Pack-model light AutoHollow Popcorn used to run a repo company, but now are tentatively committed to the Cause and Millennium Break. Gucci Garantine (she/her): A defector from Stel Kesh, who used the remaining wealth and power of House Brightline to help found Millennium Break. Currently a key member of the resistance efforts on Palisade, and a commander of Millenium Break forces there. Codename Watershed. Factions Bilateral Intercession: One of two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, comprised by Stels Kesh and Nideo, and lead by the so-called Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh (he/him) , who took control of the faction from the Curtain, a secretive intelligence organization with roots in Kesh's ancient spy operations. The \"Bilats\" are a conservative and reactionary force, aiming to return the Principality to its roots both literally and figuratively. After a long campaign against the Pact of Free States, they managed to take control of Palisade. The Bilateral Intelligence Service: Formerly called the Curtain, the BIS is a Kesh-operated organization which specializes in espionage, subterfuge, and surveillance. Recently removed from power on Palisade Stel Kesh: The oldest established power in the galaxy, built around a stuffy (and secretive) aristocracy. They are tied to the Past. History, knowledge, stubbornness. Stel Nideo: Created the largest faith in the empire, and used that influence to shape (and surveil) mass culture. They are tied to the Present. Faith, coercion, stability. The Frontier Syndicate: A powerful conglomerate with a broad purview, including technology, heavy industry, entertainment, telecommunications, and transportation. Led by Exenceaster March (he/him) , the Syndicate betrayed the Pact of Free States and joined the Bilats in order to be part of their colonization efforts on Palisade. The Pact of Free States: One of the two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, a joint operation by Stels Columnar and Apostolos. Led in name by the Glorious Princept, Dahlia (they/them), but operated in day-to-day matters by members of the original Pact of Necessary Venture, including Rye (he/him) and Gallica (she/her).

Objects AdArm Bouquet: Designed by Stel Orion's Adamant Arms and Artifice as an Altar-era update to the classic Troop design. It's still boxy (if a little trimmer) and it retains it's wide, rectangular \"eye\" on its head. Gone are the heavy grip claws, replaced with traditional, five-fingered hands, allowing it more complex manipulations, including the operations of its distinctive Roundless Rifle, which seems convert raw Perennial Wave into ammunition. Additionally, the shoulder mount has ditched the heavy cannon in exchange for a close range, pneumatic lance that can devastate even the strongest armor. Roundless rifles fire condensed Perennial Wave gathered from the atmosphere itself.

      "description": "There is, apparently, no time for rest. An opportunity emerges: With Kesh in chaos on the planet and Nideo not yet in proper posture, the Grav Trains which run through the Diadem and which vein across Palisade's continents could be brought under Millennium Break control.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for imprisonment, withholding medical care, civilian deaths, medical experiments, blood, description of injury, and death, \"What sort of shape is it though?\" \"It is empire.\" \"Yes, no, I get that, but... Is empire a square? Is it circle? It helps to know the shape of a thing if you're hoping to break it.\" \"Yes. I understand. You tell me, then. What shape do you think empire takes? Perhaps you can see it in a way I cannot, because you first apprehended it from outside.\" \"Well, I can't tell you about all empires, but this one? It wants to be fractal. Each stel tries to make everything inside of it a repetition of itself.\" \"Yes. Yes, I see. Stel Apostolos shapes itself as a spear, and so it extends downward in echoing cacophony. Its military bases, its schools, its students, its children—all spears.\" \"Yeah, something like that. The trouble is, a fractal is really strong. All those shapes, repeated inwards forever. They flex, like a tree's branches bending in the wind.\" \"Yes, but that is it. The Principality is not an abstract fractal, repeating forever. It is a tree. And a tree repeats only for so long.\" \"And when a strong enough wind blows…\" \"It can be uprooted.\" This week on PALISADE: Honesty and Integrity Pt. 2 I grieve in stereo, the stereo sounds strange / You know that if it hides, it doesn't go away Dossier People Routine Rennari (he/him): Half-Apostolsian, scion of a minor Kesh noble house, and the Blue Channel's heavy. Partial Palisade (he/him): A man who was once a Divine, now living in the shell of a being quite unlike what he once was. Eclectic Opposition (he/him): A delegate and member of the Cause who left Palisade to spend time working under Exeter Leap before returning to his home planet to investigate the strange factories being built by the Frontier Syndicate. Gallica (she/her) : Elect of the Divine Present. Gallica spent years as Chief Emissary of Stel Nideo, Verse (missionary) in the Holy Church of Received Asterism, but in fact was a signatory to the Pact of Necessary Venture, and when the war spilled beyond Kesh and Apostolos, Gallica betrayed her home Stel to join Apostolos and Nideo. Currently, she leads high level intelligence and espionage operations for the Pact of Free States. The Glorious Princept, Dahlia (they/them): The second pretender to the title of Princept. Born to house Kesh, Dahlia was once kidnapped by a rebelious Sovereign Immunity known as the Farmer. After being rescued and raised by the then Apokine of Stel Apostolos, they integrated into Apostolosian culture. Though they were not part of the Pact of Necessary Venture at its founding, they welcomed the group's support, though focused their efforts on the war with the Branched instead of the ongoing civil conflict. Cas'alear Rizah (cas/cas', they/them): Leader of the Swordbreakers, an elite unit of Apostolosian-trained pilots who have since sworn service to Millenium Break. Cas holds a reputation for beauty and bravery among allies, but is seen as unflinching and unpredictable by cas' foes.. Factions The Frontier Syndicate: A powerful conglomerate with a broad purview, including technology, heavy industry, entertainment, telecommunications, and transportation. Led by Exenceaster March (he/him), the Syndicate betrayed the Pact of Free States and joined the Bilats in order to be part of their colonization efforts on Palisade. The Pact of Free States: One of the two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, a joint operation by Stels Columnar and Apostolos. Led in name by the Glorious Princept, Dahlia (they/them), but operated in day-to-day matters by members of the original Pact of Necessary Venture, including Rye (he/him) and Gallica (she/her). Though they are reformist in some ways, their primary goal is greater autonomy for each Stel, freedom from the legal restraints, taxes, and oversights demanded by the Principality, with additional deregulation to follow downstream. STEREOMA: Pact truebeliver Cor'rina Corrine (cor/cors, they/them) and cor rival Misericorde (he/they) have begun building a surgical, anti-Bilat hit squad on Paliade. Places Diadem Gravtrain: While the vast trench-city on Palisade's equator lays abandoned, Kesh has reactivated its railway via an operations center in Carmathen. Divines The Divine Motion (she/her): One of the founding members of the Pact, the necromantic Apostolosian divine once led its infamous retinue, the Black Century, on Partizan. They were defeated and dispersed, turned into part of Kalmeria, during Operation Shackled Sun. Present (it/its): On first blush, Present might be confused for a small, if luxurious frigate. And sometimes, it is just that: Its oval structure houses living quarters, a humble armory, enough cargo space to hold a single hollow, and even a fully stocked bar. But at a snap of its elect's fingers, it transforms into a humanoid war machine that serves its elect loyally, outclasses any Altar currently in operation, and is capable of holding its own against many other Divines in combat. The Divine Commitment (it/its): A malleable divine made of inky black metal. Has historically required two pilots (both in a condition of ego death) in order to be operated, its current Elect is the Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, who operates it with the aid of the Divine Integrity. The Divine Integrity (it/its): Sometimes appearing as an articulated staff or a metallic spine, Integrity integrates itself into its chosen user. Once the two are connected, Integrity becomes a powerful exoskeleton, and supports its user in matters of military and morale. Currently, Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, is the elect of Integrity. Objects Ekpyrosis: Flagship of the Pact's fleet, a transforming, beautiful monstrosity able to casually destroy worlds while simultaneously supporting life in a vacuum. Mysteries Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has recently bonded with Kalmeria.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for imprisonment, withholding medical care, chemical warfare and civilian casualties. The Blue Channel orbits Palisade unhelmed, one of its members sacrificed and two under lock and key in the brig of a ship hiding in the darkness beyond the system's fringe. Nevertheless, the Blue Channel's remaining crew attempt to get back to work—and there is work to do, as their allies on the planet below have suffered from Bilateral retaliation. Plus, there is the matter of the new factories popping up across the planet: A new mystery waiting to be investigated… This week on PALISADE: Honesty and Integrity Pt. 1 They got the devil hidin' in plain sight Dossier People Continental Countinghouse (he/him): Former host of the Stel Orion-broadcast panel show \"CENTER/Line\". Now host of the most watched interview show in the Principality, \"Five Stels, Five Questions\". Routine Rennari (he/him): Half-Apostolsian, scion of a minor Kesh noble house, and the Blue Channel's heavy. Partial Palisade (he/him): A man who was once a Divine, now living in the shell of a being quite unlike what he once was. Eclectic Opposition (he/him): A delegate and member of the Cause who left Palisade to spend time working under Exeter Leap before returning to his home planet to investigate the strange factories being built by the Frontier Syndicate Captain Jev'ari Estano (jev/jev, they/them): Commander of Onyx Squadron and captain of the Stolen Cameo, the Pact ship holding Brnine and Routine. Aleel Verdicate (she/her): Song of Partizan, making her the de facto head of the Church of Received Asterism on the moon. Particular Emphasis a.k.a. Parti (she/her): Member of Reunion on loan to Grey Pond's communication and outreach division. One time protégé of Black Screen. Factions The Bilateral Intelligence Service: Formerly called the Curtain, the BIS is a Kesh-operated organization which specializes in espionage, subterfuge, and surveillance. Though it is as secretive as ever, it is no longer the true source of power in Kesh territory. Instead, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh (he/him) has modernized its structure and operation, and has ensured that it remains well integrated into the Bilateral Intercession's greater workings—as to better keep one eye on them. The Frontier Syndicate: A powerful conglomerate with a broad purview, including technology, heavy industry, entertainment, telecommunications, and transportation. Led by Exenceaster March (he/him), the Syndicate betrayed the Pact of Free States and joined the Bilats in order to be part of their colonization efforts on Palisade. The Pact of Free States: One of the two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, a joint operation by Stels Columnar and Apostolos. Led in name by the Glorious Princept, Dahlia (they/them), but operated in day-to-day matters by members of the original Pact of Necessary Venture, including Rye (he/him) and Gallica (she/her). Though they are reformist in some ways, their primary goal is greater autonomy for each Stel, freedom from the legal restraints, taxes, and oversights demanded by the Principality, with additional deregulation to follow downstream. The Devotees: A church from the Twilight Mirage that is committed to the worship of the Divine Devotion , which they sometimes refer to as Fervor. Common practices include the regular checking of one's pulse and multi-day group picnic outings. Divines The Divine Motion (she/her): One of the founding members of the Pact, the necromantic Apostolosian divine once led its infamous retinue, the Black Century, on Partizan. They were defeated and dispersed, turned into part of Kalmeria, during Operation Shackled Sun. Mysteries Axioms: Once, these beings were made by a so-called \"Post-Divine\" as embodiments of particular ideals, supposedly detached from mortal perspective or subjectivity. Now, they are the emanation of one woman's ideals, given perfect, violent form. In this way, The Ingrate is the first of its kind. Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has recently bonded with Kalmeria.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for hallucinations, death, and brief mention of mind control. Across Palisade, the gears of Kesh's occupation grind to halt, for however brief a time. Attaches clear the schedules of their client-commanders. Chefs discard the still-fresh ingredients for the coming week's feasts. Countless BIS operatives—many of whom hid in plain sight as attaches or chefs—simply vanish one midday, lost to long hallways and shaded corners. And in their stead, the Divine Crusade moves. This week on PALISADE: Resentment and Frustration Pt. 2 I bought a 'Rari just so I can go faster (skrrr) Dossier People Occam Olio (they/them): Columnar member of the Frontier Syndicate and low level officer of Lock & Cross Security Services. Sharp the way a knife is. Made themself a hero among Palisade Bilats during Frontier Syndicate operation against Rose River. Silverbrick (they/them): A \"visionary\" architect, technologist, and urban planner of the Frontier Syndicate. Blank Shore (he/him): Ex-Concretist Hacker, happy that \"the future is finally here.\" Claims to be \"perfectly apolitical.\" Jesset City (he/him): After helping to kick off Millennium Break on Partizan, Jesset served as one of its major leaders during its expansion across the Principality. Now, he uses his talents in Hollow and Altar engineering, piloting, and cipher breaking on behalf of the Grey Pond unit of the cause. Still considers himself to be a member of the Party of the Wolf, though those designations have largely fallen from use. Gentian (she/her): Elect of the Divine Crusade. Impossibly old, yet a source of power and vibrance. Attended to by her two sword bearers ( Ramondre (she/her) and Ignadiah (he/him), Knight of Books ( Clawed (he/him) ), and Knight of Cups ( Perevel (they/them) ). Elle Evensong (she/they): Elle arrived to Palisade along with the first wave of Devotees, making a name for herself as a cunning combatant and clever commander. She became a poster child for Twilight Mirage's support of Palisade (and, for members of the Dim Liturgy, a prophesied bridge between the past and the future). But as the war began to heat up, she seemed to vanish into the background. Pilot of the Cataphract. Factions Bilateral Intercession: One of two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, comprised by Stels Kesh and Nideo, and lead by the so-called Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh (he/him), who took control of the faction from the Curtain, a secretive intelligence organization with roots in Kesh's ancient spy operations. The \"Bilats\" are a conservative and reactionary force, aiming to return the Principality to its roots both literally and figuratively. After a long campaign against the Pact of Free States, they managed to take control of Palisade. The Frontier Syndicate : A powerful conglomerate with a broad purview, including technology, heavy industry, entertainment, telecommunications, and transportation. Led by Exenceaster March (he/him), former chair of the Columnar R&D giant the Zenith Fund, the Syndicate betrayed the Pact of Free States and joined the Bilats in order to be part of their colonization efforts on Palisade. The Pact of Free States: One of the two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, a joint operation by Stels Columnar and Apostolos. Jade Kill: Based in Joyous Guard, this military arm of the Cause is operated by the Delegate liberation faction known as Reunion and supported by Kalar Anakalar's (he/him) Giantkiller unit and a wing of Swordbreakers. Led by August Righteousness (he/him). Lock and Cross Security Services: The largest mercenary unit on Palisade, invited to the world by Exenceaster March. Founded by Maidstone Cross (she/her) and Margate Lock (she/her), a pair of divorcees too committed to their work together to fully separate. Margate was lost to the depths of the Diadem. The Branched: A post-human society of beings who have transformed their bodies into forms terrifying and spectacular and free—only to have the threat of war force them to rebuild themselves as soldiers first and foremost. After centuries of fighting a purely defensive war, the Branched have now begun to strike into the Principality's territory. Places Diadem Gravtrain: While the vast trench-city on Palisade's equator lays abandoned, Kesh has reactivated its railway via an operations center in Carmathen. Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Carhaix: The northernmost city in the Bontive Valley, Carhaix is one of the first major settlements founded by the nascent Divine Principality 5,000 years ago. It was created on the site of a battlefield where they obliterated the straggling remnants of the Advent Group, an organization that had invaded and pillaged the Twilight Mirage. After the Principality left Palisade behind, it became one of the Fabreal Duchy's many centers of power in the northwestern continent. Currently, it is controlled by Jade Kill. Objects The Stellar Combustor: A weapon of immense destruction, capable of destroying countless star systems if deployed without a firebreak. Has been used in some form or another since the time of the earliest Divines. In current form they take the form of a twirling, 3-ringed space station that rotates around a system's sun. Divines Discernment (it/its): Able to see the whole of the galaxy for one moment a year, this massive Divine was stolen by Millennium Break in the years after Operation Shackled Sun. The Divine Crusade (they/them): Leads Stel Nideo's occupation on Palisade along with their Elect, Gentian. Crusade is an enormous, bipedal machine covered (or perhaps made with) beautiful stained glass. Additional Notes Delegates: In plain terms, Delegates are synthetic individuals created through a process of forcible extraction from a living Divine. Originated by the Fabreal Duchy, who were left behind to \"attend to\" Palisade by the Divine Principality around 5000 years ago, these Delgates were designed and used as slaves. Currently, a Delegate resistance group called Reunion operates out of the fortress Joyous Guard in the Caldera Stretch.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for discussions of assassinations and death. The star at the center of the Palisade system seemed to release a breath, and all at once across the Bilateral Intercession, the line between \"outcome,\" \"consequence,\" and \"blowback\" became stunningly clear. Malicious action alone would have led to a great loss. But in negligent inaction, something worse has emerged: chaos. Now, something must be done. Blame must be assigned. Accountability must be achieved. Change must come to Palisade. This week on PALISADE: Resentment and Frustration Pt 1 Shadows of planes / Flying overhead Dossier People Stargrave Elcessor (she/her): Leader of the Bilateral Interecession's occupation of Palisade, assigned personally by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. As a Stargrave, she has been granted the means and \"right\" to detonate the star at the center of Palisade's star system if she determines that those here are an existential threat to the Principality. Connadine (he/him) : Commander of the Bilateral Intelligence Service on Palisade. An expert in psychological operations and folklore. As a composer, his opus is the Adagio, a plan to get everyone on Palisade operating in ways not only predictable, but scripted. As a conductor, his orchestra now turns towards the second movement.

The New Asterism: What was once a schism between Received and Progressive Asterism has now been healed by the false prophet Gur Sevraq (he/they), or at least someone in his name and face. The New Asterism claims that to be a citizen of the Principality is to have an obligation to \"better the world,\" in the sense that one invests in property or in the way that a settler \"rehabilitates\" or \"improves\" the places they claim by violence.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for body horror, mass death/genocide, mind control, and extreme heat. For months, even before the sun bulged red, the only way to think about events on Palisade was with large numbers. Troop maneuvers. Logistical networks. Centuries of oppression. A continent of power. But now all of that has collapsed. Now it is minutes, not hours. Meters, not miles. Guards, not battalions. A set of hallways. A set of doors. A set of people trying to breach them. And beyond them, a question: Tomorrow, will there be any events on Palisade at all? I step all around the pieces on the floor / Wires and cords, and records, and tapes Dossier People Stargrave Elcessor (she/her): Leader of the Bilateral Interecession's occupation of Palisade, assigned personally by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh.

Mustard Red (she/her): A cyborg who once served as a member of Brink Proxy, with a speciality in surveillance. Joined the Cause during the Devotees expansion onto Palisade. Midnite Matinee (she/her): Leporine scout and member of the Blue Channel. She and her trusty Pack-model light AutoHollow Popcorn used to run a repo company, but now are tentatively committed to the Cause and Millennium Break. Factions STEREOMA: Pact truebeliver Cor'rina Corrine (cor/cors, they/them) and cor rival Misericorde (he/they) have begun building a surgical, anti-Bilat hit squad on Paliade.

Objects Gambeson: The Gambeson is only about 10 meters tall (less than half an Altar), but it is nevertheless a terrifying scourge of the battlefield. Modeled after an iron maiden, except with it's tortorous doors attached to its back serving as wings. Its head features a metalworked face, twisted into extreme and offputting smile. Its skeletal frame serves not only as body, but cage: pilots are criminal conscripts forced to pay off their \"debt\" to Kesh by the Divine Plight, earning their freedom through combat achievements. Paramerion : Cori's new Altar, as designed by her brother Formido. Constantly twitching and rippling underneath the regal embellishments of its filigreed armor. Massive metallic wings stay folded on its back, a smaller pair cover its eyes like a visor and the sickles jut out from its forearms when stowed. A halo shaped like a crown rotates above its skull-like head. The Stellar Combustor: A weapon of immense destruction, capable of destroying countless star systems if deployed without a firebreak. Has been used in some form or another since the time of the earliest Divines. In current form they take the form of a twirling, 3-ringed space station that rotates around a system's sun. BAC Secateurs: Designed and built on Chimera's Lantern by the Blessed Armory of Consecration, an Altar who holds itself in the form of a tortured saint, with sharp, crystaline \"holy expressions\" emerging from its body, like wounds in reverse. As it pulls these from its body, its form glows like heated glass, then reverberates back into place. Divines The Divine, Arbitrage (it/its): The amoral machine turned de facto treasurer keeps the Frontier Syndicate a step ahead in all matters of commerce. Sole minter of \"glint,\" a newly popular currency on Palisade. The Divine Plight (she/her): Plight is a 40 meter tall, humanoid Divine cast in black metal armor, and wearing the of a judge or inquisitor. She conscripts the guilty into her army as Gambeson pilots, compelling their loyalty with terrible, Divine feelings of guilt. Hemlock, whose interest is fundamentally in punishment and not justice, was born heir to a mid-tier Kesh House, but jumped at the chance to become an Elect. The Divine Consecration: Though humanoid in shape, like most Nideo Divines, its chest is a vacuous cavity that serves a living forge. This open wound burns brightly, and Consecration can reach inside of it to produce a range of objects, or a sort of Divine molten metal which rapidly hardens as it is shaped by the Divine. But this is only half of its fearsome nature. Guided by the hand of its elect, a Sovereign Immunity devoutly committed to his role as armorer, Consecration also operates as Nideo's chief weaponsmith, Altar designer, and forge. The Divine Souciance: When the burgeoning Divine Principality left Palisade behind, the Divine Souciance carried doubts about the project. So bloody was the Embarkation, so strenuous the objection of those who opposed the Glass Duchy's rule, that Souciance—ever committed to careful consideration and compassionate concern—never found their place in the Empire, however grand the vision Nideo had presented before his death was. But, devoted to steady study, Souciance played their part for generations. It was not until the Divine Clash that they came to their decision: They could not be part of an empire so vast, so terrible, so cruel. And so they sought out a place where they could do what Divines no longer could. They sought out a grave. Mysteries The Iconoclasts: Something beyond the human, desperate to eradicate subjectivity itself. After their messenger, the Usher of Truth, was delivered to The Witch in Glass, they have found themselves serving a new master. Axioms: Once, these beings were made by a so-called \"Post-Divine\" as embodiments of particular ideals, supposedly detached from mortal perspective or subjectivity. Now, they are the emanation of one woman's ideals, given perfect, violent form. In this way, The Ingrate is the first of its kind. Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has recently bonded with Kalmeria. Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Sylvi Bullet ( @sylvibullet ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Text by Austin Walker Cover Art by by aurahack ( aurahack.jp ) With thanks to Arthur B., chocoube, DB, deepFlaw, Edwin Adelsberger, Emrys, Greg Cobb, huw, Ian O'Dea, Ian Urbina, Irina A., Jack Shirai, K.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for vomiting, mass death/genocide, mind control, manipulation, body horror, forced body modification, and extreme heat. They arrive in the long rings of the Stellar Combustor to no greeting, and this they are thankful for. The path to their objective is known, but what lies on it (and what they'll find at its end) are not. As they travel the length of the arc, spanning half the circumference of the sun, they wonder: How are their friends, now traveling through lunar shadow, far across the solar system? How are their comrades? Might they find freedom in the dark as we search for it in the searing light? Futures tricked by the past / Spectre, how he laughs Dossier People Stargrave Elcessor (she/her): Leader of the Bilateral Interecession's occupation of Palisade, assigned personally by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. As a Stargrave, she has been granted the means and \"right\" to detonate the star at the center of Palisade's star system if she determines that those here are an existential threat to the Principality. Connadine (he/him): Commander of the BIS on Palisade. An expert in psychological operations and folklore. As a composer, his opus is the Adagio, a plan to get everyone on Palisade operating in ways not only predictable, but scripted. As a conductor, his orchestra now turns towards the second movement. Routine Rennari (he/him): Half-Apostolsian, scion of a minor Kesh noble house, and the Blue Channel's heavy. Mustard Red (she/her): A cyborg who once served as a member of Brink Proxy, with a speciality in surveillance. Joined the Cause during the Devotees expansion onto Palisade. Midnite Matinee (she/her): Leporine scout and member of the Blue Channel. She and her trusty Pack-model light AutoHollow Popcorn used to run a repo company, but now are tentatively committed to the Cause and Millennium Break. Places Chimera's Lantern: The second moon of Palisade, shaped oddly like a wasp's nest or paper lantern. New arrivals to the world find its occasional glow unnatural and frightening. Thisbe and the Figure found evidence that it could be tied to driving the bulk of ancient Divine Principality forces off of Palisade. Home to the Chimeric Cadent (they/them, it/its), along with the warded corpses of a number of Divines, including Sagacity, Dissent, Felicity, Barricade, and Bounty—its newest resident. Objects Gambeson: The Gambeson is only about 10 meters tall (less than half an Altar), but it is nevertheless a terrifying scourge of the battlefield. Modeled after an iron maiden, except with it's tortorous doors attached to its back serving as wings. Its head features a metalworked face, twisted into extreme and offputting smile. Its skeletal frame serves not only as body, but cage: pilots are criminal conscripts forced to pay off their \"debt\" to Kesh by the Divine Plight, earning their freedom through combat achievements. Paramerion : Cori's new Altar, as designed by her brother Formido. Constantly twitching and rippling underneath the regal embellishments of its filigreed armor. Massive metallic wings stay folded on its back, a smaller pair cover its eyes like a visor and the sickles jut out from its forearms when stowed. A halo shaped like a crown rotates above its skull-like head. The Stellar Combustor: A weapon of immense destruction, capable of destroying countless star systems if deployed without a firebreak. Has been used in some form or another since the time of the earliest Divines. In current form they take the form of a twirling, 3-ringed space station that rotates around a system's sun. BAC Secateurs: Designed and built on Chimera's Lantern by the Blessed Armory of Consecration, an Altar who holds itself in the form of a tortured saint, with sharp, crystaline \"holy expressions\" emerging from its body, like wounds in reverse. As it pulls these from its body, its form glows like heated glass, then reverberates back into place. Divines The Divine, Arbitrage (it/its): The amoral machine turned de facto treasurer keeps the Frontier Syndicate a step ahead in all matters of commerce.

The ball is in the air; water pours from the pitcher; the rope draws taut. The Blue Channel hides in the shadow of the Chimera's Lantern, and everyone on board holds their breath. Inside the strange moon, the search for a new source of power—and thus, stability and freedom—for the Figure continues.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for discussion of mass destruction/death, discussion of medical treatment, mind reading and medical coercion, discussion of ethnic cleansing. Across Palisade, fingers rest on triggers, and some triggers are bigger than others. In clammy rooms, sweat slides down skin and throats are cleared without direction. Aimless eyes track the dust drifting in the red rays coming through the window. Outside the sun swells and bulges, driven sick with the possibility that it might eradicate possibility itself. A decision must be made. This week on PALISADE 21: In Their Fear Pt. 2 Why can't we dance in the same groove every day? Dossier Organizations Violet Cove: The Dim Liturgy claim to have seen the Divine Devotion's arrival coming in their sacred text: A battered and corrupted backup of Crystal Palace's final predictions for the future. Now the two cults work together to oust the Bilats... and perhaps to do more intriguing things, as well. The Devotees: A church from the Twilight Mirage that is committed to the worship of the divine Devotion, which they sometimes refer to as Fervor. Common practices include the regular checking of one's pulse and multi-day group picnic outings. STEREOMA: Pact truebeliver Cor'rina Corrine and cor rival Misericorde have begun building a surgical, anti-Bilat hit squad on Paliade. Jade Kill: Based in Joyous Guard, this military arm of the Cause is operated by the Delegate liberation faction known as Reunion and supported by Kalar Anakalar's (he/him) Giantkiller unit and a wing of Swordbreakers. Led by August Righteousness (he/him). People Griesel Sunset (he/him): Coriolos' father. A zealous Devotee. Recently deceased. Formido Sunset (he/him): Coriolos' brother, a member of the Devotee's research and development division. Phobos Sunset (he/him): Coriolos' second brother. Bing-32: A floating, cat sized drone able to use a variety of tools. Now mass produced for use across Millennium Break. Originally designed by Kalvin Brnine, though under another name. Stargrave Elcessor (she/her): Leader of the Bilateral Interecession's occupation of Palisade, assigned personally by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. As a Stargrave, she has been granted the means and \"right\" to detonate the star at the center of Palisade's star system if she determines that those here are an existential threat to the Principality. The Witch in Glass (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the broken body of the Divine Past, which she has renamed the Reflecting Pool. Rules over the Crown of Glass, a city-state on the southeastern reaches of Palisade. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. Haunted by an old foe. Connadine (he/him): Commander of the BIS on Palisade. An expert in psychological operations and folklore. As a composer, his opus is the Adagio , a plan to get everyone on Palisade operating in ways not only predictable, but scripted. As a conductor, his orchestra now turns towards the second movement. Saint Decario Dicario (he/him): Devoted Devotee warmonger and one-time lover of the Twilight Mirage rockstar Teleos Triton Tanager. Elle Evensong (she/they) - Elle arrived to Palisade along with the first wave of Devotees, making a name for herself as a cunning combatant and clever commander. She became a poster child for Twilight Mirage's support of Palisade (and, for members of the Dim Liturgy, a prophesied bridge between the past and the future). But as the war began to heat up, she seemed to vanish into the background. Pilot of the Cataphract. Saffron Septet (she/her): A doctor from the Twilight Mirage who lives as a digital consciousness, spread across a number of bodily forms including a heavy Torch Unit, a small motorcycle, and a unique and specially-crafted surgeon body. Misericorde 'Miseri' (he/they): Former Nidean scion who helped secure Palisade for the Bilateral Intercession. Officially MIA, but secretly working with Pact loyalist Cor'rina Corrine (cor/cors), famed Apostolosian peacemaker (and Miseri's rival), as agents of chaos on the planet. Places Diadem Gravtrain: While the vast trench-city on Palisade's equator lays abandoned, Kesh has reactivated its railway via an operations center in Carmathen. Tintagel: A city and fortress that marked the Fabreal Duchy's farthest reach on Palisade's southern continent. Stargrave Elcessor uses its palace as her operations center and home when she is on planet. Brecheliant Forest: A vast, mysterious forest on Palisade's southern continent said to confuse even the most experience of travelers. The Paint Shop: Sitting atop the central peak of Steeple Catterick, most people assume the Paint Shop to be no more than an artist commune where visiting artists collaborate on eccentric and avant-garde work. In truth, it is both a manufactory and front for the Bilateral Intelligence Service. Divines Asepsis (it/its): The final living remnants of a Divine who pursues its particular vision of purity at the cost of everything else. Kept, studied, and utilized by Captain Kalvin Brnine. Recently confounded by BIS spy Zedd Z. Izzard. The Divine, Arbitrage (it/its): The amoral machine turned de facto treasurer keeps the Frontier Syndicate a step ahead in all matters of commerce. Sole minter of \"glint,\" a newly popular currency on Palisade. Mysteries The Iconoclasts: Something beyond the human, desperate to eradicate subjectivity itself. Chimera's Lantern: The second moon of Palisade, shaped oddly like a wasp's nest or paper lantern. New arrivals to the world find its occasional glow unnatural and frightening.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for civilian harm and death. The Bilateral Intercession's net continues to spread across Palisade in response to (and retribution for) the events on the Isle of the Broken Key. In the east, the Frontier Syndicate draws ever nearer to extracting the remaining Fundament Nodes inside Palisade's surface, a task opposed by a Divine who's pledged undying fealty to the people of this planet and its neighboring worlds. Meanwhile, in an undisclosed location, Crusade's Elect, Gentian, has called a most monumental meeting of the minds. Their goal? To discover who, exactly, opposes them on Palisade. But hers is not the only snare closing… This week on PALISADE: PALISADE 18: How It Always Looks Pt. 2 Won't you come and join the party / Dress to kill, dress to kill Dossier Organizations Jade Kill: Based in Joyous Guard, this military arm of the Cause is operated by the Delegate liberation faction known as Reunion and supported by Kalar Anakalar's (he/him) Giantkiller unit and a wing of Swordbreakers. Led by August Righteousness (he/him). Violet Cove: The Dim Liturgy claim to have seen the Divine Devotion's arrival coming in their sacred text: A battered and corrupted backup of Crystal Palace's final predictions for the future. Now the two cults work together to oust the Bilats... and perhaps to do more intriguing things, as well. Grey Pond: With members of the Oxblood Clan, the Company of the Spade, and the Shale Belt's Concrete Front, these blue collar revolutionaries are experts at getting the Cause the equipment it needs (and maintaining what it has when that's the only available option). Carmine Bight: From ramshackle additions to the rocky shores of Rifle Island, Captain Skelton Knaggs (he/him) and his fearsome flotilla launch rusted pirate vessels beneath the waves, guided by a coalition of Hyphan navigators. Rose River: Though they are undoubtedly committed to the Cause, this unique research unit (combining Veronique (she/her), her Divine Fealty (any pronouns), and their followers with an out-of-time NEH Sleep Detachment squad) hope for a day when they can be something other than soldiers. Lock and Cross Security Services: The largest mercenary unit on Palisade, invited to the world by Exenceaster March. Founded by Maidstone Cross (she/her) and Margate Lock (she/her), a pair of divorcees too committed to their work together to fully separate. Margate was lost to the depths of the Diadem. The Lone Marble Group: Built around a single artifact recovered from an ancient Advent facility, this Frontier Syndicate subsidiary develops the future of Bilat war machinery. People Connadine (he/him): Commander of the BIS on Palisade. An expert in psychological operations and folklore. As a composer, his opus is the Adagio, a plan to get everyone on Palisade operating in ways not only predictable, but scripted. As a conductor, his orchestra now turns towards the second movement. Fool Factotum (she/her): Dedicated member of the BIS, assigned to Connadine's new executive unit. Difficult to guess her age. Gentian (she/her): Elect of the Divine Crusade. Impossibly old, yet a source of power and vibrance. Ramondre (she/her) and Ignadiah (he/him): Swordbearers of Gentian, Elect of Crusade. Rivalrous and devout. Stargrave Elcessor (she/her): Leader of the Bilateral Interecession's occupation of Palisade, assigned personally by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. As a Stargrave, she has been granted the means and \"right\" to detonate the star at the center of Palisade's star system if she determines that those here are an existential threat to the Principality. Exenchester March (he/him): Founder of the Frontier Syndicate and the March Institute, former chair of the Zenith Fund. Betrayed the Pact and Stel Columnar, defecting to the Bilateral Intercession in exchange for territory on Palisade and the freedom to use it as he wishes. Occam Olio (they/them): Columnar member of the Frontier Syndicate and low level officer of Lock & Cross Security Services. Sharp the way a knife is. The Witch in Glass (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the broken body of the Divine Past, which she has renamed the Reflecting Pool. Rules over the Crown of Glass, a city-state on the southeastern reaches of Palisade. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. Haunted by an old foe. Objects LMG Altar: Colloquially, the most prominent mechs of the current era of the Principality are all called \"Altars,\" but this is a name derived from one specific design: The Lone Marble Group Altar, a mech designed by Exanceaster March's top weapons team, capable of harnessing any of the new sources of power. Though it's offerings are straight forward, even simple, It has become the go-to frame for combatants across the galaxy. LMG Bench: A long, four-legged Hollow that services as a mobile support unit. Can be fitted for communications, repair, medical, and industrial needs. LMG Throne: A specialized re-model of the Altar with greater focus on detachable \"bits,\" free-floating drones that can augment the pilot's attacking vectors. Places Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Diadem Gravtrain: While the vast trench-city on Palisade's equator lays abandoned, Kesh has reactivated its railway via an operations center in Carmathen. The Paint Shop: Sitting atop the central peak of Steeple Catterick, most people assume the Paint Shop to be no more than an artist commune where visiting artists collaborate on eccentric and avant-garde work. In truth, it is both a manufactory and front for the Bilateral Intelligence Service. Divines Asepsis (it/its): The final living remnants of a Divine who pursues its particular vision of purity at the cost of everything else. Kept, studied, and utilized by Captain Kalvin Brnine. Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has recently bonded with Kalmeria. The Divine Crusade (they/them): Leads Stel Nideo's occupation on Palisade along with their Elect, Gentian. Crusade is an enormous, bipedal machine covered (or perhaps made with) beautiful stained glass. Mysteries The Iconoclasts: Something beyond the human, desperate to eradicate subjectivity itself. The Fundament: In the depths of the world, further on even than the Diadem… there is the Fundament.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for distorted and layered vocals, discussion of civilian death and mass destruction, description of being bound, tight spaces, compulsive thoughts and mind control After the calamitous encounter at the Isle of the Broken Key, the Bilateral Intercession finds itself on the back foot. Key intelligence assets compromised. A flagship, along with its crew and commander, lost to the sea. Insurgents capturing resources from the Diadem's train lines. A snare closing around on Stargrave Elcessor. Something must be done. Something must be done. This week on PALISADE: How It Always Looks Pt. 1 [instrumental] Dossier Organizations Bilateral Intercession: One of two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, comprised by Stels Kesh and Nideo, and lead by the so-called Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh (he/him), who took control of the faction from the Curtain, a secretive intelligence organization with roots in Kesh's ancient spy operations. The \"Bilats\" are a conservative and reactionary force, aiming to return the Principality to its roots both literally and figuratively. After a long campaign against the Pact of Free States, they managed to take control of Palisade. Jade Kill: Based in Joyous Guard, this military arm of the Cause is operated by the Delegate liberation faction known as Reunion and supported by Kalar Anakalar's (he/him) Giantkiller unit and a wing of Swordbreakers. Led by August Righteousness (he/him). Violet Cove: The Dim Liturgy claim to have seen the Divine Devotion's arrival coming in their sacred text: A battered and corrupted backup of Crystal Palace's final predictions for the future.

The New Asterism: What was once a schism between Received and Progressive Asterism has now been healed by the false prophet Gur Sevraq (he/they), or at least someone in his name and face. The New Asterism claims that to be a citizen of the Principality is to have an obligation to \"better the world,\" in the sense that one invests in property or in the way that a settler \"rehabilitates\" or \"improves\" the places they claim by violence. People Stargrave Elcessor (she/her): Leader of the Bilateral Interecession's occupation of Palisade, assigned personally by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. As a Stargrave, she has been granted the means and \"right\" to detonate the star at the center of Palisade's star system if she determines that those here are an existential threat to the Principality. Connadine (he/him): Commander of the BIS on Palisade. An expert in psychological operations and folklore. As a composer, his opus is the Adagio , a plan to get everyone on Palisade operating in ways not only predictable, but scripted. As a conductor, his orchestra now turns towards the second movement. Elle Evensong (she/they) - Elle arrived to Palisade along with the first wave of Devotees, making a name for herself as a cunning combatant and clever commander. She became a poster child for Twilight Mirage's support of Palisade (and, for members of the Dim Liturgy, a prophesied bridge between the past and the future). But as the war began to heat up, she seemed to vanish into the background. Pilot of the Cataphract. Zedd Z. Izzard (he/him): Lovable dirtbag chef. Works in main hall's mess hall. Knows everyone's favorite drink and most people's favorite meal. Satisfactory pilot. BIS Spy. Routine Rennari (he/him): Half-Apostolsian, scion of a minor Kesh noble house, and the Blue Channel's heavy. Saffron Septet (she/her): A doctor from the Twilight Mirage who lives as a digital consciousness, spread across a number of bodily forms including a heavy Torch Unit, a small motorcycle, and a unique and specially-crafted surgeon body. Partial Palisade (he/him): A man who was once a Divine, now living in the shell of a being quite unlike what he once was. Mustard Red (she/her): A cyborg who once served as a member of Brink Proxy, with a speciality in surveillance. Joined the Cause during the Devotees expansion onto Palisade. Stargrave Elcessor (she/her): Leader of the Bilateral Interecession's occupation of Palisade, assigned personally by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. As a Stargrave, she has been granted the means and \"right\" to detonate the star at the center of Palisade's star system if she determines that those here are an existential threat to the Principality. Places Chimera's Lantern: The second moon of Palisade, shaped oddly like a wasp's nest or paper lantern. New arrivals to the world find its occasional glow unnatural and frightening. Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Diadem Gravtrain: While the vast trench-city on Palisade's equator lays abandoned, Kesh has reactivated its railway via an operations center in Carmathen. The Paint Shop: Sitting atop the central peak of Steeple Catterick, most people assume the Paint Shop to be no more than an artist commune where visiting artists collaborate on eccentric and avant-garde work. In truth, it is both a manufactory and front for the Bilateral Intelligence Service . Divines Asepsis (it/its): The final living remnants of a Divine who pursues its particular vision of purity at the cost of everything else. Kept, studied, and utilized by Captain Kalvin Brnine. Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has recently bonded with Kalmeria. Mysteries The Iconoclasts: Something beyond the human, desperate to eradicate subjectivity itself. The Five Afflictions : A group of \"monstrous\" beings that haunt the dark corners of Palisade.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for blood, civilian harm and death, parental death, conscription, torture and kidnapping. Under the wings of the Kestrel White, war washes ashore the Isle of the Broken Key. Soon after the crew of the Blue Channel released Kenneth Marian Colver, Bilateral Viceroy to Palisade and convert of the Usher of Truth, he ordered his flagship to return and lay waste to the home of the Dim Liturgy and Devotees. Now, the Cause fights not only for ideals but for survival. A rifle takes aim. A hammer lifts into the air. A cannonade echoes for miles. The monastery burns. and the blaze casts a shadow too long for a single night's contemplation. This week on PALISADE: Upon Our Grace Pt. 4 I'm out / There's nothing here to care about / What's that sound? / What's that song about? / It's nothin' worth me sayin' aloud Dossier Organizations Violet Cove: The Dim Liturgy claim to have seen the Divine Devotion's arrival coming in their sacred text: A battered and corrupted backup of Crystal Palace's final predictions for the future. Now the two cults work together to oust the Bilats... and perhaps to do more intriguing things, as well. The Devotees: A church from the Twilight Mirage that is committed to the worship of the divine Devotion, which they sometimes refer to as Fervor. Common practices include the regular checking of one's pulse and multi-day group picnic outings. People Connadine (he/him): Commander of the BIS on Palisade. An expert in psychological operations and folklore. As a composer, his opus is the Adagio , a plan to get everyone on Palisade operating in ways not only predictable, but scripted. As a conductor, his orchestra now turns towards the second movement. Saint Decario Dicario (he/him): Devoted Devotee warmonger and one-time lover of the Twilight Mirage rockstar Teleos Triton Tanager. Sea Crepuscule (he/him): Master of the Concave Wing of the Dim Liturgy's primary monastery, where he leads the search for specific details and predictions from the Glass Archive's remnants. Additionally, the most highly placed member of the Paint Shop (and thus, most important shield for the BIS spies) inside of Dim Liturgy. Marlon Styx a.k.a. Em (he/him): Undercover BIS agent assigned to infiltrate Violet Cove. Has become enamored with the Dim Liturgy's holy text. Tea Time (she/her): Assistant to the assistant of Dicario St. Dicario. BIS Spy. Queue 1224 (he/him): A non-Columnar synthetic monk who helps with preparing parts of the Thing Itself for movement to Convex or Concave. BIS Spy. Zedd Z. Izzard (he/him): Lovable dirtbag chef. Works in main hall's mess hall. Knows everyone's favorite drink and most people's favorite meal. Satisfactory pilot. BIS Spy. Bea Earlyday (she/her): Young Chariot pilot assigned to the defense of the Isle of the Broken Key. Under Griesel Sunset's command. BIS Spy. Kay (they/them): Cashier of the monastery treasury. BIS Spy. Tenn Alpenglow (he/him): Bodyguard of Kenneth Marian Colver and Knight of the Fabreal Duchy. Resents his assignation to guard the cowardly Viceroy, but takes seriously his sworn oath to serve under the Duchy's new masters. Kenneth Marian Colver (he/him): Former member of the Curtain, now Kesh's Viceroy on the world. Reports up to the Stargrave. Bread concerns have been replaced with violence concerns. Kensley Marlowe Colver (she/her): Sister of Kenneth Marian Colver, pilot of a Gorget, award winning hunter of megafauna, and craven champion of cruelty. Elle Evensong (she/they) - Elle arrived to Palisade along with the first wave of Devotees, making a name for herself as a cunning combatant and clever commander. She became a poster child for Twilight Mirage's support of Palisade (and, for members of the Dim Liturgy, a prophesied bridge between the past and the future). But as the war began to heat up, she seemed to vanish into the background. Pilot of the Cataphract. Midnite Matinee (she/her) : Leporine scout and member of the Blue Channel. She and her trusty Pack-model light AutoHollow Popcorn (she/her) used to run a repo company, but now are tentatively committed to the Cause and Millennium Break. Routine Rennari (he/him): Half-Apostolsian, scion of a minor Kesh noble house, and the Blue Channel's heavy. Hunting \"Hunt\" Tomorrow (he/him): Concretist specialist in communications and technology, assigned to the Blue Channel during its integration into the Cause. Saffron Septet (she/her): A doctor from the Twilight Mirage who lives as a digital consciousness, spread across a number of bodily forms including a heavy Torch Unit, a small motorcycle, and a unique and specially-crafted surgeon body. Places Isle of the Broken Key: Home of the Dim Liturgy since its obscure creation thousands of years ago. Now serves as base for the entire Violet Cove unit of the Cause, including the Devotees and (most recently) additional support teams from the Twilight Mirage. Chimera's Lantern: The second moon of Palisade, shaped oddly like a wasp's nest or paper lantern. New arrivals to the world find its occasional glow unnatural and frightening. Objects The Kestral White : Flagship of Palisade's Viceroy, Kenneth Marrian Colver. Hovers like a hawk on a thermal updraft, searching for its prey. Gambeson: The Gambeson is only about 10 meters tall (less than half an Altar), but it is nevertheless a terrifying scourge of the battlefield. Modeled after an iron maiden, except with it's tortorous doors attached to its back serving as wings. Its head features a metalworked face, twisted into extreme and offputting smile. Its skeletal frame serves not only as body, but cage: pilots are criminal conscripts forced to pay off their \"debt\" to Kesh by the Divine Plight , earning their freedom through combat achievements. Gorget: When visible, the Gorget is a bright and fashionable machine, its long features clad in golden armor, yet hidden playfully covered by a chic red hunting cape. When walking, it's posture is buoyed by a fashionable walking cane. But at a whim, the Altar's pilot may extend the length of the cape, surrounding the entire body with a layer of magical camouflage, cloaking it from both sensors and plain sight. And at that moment, its cane twists and folds, revealing itself to be a perfectly honed rifle. Cataphract: When the engineers loyal to Devotion studied the data from the Chariot Mk. 1 units, they saw they had a problem: maximum results required a lethal amount of blood from the pilots. One solution to this problem would become the Charoit Mk. 2, which offered more efficient energy exchange per ounce of ichor taken. The Cataphract, which draws on the blood of others to perform unimaginable feats, is the other. Divines Asepsis (it/its): The final living remnants of a Divine who pursues its particular vision of purity at the cost of everything else. Kept, studied, and utilized by Captain Kalvin Brnine. The Reflecting Pool, f.k.a the Divine Past, f.k.a. Crystal Palace (it/its): In the era before the founding of the Divine Principality, Crystal Palace served as the supreme oracle engine of the Rapid Evening and the Principality of Kesh. At the end of that era, it lost its ability to predict the future, but continued as a vast archive of the past, and became canonized as the Divine Past (which now serves as the Reflecting Pool, center of the Witch in Glass' kingdom). The final record of its predictions into the future are stored on Palisade, under protection (and study) of the Dim Liturgy and Violet Cove.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for civilian harm and death, torture, conscription, and kidnapping. With the list of Bilateral Intelligence Service spies secure and the immediate threat from Fabreal Knight Tenn Alpenglow resolved, the crew of the Blue Channel discusses what to do next. Should they prioritize capturing the BIS agents they've identified, and if so, how would they go about that? Should they turn the list over to the Cause's leadership, deferring the decision to others and winning some points in the process? For each potential option, there seems to be a flaw.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for discussion of death. With the Cause stretched thin, it is up to the Blue Channel to rearm, resupply, and restore their allies. It should be a simple operation, but each delivery of supplies comes with its own new revelations. Some—like the arrival of new supplies from their freebooting friends of Carmine Bight—are welcome surprises. Others, like new details about the Afflictions, are stunning developments. And one hangs over the others: a revelation of the most mundane sort, like the heading of a memo, or the typeface of a meeting's minutes… This week on PALISADE: Worth the Trouble Pt. 2 A dried up cityscape / My twisted personality / My forgotten past / My distorted memories Dossier Organizations Jade Kill: Based in Joyous Guard, this military arm of the Cause is operated by the Delegate liberation faction known as Reunion and supported by Kalar Anakalar's (he/him) Giantkiller unit and a wing of Swordbreakers. Led by August Righteousness (he/him). Violet Cove: The Dim Liturgy claim to have seen the Divine Devotion's arrival coming in their sacred text: A battered and corrupted backup of Crystal Palace's final predictions for the future. Now the two cults work together to oust the Bilats... and perhaps to do more intriguing things, as well. Grey Pond: With members of the Oxblood Clan, the Company of the Spade, and the Shale Belt's Concrete Front, these blue collar revolutionaries are experts at getting the Cause the equipment it needs (and maintaining what it has when that's the only available option). Carmine Bight: From ramshackle additions to the rocky shores of Rifle Island, Captain Skelton Knaggs (he/him) and his fearsome flotilla launch rusted pirate vessels beneath the waves, guided by a coalition of Hyphan navigators. Rose River: Though they are undoubtedly committed to the Cause, this unique research unit (combining Veronique (she/her), her Divine Fealty (any pronouns), and their followers with an out-of-time NEH Sleep Detachment squad) hope for a day when they can be something other than soldiers. The Branched: A post-human society of beings who have transformed their bodies into forms terrifying and spectacular and free—only to have the threat of war force them to rebuild themselves as soldiers first and foremost. After centuries of fighting a purely defensive war, the Branched have now begun to strike into the Principality's territory. The Sable Court: These Hyphan witches once lived only on the eastern shores of Partizan's Lake Timea, horns and antlers glittering in the light of Girandole. But today, they soar through the sea of stars, following the same Strand paths that their ancestors once did. New Earth Hegemony: Once, the NEH was massive, galactic-scale power that threatened conquest of The Twilight Mirage. It was reduced to a single fleet—now lost—which provided its inhabitants endless, digital life. People Jesset City (he/him): After helping to kick off Millennium Break on Partizan, Jesset served as one of its major leaders during its expansion across the Principality. Now, he uses his talents in Hollow and Altar engineering, piloting, and cipher breaking on behalf of the Grey Pond unit of the cause. Still considers himself to be a member of the Party of the Wolf, though those designations have largely fallen from use. General Tomorrow Mourning (she/her): Leader of the Qui'Err Coalition's forces en route to the Twilight Mirage. Silverbrick (they/them): A \"visionary\" architect, technologist, and urban planner of the Frontier Syndicate. Kalar Anakalar, the Giantkiller (he/him): This legendary member of Millennium Break is much more than his nom de guerre. Loyal comrade, proud father, and ever faithful believer. Former member of the Society for Banners and Bright Returns, one of the founding organizations of Millennium Break. Partial Palisade (he/him): A man who was once a Divine, now living in the shell of a being quite unlike what he once was. Griesel Sunset (he/him): Coriolos' father, a zealous Devotee. Currently lives on the Isle of the Broken Key. Iklins Slinger (she/her): Carmine Bight's sword arm. Naval tactics. Fire and fury. Fiercely loyal to Captain Skelton Knaggs. Mustard Red (she/her): A cyborg who once served as a member of Brink Proxy, with a speciality in surveillance. Joined the Cause during the Devotees expansion onto Palisade. Places Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. The Shale Belt: A low, resource-filled mountain range in the north-central of Palisade. Home to the Concretists and their revolutionary Concrete Front, a secular and technologically-minded group with roots in the Twilight Mirage. They take their names from favorite artistic works and have blended their bodies with a special concrete (and some respiratory cybernetics) that aids in their breathing. The Brink: A space station and transport hub that orbits the outer edge of the Twilight Mirage. Divines The \"Divine\" Arbit: The amoral machine turned de facto treasurer keeps the Frontier Syndicate a step ahead in all matters of commerce. Mysteries The Five Afflictions : A group of \"monstrous\" beings that haunt the dark corners of Palisade. They have been named as follows: Dust a.k.a Pride's Mirror a.k.a. The Looking Glass Refrain a.k.a. Yesterday's Reprise a.k.a. The Ghastly Chorus Ravel a.k.a. Labyrinth's Thread a.k.a. The Hedge Maze Cleave a.k.a. Whetstone's Opposite a.k.a.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for mind reading and medical coercion. Though the Cause has made important gains during their most recent efforts, they nevertheless find themselves limping. In the northwest, both Jade Kill and Grey Pond find themselves stretched thin, low on key resources necessary for holding their newly taken territory in the Bontive Valley. Rose River and Carmine Bight, normally sustained by keeping to their island strongholds, have instead been deployed across the planet, and find themselves low on basic goods. Even the Dim Liturgy seems under-supplied—the contents of their supply depots do not match up with their balance books. How could that have happened? And so it seems at this moment that resupplying the Cause falls on the Blue Channel. Unfortunately, the Blue Channel has many of its own wounds to lick first… This week on PALISADE: Worth the Trouble Pt. 1 I'm not okay / In fact, I'm sick today, I'm on the floor Dossier Organizations The Branched: A post-human society of beings who have transformed their bodies into forms terrifying and spectacular and free—only to have the threat of war force them to rebuild themselves as soldiers first and foremost. After centuries of fighting a purely defensive war, the Branched have now begun to strike into the Principality's territory. The Devotees: A church from the Twilight Mirage that is committed to the worship of the divine Devotion, which they sometimes refer to as Fervor. Common practices include the regular checking of one's pulse and multi-day group picnic outings. People The Witch in Glass a.k.a. Clementine Kesh (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the broken body of the Divine Past, which she has renamed the Reflecting Pool. Rules over the Crown of Glass, a city-state on the southeastern reaches of Palisade. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. Haunted by an old foe. Gucci Garantine (she/her): A defector from Stel Kesh, who used the remaining wealth and power of House Brightline to help found Millennium Break. Currently a key member of the resistance efforts on Palisade, and the commander of Millennium Break forces there. Codename Watershed. Midnite Matinee (she/her) : Leporine scout and member of the Blue Channel. She and her trusty Pack-model light AutoHollow Popcorn (she/her) used to run a repo company, but now are tentatively committed to the Cause and Millennium Break. Routine Rennari (he/him): Half-Apostolsian, scion of a minor Kesh noble house, and the Blue Channel's heavy. Hunting \"Hunt\" Tomorrow (he/him): Concretist specialist in communications and technology, assigned to the Blue Channel during its integration into the Cause. Saffron Septet (she/her): A doctor from the Twilight Mirage who lives as a digital consciousness, spread across a number of bodily forms including a heavy Torch Unit, a small motorcycle, and a unique and specially-crafted surgeon body. Gig Kephart (he/him): A DIY vlogger from the Twilight Mirage who lived during a time of chaos and change, just years before the founding of the Divine Principality. Misericorde 'Miseri' (he/they): Former Nidean scion who helped secure Palisade for the Bilateral Intercession. Officially MIA, but secretly working with Pact loyalist Cor'rina Corrine (cor/cors), famed Apostolosian peacemaker (and Miseri's rival), as agents of chaos on the planet. Places The Twilight Mirage: Created over 5000 years ago by what was then the Divine Empyrean in an effort to protect the Divine Fleet, of which they were a member. The Mirage is a false nebula that obscures the position of its inhabitants both visually and by distorting time and space. Inside, there is now a vibrant and peaceful culture that spans eight planets, orbiting a dark and living Divine sun. Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Divines Perennial (she/her): The Principality's so-called 'adversary,' who lives at the center of the galaxy and whose chaotic whims spread through her \"Perennial Wave,\" an ever-present nanoparticle that has recently bonded with Kalmeria.

      "description": "Across Palisade, the Bilateral Intecession continue to respond to the Cause's expansion into the Bontive Valley. For some, like the Swordbearer Ramondre, this means a direct response in defense of one's honor. But for others, like BIS Commander Connadine, it means an opportunity to pursue more intriguing targets than mere revolutionaries. This week on PALISADE: The Wheels Turning Pt. 2 Homeward we go, it's victory Dossier Organizations The Bilateral Intelligence Service: Formerly called the Curtain, the BIS is a Kesh-operated organization which specializes in espionage, subterfuge, and surveillance. Though it is as secretive as ever, it is no longer the true source of power in Kesh territory. Instead, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh has modernized its structure and operation, and has ensured that it remains well integrated into the Bilateral Intercession's greater workings—as to better keep one eye on them.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for death and gun violence. While the Cause was executing its daring (and risky) capture of the northern Bontive Valley, Palisade continued to spin. In the south east, a witch considers what she might do with ideal power. In the center of the world, a false prophet delivers empty sermons. And in the depths of the Shale Belt, agents of the Frontier syndicate seek out something long hidden… This week on PALISADE: Reflect the world that falls apart Dossier Organizations Bilateral Intercession: One of two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, comprised by Stels Kesh and Nideo, and lead by the so-called Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh (he/him), who took control of the faction from the Curtain, a secretive intelligence organization with roots in Kesh's ancient spy operations. The \"Bilats\" are a conservative and reactionary force, aiming to return the Principality to its roots both literally and figuratively. After a long campaign against the Pact of Free States, they managed to take control of Palisade. The Bilateral Intelligence Service: Formerly called the Curtain, the BIS is a Kesh-operated organization which specializes in espionage, subterfuge, and surveillance. Though it is as secretive as ever, it is no longer the true source of power in Kesh territory. Instead, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh has modernized its structure and operation, and has ensured that it remains well integrated into the Bilateral Intercession's greater workings—as to better keep one eye on them. The Frontier Syndicate: A powerful conglomerate with a broad purview, including technology, heavy industry, entertainment, telecommunications, and transportation. Led by Exenceaster March (he/him), the Syndicate betrayed the Pact of Free States and joined the Bilats in order to be part of their colonization efforts on Palisade. Fabreal Duchy: When the Divine Principality left Palisade nearly 5,000 years ago, they left behind a Duke and his barons as caretakers. In the generations that followed, they ruled as petty tyrants, creating Delegates as their slaves, remaking their bodies into glass and oil, and extending their reach across Palisade's continents. The New Asterism: What was once a schism between Received and Progressive Asterism has now been healed by the false prophet Gur Sevraq (he/they), or at least someone in his name and face. The New Asterism claims that to be a citizen of the Principality is to have an obligation to \"better the world,\" in the sense that one invests in property or in the way that a settler \"rehabilitates\" or \"improves\" the places they claim by violence. Blue Channel: Both the name of Kalvin Brnine's corvette-class carrier and the Cause-aligned faction made up by its crew. Upgraded with Kalmeria-era technology to enhance its basic functionality, along with other quality-of-life features. Jade Kill: Based in Joyous Guard, this military arm of the Cause is operated by the Delegate liberation faction known as Reunion and supported by Kalar Anakalar's Giantkiller unit and a wing of Swordbreakers. Led by August Righteousness (he/him). Violet Cove: The Dim Liturgy claim to have seen the Divine Devotion's arrival coming in their sacred text: A battered and corrupted backup of Crystal Palace's final predictions for the future. Now the two cults work together to oust the Bilats... and perhaps to do more intriguing things, as well. Grey Pond: With members of the Oxblood Clan, the Company of the Spade, and the Shale Belt's Concrete Front, these blue collar revolutionaries are experts at getting the Cause the equipment it needs (and maintaining what it has when that's the only available option). Carmine Bight: From ramshackle additions to the rocky shores of Rifle Island, Captain Skelton Knaggs (he/him) and his fearsome flotilla launch rusted pirate vessels beneath the waves, guided by a coalition of Hyphan navigators. Rose River: Though they are undoubtedly committed to the Cause, this unique research unit (combining Veronique (she/her), her Divine Fealty (any pronouns), and their followers with an out-of-time NEH Sleep Detachment squad) hope for a day when they can be something other than soldiers. Lock and Cross Security Services: The largest mercenary unit on Palisade, invited to the world by Exenceaster March. Founded by Maidstone Cross (she/her) and Margate Lock (she/her), a pair of divorcees too committed to their work together to fully separate. Margate was lost to the depths of the Diadem. People Stargrave Elcessor (she/her): Leader of the Bilateral Interecession's occupation of Palisade, assigned personally by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. As a Stargrave, she has been granted the means and \"right\" to detonate the star at the center of Palisade's star system if she determines that those here are an existential threat to the Principality. Connadine (he/him): Commander of the BIS on Palisade. An expert in psychological operations and folklore. A conductor warming his orchestra. Silverbrick (they/them): A \"visionary\" architect, technologist, and urban planner of the Frontier Syndicate. Blank Shore (he/him): Ex-Concretist Hacker, happy that \"the future is finally here.\" Claims to be \"perfectly apolitical.\" Marlon Styx (he/him): Undercover BIS agent assigned to infiltrate Violet Cove. Has become enamored with the Dim Liturgy's holy text. Exenchester March (he/him): Founder of the Frontier Syndicate and the March Institute, former chair of the Zenith Fund. Betrayed the Pact and Stel Columnar, defecting to the Bilateral Intercession in exchange for territory on Palisade and the freedom to use it as he wishes. The Witch in Glass (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the broken body of the Divine Past, which she has renamed the Reflecting Pool. Rules over the Crown of Glass, a city-state on the southeastern reaches of Palisade. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. Haunted by an old foe. The Lost Duchess, Constantina Malady (she/her): It was said, she would arrive on a black horse with white fetlocks. She did. But they did not say what would come after. Places Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Temple of the Threshold: Built at the center of a massive bridge that crosses the Diadem, this serves as the home of New Asterism and its false prophet, Gur Sevraq (he/they). The Shale Belt: A low, resource-filled mountain range in the north-central of Palisade. Home to the Concretists and their revolutionary Concrete Front, a secular and technologically-minded group with roots in the Twilight Mirage. They take their names from favorite artistic works and have blended their bodies with a special concrete (and some respiratory cybernetics) that aids in their breathing.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for blood, uncanny body horror, and unconsciousness. The Blue Channel's mission was delivered in simple terms: Prevent their target, codenamed Gem, from reaching her destination in the Fabreal Duchy's capital city. But as the mission has progressed, and as the group's commander receives increasingly troubling messages from Gucci Garantine, it's increasingly clear that the crew is being is missing information. What is the purpose of this attack? Who is their target, really? And from what concrete prison has she seemingly escaped from? This week on PALISADE: The Canvas of Dreams Pt. 4 [solari] Dossier Organizations Fabreal Duchy: When the Divine Principality left Palisade nearly 5,000 years ago, they left behind a Duke and his barons as caretakers. In the generations that followed, they ruled as petty tyrants, creating Delegates as their slaves, remaking their bodies into glass and oil, and extending their reach across Palisade's continents. Violet Cove: The Dim Liturgy claim to have seen the Divine Devotion's arrival coming in their sacred text: A battered and corrupted backup of Crystal Palace's final predictions for the future. Now the two cults work together to oust the Bilats... and perhaps to do more intriguing things, as well. People \"Gem\" (she/her): Codename given to the target of Operation Midnight Lapidary. Reported to be a major dealer in precious metals and stones from Stel Orion, here to attend the coronation of the returned Duchess Constantina Malady. Clearly more than she lets on... Kenneth Marian Colver (he/him): Former member of the Curtain, now Kesh's Viceroy on the world. Reports up to the Stargrave. Bread concerns have been replaced with violence concerns. Tenn Alpenglow (he/him): Bodyguard of Kenneth Marian Colver and Knight of the Fabreal Duchy. Resents his assignation to guard the cowardly Viceroy, but takes seriously his sworn oath to serve under the Duchy's new masters. The Lost Duchess, Constantina Malady (she/her): Just as it is said, she arrived on a black horse with white fetlocks. Ramondre (she/her) and Ignadiah (he/him): Swordbearers of Gentian, Elect of Crusade. Rivalrous and devout. Kalar Anakalar, the Giantkiller (he/him): This legendary member of Millennium Break is much more than his nom de guerre. Loyal comrade, proud father, and ever faithful believer. Former member of the Society for Banners and Bright Returns, one of the founding organizations of Millennium Break. Quintessence \"Tessence\" Rey (he/him): Joined Millennium Break when the group aided an Equiaxed commune in Vigil City, Partizan. Pilots a customized (but out of date) Kosmos unit for Jade Kill. Protege of Kalar Anakalar. The Witch in Glass (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the broken body of the Divine Past, which she has renamed the Reflecting Pool. Rules over the Crown of Glass, a city-state on the southeastern reaches of Palisade. A shaky ally of Millennium Break and cruelly indifferent master of the Figure in Bismuth. Haunted by an old foe. August Righteousness (he/they): Once, August served as the court chef of Joyous Guard. Now, he is the commander of Reunion, a Delegate resistance movement that is part of the Cause's Jade Kill unit. Gucci Garantine (she/her): A defector from Stel Kesh, who used the remaining wealth and power of House Brightline to help found Millennium Break. Currently a key member of the resistance efforts on Palisade, partially responsible for the operation of Millennium Break forces there. Codename Watershed. General Tomorrow Mourning (she/her): Leader of the Qui'Err Coalition's forces en route to the Twilight Mirage. Marlon Styx a.k.a. \"Em\" (he/him): Undercover BIS agent assigned to infiltrate Violet Cove. Has become enamored with the Dim Liturgy's holy text. Jesset City (he/him): After helping to kick off Millennium Break on Partizan, Jesset served as one of its major leaders during its expansion across the Principality. Now, he uses his talents in Hollow and Altar engineering, piloting, and cipher breaking on behalf of the Grey Pond unit of the cause. Still considers himself to be a member of the Party of the Wolf, though those designations have largely fallen from use. Places Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Isle of the Broken Key: Home of the Dim Liturgy since its obscure creation thousands of years ago. Now serves as base for the entire Violet Cove unit of the Cause, including the Devotees and (most recently) additional support teams from the Twilight Mirage. Chimera's Lantern: The second moon of Palisade, shaped oddly like a wasp's nest or paper lantern. New arrivals to the world find its occasional glow unnatural and frightening. Things BAC Billhook: Constantly in motion, the Billhook (designed by the Blessed Armory of the Divine Consecration) might be confused for a conceptual sculpture to the uninitiated. It is a humanoid design with five arms, two on the left and three on the right, though the right-central one always crosses its body to cover its \"heart,\" behind which the cockpit rests. Most of the Billhook is all made with a special material that can change at an atomic level, switching between an elusive, clothlike silk and dangerously sharp stained glass form. As such, the Billhook can be a loose flag on the wind or a terrifying whirlwind of violence. EF Vambrace: Created by House Evenfall Altarworks, the Vambrace is the unlikely workhorse of the Kesh Altar fleet. With four arms worth of melee weapons and a mounted missile launcher, the Vambrace is able to reach the enemy under self-provided cover fire, defend themselves in melee until an opportunity presents itself, and then deliver the final blow. AdArm Bouquet: Designed by Stel Orion's Adamant Arms and Artifice as an Altar-era update to the classic Troop design. It's still boxy (if a little trimmer) and it retains it's wide, rectangular \"eye\" on its head. Gone are the heavy grip claws, replaced with traditional, five-fingered hands, allowing it more complex manipulations, including the operations of its distinctive Roundless Rifle, which seems convert raw Perennial Wave into ammunition. Additionally, the shoulder mount has ditched the heavy cannon in exchange for a close range, pneumatic lance that can devastate even the strongest armor. Roundless rifle looks like an H&K G11, and fires condensed Perennial Wave gathered from the atmosphere itself. AdArm Motion Engine: Core to all of Adamant Arms and Artifice's new designs, the Motion Engine was derived from salvaged parts of the lost Divine of the same name, offering a reliable, long lasting, and flexible source of power.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for the discussion of civilian deaths and the discussion of kidnapping. In typical fashion, the mission has a name as ostentatious as its object is mundane. \"Operation Midnight Lapidary\" is meant to be, in its most bloodless version, a sort of intimidating hit-and-run—though out-and-out wetwork would also be acceptable. The target, rumored to be a dealer in diamonds, rubies, and other precious gems, is en route to the Duchess' coronation, and must be stopped. Why? To what end? These are the sorts of questions left for those in leadership. For the members of the Blue Channel, there's only the mission. Well, the mission, and an invitation to an important meet-and-greet. This week on PALISADE: The Canvas of Dreams Pt. 1 Lights off / Nightlights Dossier Organizations Bilateral Intercession : One of two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, comprised by Stels Kesh and Nideo, and lead by the so-called Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh (he/him), who took control of the faction from the Curtain, a secretive intelligence organization with roots in Kesh's ancient spy operations. The \"Bilats\" are a conservative and reactionary force, aiming to return the Principality to its roots both literally and figuratively. After a long campaign against the Pact of Free States, they managed to take control of Palisade. Violet Cove: The Dim Liturgy claim to have seen the Divine Devotion's arrival coming in their sacred text: A battered and corrupted backup of Crystal Palace's final predictions for the future. Now the two cults work together to oust the Bilats... and perhaps to do more intriguing things, as well. The Branched: A post-human society of beings who have transformed their bodies into forms terrifying and spectacular and free—only to have the threat of war force them to rebuild themselves as soldiers first and foremost. After centuries of fighting a purely defensive war, the Branched have now begun to strike into the Principality's territory. People \"Gem\" (she/her): Codename given to the target of Operation Midnight Lapidary. Reported to be a major dealer in precious metals and stones from Stel Orion, here to attend the coronation of the returned Duchess Constantina Malady. The Witch in Glass a.k.a. Clementine Kesh (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the broken body of the Divine Past, which she has renamed the Reflecting Pool. Rules over the Crown of Glass, a city-state on the southeastern reaches of Palisade. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. Haunted by an old foe. Griesel Sunset (he/him): Coriolos' father, a zealous Devotee. Currently lives on the Isle of the Broken Key. General Tomorrow Mourning (she/her): Leader of the Qui'Err Coalition's forces en route to the Twilight Mirage. Marlon Styx (he/him): Undercover BIS agent assigned to infiltrate Violet Cove. Has become enamored with the Dim Liturgy's holy text. The Lost Duchess, Constantina Malady (she/her): Just as it is said, she arrived on a black horse with white fetlocks. Places Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Carhaix: The northernmost city in the Bontive Valley, Carhaix is one of the first major settlements founded by the nascent Divine Principality 5,000 years ago. It was created on the site of a battlefield where they obliterated the straggling remnants of the Advent Group, an organization that had invaded and pillaged the Twilight Mirage. After the Principality left Palisade behind, it became one of the Fabreal Duchy's many centers of power in the northwestern continent. Currently, it is controlled by Stel Nideo and the Divine Crusade. Carleon-Upon-Wisk: The capital of the Fabreal Duchy, situated on a peninsula on the Wisk Sea. Though it served as a major city before the Divine Principality left Palisade behind, it rose in stature when early barons of the Duchy \"discovered\" how to create delegates from chained Divines in the city's fell laboratories. Isle of the Broken Key: Home of the Dim Liturgy since its obscure creation thousands of years ago. Now serves as base for the entire Violet Cove unit of the Cause, including the Devotees and (most recently) additional support teams from the Twilight Mirage.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for coercion, mind reading, discussion of blood, and uncanny bodily manipulation. With one mission behind them and a new one approaching quickly, the crew of the Blue Channel finds time to relax in the most unlikely of places. But, as the colorful clouds gathering above remind us, no clear day lasts forever. This week on PALISADE: I Would Like To Help You Pt. 2 ...by this river... Dossier Organizations The Twill: Though many groups have lived on the world of Palisade over the years, the Twill can trace their time on the world back the furthest. Though a first glance appraisal might make one think that their defining trait is the moss that covers much of their bodies and allows them to live on sunlight and water alone, in fact their most unshakable cultural trait is a practice of collaboration, aid, and acceptance. When groups like Advent, Kesh, the New Earth Hegemony, and the Divine Principality left Palisade behind, they often left behind the disaffected or unwanted. It was often, if not always, the Twill who helped these people find sustainable lives on the world, either by blending with the group over generations or through open exchange of goods and information. The Devotees: A church from the Twilight Mirage that is committed to the worship of the divine Devotion, which they sometimes refer to as Fervor. Common practices include the regular checking of one's pulse and multi-day group picnic outings. Qui'Err Coalition: The govening body of the Twilight Mirage, comprised by affiliated communes, townships, and other groups across the system's eight worlds. New Earth Hegemony: Once, the NEH was massive, galactic-scale power that threatened conquest of The Twilight Mirage. It was reduced to a single fleet—now lost—which provided its inhabitants endless, digital life. People The Witch in Glass a.k.a. Clementine Kesh (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the broken body of the Divine Past, which she has renamed the Reflecting Pool. Rules over the Crown of Glass, a city-state on the southeastern reaches of Palisade. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. Haunted by an old foe. Griesel Sunset (he/him): Coriolos' father, a zealous Devotee. Currently lives on the Isle of the Broken Key. Kriminel Kollage (she/her): A young Twill tinkerer who tried to convince her community to help her ressurect the long dead divine, Palisade, and went through with it when they denied tos upport her. General Tomorrow Mourning (she/her): Leader of the Qui'Err Coalition's forces en route to the Twilight Mirage. Saffron Septet (she/her): A doctor from the Twilight Mirage who lives as a digital consciousness, spread across a number of bodily forms including a heavy Torch Unit, a small motorcycle, and a unique and specially-crafted surgeon body. Partial Palisade (he/him): A man who was once a Divine, now living in the shell of a being quite unlike what he once was. The Lost Duchess, Constantina Malady (she/her): Just as it is said, she arrived on a black horse with white fetlocks. Places The Twilight Mirage: Created over 5000 years ago by what was then the Divine Empyrean in an effort to protect the Divine Fleet, of which they were a member. The Mirage is a false nebula that obscures the position of its inhabitants both visually and by distorting time and space. Inside, there is now a vibrant and peaceful culture that spans eight planets, orbiting a dark and living Divine sun.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for the discussion of blood and uncanny bodily manipulation. Having placed the confusion of the Fundament Node behind them, the crew of the Blue Channel begin a slow tour across the few friendly ports in Palisade, refueling, resupplying, and escorting the displaced Twill into new, albeit temporary homes.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for death. The sun rises on Palisade and the work week begins. Delegates move quick and quiet through the back halls of Kesh palaces while their lords plot and scheme. Nidean settlers pray to their Divines and then take up their shovels to do the work of civil expansion. The most determined Frontier Syndicate technologists woke up hours ago, beating the sun's rise just like Exenceaster March says to do in his popular entrepreneurial handbook. And in a castle on the southern continent, the occupation's leader thumbs the trigger of her horrible device, as if the sun itself could see the gesture and would leash itself appropriately. This week on PALISADE: Today Is a Monday I trust I can rely on your vote. Dossier Organizations Bilateral Intercession: One of two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, comprised by Stels Kesh and Nideo, and lead by the so-called Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh (he/him), who took control of the faction from the Curtain, a secretive intelligence organization with roots in Kesh's ancient spy operations. The \"Bilats\" are a conservative and reactionary force, aiming to return the Principality to its roots both literally and figuratively. After a long campaign against the Pact of Free States, they managed to take control of Palisade. Stel Kesh: The oldest established power in the galaxy, built around a stuffy (and secretive) aristocracy. They are tied to the Past. History, knowledge, stubbornness. Stel Nideo: Created the largest faith in the empire, and used that influence to shape (and surveil) mass culture. They are tied to the Present. Faith, coercion, stability. The Bilateral Intelligence Service: Formerly called the Curtain, the BIS is a Kesh-operated organization which specializes in espionage, subterfuge, and surveillance. Though it is as secretive as ever, it is no longer the true source of power in Kesh territory. Instead, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh has modernized its structure and operation, and has ensured that it remains well integrated into the Bilateral Intercession's greater workings—as to better keep one eye on them. The Frontier Syndicate : A powerful conglomerate with a broad purview, including technology, heavy industry, entertainment, telecommunications, and transportation. Led by Exenceaster March (he/him), the Syndicate betrayed the Pact of Free States and joined the Bilats in order to be part of their colonization efforts on Palisade. Fabreal Duchy : When the Divine Principality left Palisade nearly 5,000 years ago, they left behind a Duke and his barons as caretakers. In the generations that followed, they ruled as petty tyrants, creating Delegates as their slaves, remaking their bodies into glass and oil, and extending their reach across Palisade's continents. The New Asterism: What was once a schism between Received and Progressive Asterism has now been healed by the false prophet Gur Sevraq (he/they), or at least someone in his name and face. The New Asterism claims that to be a citizen of the Principality is to have an obligation to \"better the world,\" in the sense that one invests in property or in the way that a settler \"rehabilitates\" or \"improves\" the places they claim by violence. The Lone Marble Group: Built around a single artifact recovered from an Advent facility, this Frontier Syndicate subsidiary develops the future of Bilat war machinery. The Advent Group: A group of colonial entrepreneurs, invaders, and professional exploiters. Eradicated 5000 years ago, during an attempt to occupy the Twilight Mirage. Blue Channel: Both the name of Kalvin Brnine's corvette-class carrier and the Cause-aligned faction made up by its crew. Upgraded with Kalmeria-era technology to enhance its basic functionality, along with other quality-of-life features. Jade Kill: Based in Joyous Guard, this military arm of the Cause is operated by the Delegate liberation faction known as Reunion and supported by Kalar Anakalar's Giantkiller unit and a wing of Swordbreakers. Led by August Righteousness (he/him). Violet Cove: The Dim Liturgy claim to have seen the Divine Devotion's arrival coming in their sacred text: A battered and corrupted backup of Crystal Palace's final predictions for the future. Now the two cults work together to oust the Bilats... and perhaps to do more intriguing things, as well. Grey Pond: With members of the Oxblood Clan, the Company of the Spade, and the Shale Belt's Concrete Front, these blue collar revolutionaries are experts at getting the Cause the equipment it needs (and maintaining what it has when that's the only available option). Carmine Bight: From ramshackle additions to the rocky shores of Rifle Island, Captain Skelton Knaggs (he/him) and his fearsome flotilla launch rusted pirate vessels beneath the waves, guided by a coalition of Hyphan navigators. Rose River: Though they are undoubtedly committed to the Cause, this unique research unit (combining Veronique (she/her), her Divine Fealty (any pronouns), and their followers with an out-of-time NEH Sleep Detachment squad) hope for a day when they can be something other than soldiers. Lock and Cross Security Services: The largest mercenary unit on Palisade, invited to the world by Exenceaster March. Operated by Maidstone Cross (she/her) and Margate Lock (she/her), a pair of divorcees too committed to their work together to fully separate People Stargrave Elcessor (she/her): Leader of the Bilateral Interecession's occupation of Palisade, assigned personally by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. As a Stargrave, she has been granted the means and \"right\" to detonate the star at the center of Palisade's star system if she determines that those here are an existential threat to the Principality. Connadine (he/him): Commander of the BIS on Palisade. An expert in psychological operations and folklore. A conductor warming his orchestra. Fool Factotum (she/her): Dedicated member of the BIS, assigned to Connadine's new executive unit. Difficult to guess her age. Marlon Styx (he/him): Undercover BIS agent assigned to infiltrate Violet Cove. Has become enamored with the Dim Liturgy's holy text. Aram Nideo (he/him): Often called the \"The Father of Asterism,\" Aram Nideo penned the \"Many Stars Argument,\" which became the backbone not only for the Divine Principality's faith but also its governmental structure. Posthumously awarded Divine status. Was part of the nascent Divine Principality's occupation on the world. Grand Magnificent (he/him): A complex in the history of the Twilight Mirage. Member of the Notion, Excerpt of the Divine Arbit, and (above all else) an artist. Exenchester March (he/him): Founder of the Frontier Syndicate and the March Institute, former chair of the Zenith Fund. Betrayed the Pact and Stel Columnar, defecting to the Bilateral Intercession in exchange for territory on Palisade and the freedom to use it as he wishes. The Witch in Glass (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the broken body of the Divine Past, which she has renamed the Reflecting Pool. Rules over the Crown of Glass, a city-state on the southeastern reaches of Palisade. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. Haunted by an old foe. Gentian (she/her): Elect of the Divine Crusade. Impossibly old, yet a source of power and vibrance. Attended to by her two sword bearers (Ramondre (she/her) and Ignadiah (he/him), Knight of Books (Clawed (he/him)), and Knight of Cups (Perevel (they/them)). Kenneth Marian Colver (he/him): Former member of the Curtain, now Kesh's Viceroy on the world. Reports up to the Stargrave. Has bread concerns. The Lost Duchess, Constantina Malady (she/her): Just as it is said, she arrived on a black horse with white fetlocks. Gucci Garantine (she/her): A defector from Stel Kesh, who used the remaining wealth and power of House Brightline to help found Millennium Break. Currently a key member of the resistance efforts on Palisade, and the commander of Millennium Break forces there. Codename Watershed. Candles Penumbra (she/her): Member of Rose River. Reading in a library in the Diadem when she receives a call from Gucci Garantine. Places The Diadem: A wide and deep scar dug into Palisade's equator by the early Divine Principality. It promised to be a vast arcology that people could live and work in. Instead, it simply ruined the world. Diadem Gravtrain: While the vast trench-city on Palisade's equator lays abandoned, Kesh has reactivated its railway via an operations center in Carmathen. Tintagel: A city and fortress that marked the Fabreal Duchy's farthest reach on Palisade's southern continent. Stargrave Elcessor uses its palace as her operations center and home when she is on planet. Brecheliant Forest: A vast, mysterious forest on Palisade's southern continent said to confuse even the most experience of travelers. The Paint Shop: Sitting atop the central peak of Steeple Catterick, most people assume the Paint Shop to be no more than an artist commune where visiting artists collaborate on eccentric and avant-garde work. In truth, it is both a manufactory and front for the Bilateral Intelligence Service. Bontive Valley: Blessed by the departed divine Bounty, the Valley provides the Bilats with fruit that never rots and hyper-nutritional grain. Temple of the Treshold: Built at the center of a massive bridge that crosses the Diadem, this serves as the home of New Asterism and its false prophet, Gur Sevraq (he/they). The Shale Belt: A low, resource-filled mountain range in the north-central of Palisade. Home to the Concretists and their revolutionary Concrete Front, a secular and technologically-minded group with roots in the Twilight Mirage. They take their names from favorite artistic works and have blended their bodies with a special concrete (and some respiratory cybernetics) that aids in their breathing. Greenfield: A central territory on Palisade taken over by the Frontier Syndicate. Previously, the fields and streams of this area were home to the Twill. Composure's Coliseum: Operated by a revivified Divine who instrumentalizes the data of both the death-sport combatants and bloodthirsty fans. Divines The Divine Crusade (they/them): Leads Stel Nideo's occupation on Palisade along with their Elect, Gentian . Crusade is an enormous, bipedal machine covered (or perhaps made with) beautiful stained glass. The Divine Resonance (it/its): The watchful guardian, doting caregiver, and ardent supporter of Nideo's colonial efforts on Palisade. The Divine, Arbitrage (it/its): The amoral machine turned de facto treasurer keeps the Frontier Syndicate a step ahead in all matters of commerce. Sole minter of \"glint,\" a newly popular currency on Palisade. Mysteries The Fundament: In the depths of the world, further on even than the Diadem… there is the Fundament. The Five Afflictions: A group of \"monstrous\" beings that haunt the dark corners of Palisade. They have been named as follows: Dust a.k.a Pride's Mirror a.k.a. The Looking Glass Refrain a.k.a. Yesterday's Reprise a.k.a. The Ghastly Chorus Ravel a.k.a. Labyrinth's Thread a.k.a. The Hedge Maze Cleave a.k.a. Whetstone's Opposite a.k.a. The Sanguine Hatchet Oversight a.k.a. Hell's Facade a.k.a. The Empty Garden Things BAC Plough: Forged by the Blessed Armory of the Divine Consecration, the humanoid Plough has a statuesque build that it uses to wield heavy weapons, like a bulldozer-sized claw-scoop or a Heavy Arbalest designed to launch roped harpoons. The Plough's primary purpose is to be Nideo's frontline unit, but it is as valuable after a fight as it is in one. It is used in the destruction and replacement of \"old\" or \"neglected\" locations with new Nideo bases and settlements, and as such serves a propagandistic function by demonstrating that \"soldier\" and \"settler\" are two sides of the same coin.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for body horror, descriptions of violence and injury, gun violence, death, and blood. It is said that in the lowest depths of Diadem, deep below the surface of Palisade itself, there exists a network so ancient and so important that the people who named it were right to call it the Fundament. Most who know its name believe that it controls the Diadem itself, and could be key to bringing the long dead city back online. Others suspect that it connects to the train and power lines that run across the planet's continents. And the most superstitious—those who know the Afflictions by name (and claim to know the proper prayers to say to keep them at bay)—believe the Fundament's power goes beyond even that: to the seas, to the skies, to weather, and life itself. It is at the door to this mythical place that the crew of the Blue Channel find themselves now, entwined in battle with Bilateral interlopers and desperate to finish the job they were sent to do. This week on PALISADE: Into the World Pt. 2 And I feel so dangerous when you say I'm doin' fine now Dossier Organizations The Divine Principality: The largest empire in the Milky Way Galaxy, spanning multiple arms and billions of stars. Comprised of five somewhat-autonomous sub-states, the Stels. Currently, the Principality is engaged in wars both external and internal, the prior with their neighbors, the Branched, and the latter a civil war between the competing factions and pretenders to the Princept's throne. The Branched: A post-human society of beings who have transformed their bodies into forms terrifying and spectacular and free—only to have the threat of war force them to rebuild themselves as soldiers first and foremost. After centuries of fighting a purely defensive war, the Branched have now begun to strike into the Principality's territory. Bilateral Intercession: One of two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, comprised by Stels Kesh and Nideo, and lead by the so-called Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh (he/him), who took control of the faction from the Curtain, a secretive intelligence organization with roots in Kesh's ancient spy operations. The \"Bilats\" are a conservative and reactionary force, aiming to return the Principality to its roots both literally and figuratively. After a long campaign against the Pact of Free States, they managed to take control of Palisade. Stel Kesh: The oldest established power in the galaxy, built around a stuffy (and secretive) aristocracy. They are tied to the Past. History, knowledge, stubbornness. Stel Nideo: Created the largest faith in the empire, and used that influence to shape (and surveil) mass culture. They are tied to the Present. Faith, coercion, stability. The Pact of Free States: One of the two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, a joint operation by Stels Columnar and Apostolos. Led in name by the Glorious Princept, Dahlia (they/them), but operated in day-to-day matters by members of the original Pact of Necessary Venture, including Rye (he/him) and Gallica (she/her). Though they are reformist in some ways, their primary goal is greater autonomy for each Stel, freedom from the legal restraints, taxes, and oversights demanded by the Principality, with additional deregulation to follow downstream. Stel Columnar: A reformist democracy, made up largely of synthetics on the cutting edge of technology, art, politics, and war. They are tied to the Future. Innovation, style, cowardice. Stel Apostolos: A dynamic and diverse military powerhouse, whose dedication to self-expression is eclipsed only by their dedication to violence. They are tied to Motion. Speed, change, violence. The Frontier Syndicate: A powerful conglomerate with a broad purview, including technology, heavy industry, entertainment, telecommunications, and transportation. Led by Exenceaster March (he/him), the Syndicate betrayed the Pact of Free States and joined the Bilats in order to be part of their colonization efforts on Palisade. Stel Orion: An industrial giant that controls more literal space than any other Stel, yet is also the most fragmented, now facing regular internal strife between various corporate powers. Orion is currently the only Stel not involved directly in the galactic civil war, and thus free to operate across every star system. They are tied to Space. Wealth, labor, expansion. Millennium Break: Dissidents, idealogues, rebels, and mercenaries who launched a revolution from Partizan, moon of Girandole. Today, they agree on much, and most of all, this: It is time for a new Millennium. The New Asterism: What was once a schism between Received and Progressive Asterism has now been healed by the false prophet Gur Sevraq (he/they), or at least someone in his name and face. The New Asterism claims that to be a citizen of the Principality is to have an obligation to \"better the world,\" in the sense that one invests in property or in the way that a settler \"rehabilitates\" or \"improves\" the places they claim by violence. The Twill: Though many groups have lived on the world of Palisade over the years, the Twill can trace their time on the world back the furthest. Though a first glance appraisal might make one think that their defining trait is the moss that covers much of their bodies and allows them to live on sunlight and water alone, in fact their most unshakable cultural trait is a practice of collaboration, aid, and acceptance. When groups like Advent, Kesh, the New Earth Hegemony, and the Divine Principality left Palisade behind, they often left behind the disaffected or unwanted. It was often, if not always, the Twill who helped these people find sustainable lives on the world, either by blending with the group over generations or through open exchange of goods and information. The Devotees: A church from the Twilight Mirage that is committed to the worship of the divine Devotion, which they sometimes refer to as Fervor. Common practices include the regular checking of one's pulse and multi-day group picnic outings. People Kalvin Brnine (they/them): Captain of the Blue Channel, former weapons technician and de facto leader of the Society of Banners and Bright Returns. Apostolosian born, Orion trained, committed to Millennium Break. Thisbe (she/her): A large, humanoid labor robot whose design is based on the ancient Hypha people. Unearthed by farmers and traded between mercenary units, she eventually wound up working for the Society of Banners and Bright Returns and moved on to work with Millennium Break. The Figure in Bismuth (he/they): Once, the Figure was an ordinary, conservative history teacher who was fatally wounded in a conflict on Partizan. After being resurrected by the Witch in Glass, they have become a supernaturally gifted ace pilot. On loan to Millennium Break. Phrygian (they/them): A Branched researcher who arrived on Partizan to investigate something called the True Divine. After being captured by the Pact, they were eventually freed by Millennium Break, which they joined up with. Coriolis Sunset (she/her): Devotee of Devotion and native of the Twilight Mirage, Cori seeks to defend the weak and spread the word of her blessed Divine. Gucci Garantine (she/her): A defector from Stel Kesh, who used the remaining wealth and power of House Brightline to help found Millennium Break. Currently a key member of the resistance efforts on Palisade, and the commander of Millennium Break forces there. Kriminel Kollage (she/her): A young Twill tinkerer, working on a project that few believed would ever work. Places The Diadem: A wide and deep scar dug into Palisade's equator by the early Divine Principality. It promised to be a vast arcology that people could live and work in. Instead, it simply ruined the world. The Shale Belt: A low, resource-filled mountain range in the north-central of Palisade. Home to the Concretists and their revolutionary Concrete Front, a secular and technologically-minded group with roots in the Twilight Mirage. They take their names from favorite artistic works and have blended their bodies with a special concrete (and some respiratory cybernetics) that aids in their breathing. Greenfield: A central territory on Palisade taken over by the Frontier Syndicate. Previously, the fields and streams of this area were home to the Twill. Divines Asepsis (it/its): The final living remnants of a Divine who pursues its particular vision of purity at the cost of everything else. Kept, studied, and utilized by Captain Kalvin Brnine. Mysteries The Fundament: In the depths of the world, further on even than the Diadem… there is the Fundament. The Afflictions: A group of \"monstrous\" beings that haunt the dark corners of Palisade. The Divine Fleet: A precursor civilization to what would (in part) grow to become the Divine Principality. For thirty thousand years, it strived towards Utopian ideals and perhaps, for some time, even achieved them. Things BAC Plough: Forged by the Blessed Armory of the Divine Consecration , the humanoid Plough has a statuesque build that it uses to wield heavy weapons, like a bulldozer-sized claw-scoop or a Heavy Arbalest designed to launch roped harpoons. The Plough's primary purpose is to be Nideo's frontline unit, but it is as valuable after a fight as it is in one. It is used in the destruction and replacement of \"old\" or \"neglected\" locations with new Nideo bases and settlements, and as such serves a propagandistic function by demonstrating that \"soldier\" and \"settler\" are two sides of the same coin. EF Hauberk : Created by House Evenfall Altarworks , the Haubark is capable of deadly, unpredictable, and striking acts of violence. It is beyond \"lanky,\" with upper and torso extended, with extra joints and top-flight tensors for added flexibility. Its lower half, though, is an extremely thick tire, allowing it for rapid ingress and egress. It is both covered in and wields restraining chains infused with the nullifying magic used by Kesh, and is able to pin its foes down before finishing them off. Tier III. Approach: Mundane. LMG Gueridon: Designed by the Lone Marble Group for use by Exanceaster March's personal security operations, the Gueridon is a modern siege tower. It walks on four, elegant table-like legs, is protected by an Arcane energy dome above, and is operated from within a vast, circular a carriage compartment, with enchanted portholes that enhance the hand-held weapons of anyone firing from inside out. Also carries an infantry deployment pod. Tier II. Approach: Arcane Chariot Mk. 2: Coriolis' Altar, commonly used among the Devotees. A humanoid mech with an angular frame, pointed shoulders and three rotating halos. The head is covered in eyes, and its body has purple lights running along it in the shape of a circulatory system. A cape hangs over the right arm of the mech and can be cast off when it begins combat. Approach: Divine The Devil's Two Front Teeth: The Figure in Bismuth's Altar. A tall, angular machine whose posture is hunched down as if it is always ready to pounce. It was originally built without heatsinnks or vents, so the first time the Figure piloted this mech heat and energy exploded out of the frame and left the frame covered in pockmarks and jagged cavities. The most noticeable of these is a chunk missing from its \"chin\", giving it the appearance of a humanoid body missing its lower jaw with only two long, crooked teeth left in its mouth. As it flashes in and out of the battlefield, the heat and energy that escapes through these gashes sounds like a wailing wind. Tier III. Approach: Profane Mow (he/him): A recovered Zenith-A Project Eudaimonia prototype model, further upgraded with Altar-class technology. The build of a gorilla, quadrupedal & topheavy, a saddle horn-like addition on the back, battered but lovingly maintained. Newly painted. Tier III. Approach: Mundane The Blue Channel: The Blue Channel: Kalvin Brnine's corvette-class carrier. Upgraded with Kalmeria-era technology to enhance its basic functionality, along with other quality-of-life features. Tier V. Approach: Mundane. Additional Notes Delegates: In plain terms, Delegates are synthetic individuals created through a process of forcible extraction from a living Divine. Originated by the Fabreal Duchy, who were left behind to \"attend to\" Palisade by the Divine Principality around 5000 years ago, these Delgates were designed and used as slaves. Currently, a Delegate resistance group called Reunion operates out of the fortress Joyous Guard in the Caldera Stretch.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for ecological disaster, bodily transformation, and death. 5,000 years ago, the Divine Principality sprouted, and immediately began to grow in size and power. Founded on the world of Palisade, at the edge of the Twilight Mirage, the Principality spread across the stars and leaving its roots behind and forgetting their \"homeworld\" as it was lapped by the colorful clouds of the false nebula. New Divines were born. Old Divines were resurrected. Rivals were conquered or courted. Soon, the only enemy remaining were the Branched, a post-human society from the Golden Branch, whose influence and control spread to the oldest homes of some Principality states. Ten years ago, Dahlia, the Glorious Princept (born to Kesh, then kidnapped by Nideo, then rescued and raised into adulthood by Apostolos), declared themself leader of both Stel Kesh and Apostolos alongside a stunning revelation of the Principality's crimes against Apostolos. Kesh called these claims an Apostolosian ploy for power, and elected a minor noble, Cynosure Whitstar-Kesh as their champion, the Peaceful Princept. Five years ago, on the world of Partizan, open skirmishing between Apostolos and Kesh developed into a galaxy-wide civil war. On one side, the Curtain of Divinity, an ancient intelligence organization aligned with Stels Kesh and Nideo. On the other, Stels Columnar and Apostolos were put under the control of the Pact of Necessary Venture. Stel Orion itself fell into countless smaller internally and internecine conflicts. And between them all, Millennium Break formed—one hope for real change and resistance. Three years ago, outgunned and outclassed by their rivals, the Curtain rebranded as the Bilateral Intercession and began to search for a way to turn the tide in their war. At just the right time, they found it: Palisade. Their ancient staging ground, and perhaps, a way back into the Twilight Mirage, a system that moves out of time, and which holds power beyond compare… Now, the Bilats have taken Palisade and have begun searching for their way to exploit both the planet and its proximity to the Mirage. But resistance groups across Palisade have been joined by Millennium Break and others committed to stopping the Principality in all its forms. And they begin to act today, This week on PALISADE: Into the World Pt. 1 Pick a point on the globe, yes, the picture's the same Dossier Organizations The Divine Principality: The largest empire in the Milky Way Galaxy, spanning multiple arms and billions of stars. Comprised of five somewhat-autonomous sub-states, the Stels. Currently, the Principality is engaged in wars both external and internal, the prior with their neighbors, the Branched, and the latter a civil war between the competing factions and pretenders to the Princept's throne. The Branched: A post-human society of beings who have transformed their bodies into forms terrifying and spectacular and free—only to have the threat of war force them to rebuild themselves as soldiers first and foremost. After centuries of fighting a purely defensive war, the Branched have now begun to strike into the Principality's territory. Bilateral Intercession: One of two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, comprised by Stels Kesh and Nideo, and lead by the so-called Peaceful Princept, Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh (he/him), who took control of the faction from the Curtain, a secretive intelligence organization with roots in Kesh's ancient spy operations. The \"Bilats\" are a conservative and reactionary force, aiming to return the Principality to its roots both literally and figuratively. After a long campaign against the Pact of Free States, they managed to take control of Palisade. Stel Kesh: The oldest established power in the galaxy, built around a stuffy (and secretive) aristocracy. They are tied to the Past. History, knowledge, stubbornness. Stel Nideo: Created the largest faith in the empire, and used that influence to shape (and surveil) mass culture. They are tied to the Present. Faith, coercion, stability. The Pact of Free States: One of the two factions vying for leadership of the Principality, a joint operation by Stels Columnar and Apostolos. Led in name by the Glorious Princept, Dahlia (they/them), but operated in day-to-day matters by members of the original Pact of Necessary Venture, including Rye (he/him) and Gallica (she/her). Though they are reformist in some ways, their primary goal is greater autonomy for each Stel, freedom from the legal restraints, taxes, and oversights demanded by the Principality, with additional deregulation to follow downstream. Stel Columnar: A reformist democracy, made up largely of synthetics on the cutting edge of technology, art, politics, and war. They are tied to the Future. Innovation, style, cowardice. Stel Apostolos: A dynamic and diverse military powerhouse, whose dedication to self-expression is eclipsed only by their dedication to violence. They are tied to Motion. Speed, change, violence. The Frontier Syndicate: A powerful conglomerate with a broad purview, including technology, heavy industry, entertainment, telecommunications, and transportation. Led by Exenceaster March (he/him), the Syndicate betrayed the Pact of Free States and joined the Bilats in order to be part of their colonization efforts on Palisade. Stel Orion: An industrial giant that controls more literal space than any other Stel, yet is also the most fragmented, now facing regular internal strife between various corporate powers. Orion is currently the only Stel not involved directly in the galactic civil war, and thus free to operate across every star system. They are tied to Space. Wealth, labor, expansion.

Currently a key member of the resistance efforts on Palisade, and the commander of Millennium Break forces there. Baldwin Home a.k.a Black Screen (he/him): A member of the Shale Belt's anti-Principality revolutionary group, the Concrete Front, which operates from the caves of Sinder Karst. Baldwin operates a pirate broadcast station under the psuedonym \"BlackScreen,\" fitting since when his broadcasts take over an affected device, they not only blank out the screen, but render it impossibly black... (No direct mention. Intro Narrator) Places The Diadem: A wide and deep scar dug into Palisade's equator by the early Divine Principality. It promised to be a vast arcology that people could live and work in. Instead, it simply ruined the world. The Shale Belt: A low, resource-filled mountain range in the north-central of Palisade.

Additional Notes Notes on The Five Approaches by Eiden Teak Okay, so more or less, it breaks down like this: There are five \"approaches\" to how Kalmeria is used. What's Kalmeria? Well, the Kalmeria Revolution kind of bumped up everyone's power level and brought us back to the things were (supposedly) back in the Miraculous Millennium, before the Perennial Wave. \"Hey, that's not an answer to what Kalmeria is,\" you might say? And to that, I say, shut up, no one really knows how it works. But here's how people make it work ( all approach names and sketches tentative ): The Null Approach , also called the Mundane Approach uses Kalmeria and the Perennial Wave's natural technological negation attributes to basically nullify and reduce magical effects. Kesh is really keen on this, and so are a lot of us in Millennium Break. A lot of our blue collar folks, especially, like in the Oxblood Clan and Company of the Spade. Kesh weapons and Altars enhanced by the Mundane Approach seem to dampen the sound and light around them, swallowing the impact of incoming blows. The Arcane Approach blends Kalmeria with some of the older sources of power we've had for a while like our Chorus Bond, a Twilight Mirage resource called \"Q-Glass,\" Hyphan strati tech, or the Memoria which Columnar stole from us. In brief, it's very \"device\" oriented: For us, that means lots of staves, orbs, cybertomes, alchemical potions—classic conduits of power, yeah? For Columnar and the Frontier Syndicate, they often use independently moving, choreographed lots of bits, funnels, and drones—all of which produce with strange visual phenomena, like eye floaters and optical auras. The Divine Approach uses Kalmeria as a medium for calling on the power of a Divine directly and immediately. Whether that's from Nideo and the other Stels or from the Divines of the Mirage, it seems very paternalistic, but that's just my view. It really just escalates the familiar way Divines blessed Hallows, extending it to their pilots. You know: Glowing skin; fiery auras. Living wings. Both on the pilot & the mech. Nideo stuff looks statuesque and angelic. Mirage Divines are less humanoid by default, and seem to be more insectoid than normal. You can tell the difference between Nideo Divine magic and the Mirage's use because the former always smells—units report a near endless list odors associated with Nidean Altars, including ash, incense, sugar, mint, sulfur. The Profane Approach uses Kalmeria in a way similar to Motion did—which frankly, I don't love— to even more easily create things out of the raw Perennial Wave: Gaseous particles cohering and then solidifying into forms. Damaged armor bursts into liquid, then gets reformed on the simple frame. Melee weapons change shape and dimension as needed. Ranged weapons need no ammo, as it's generated by the Demiurge Engine. Used by lead companies of Stel Orion, who were allowed to salvage parts of Motion from the salvage field above Partizan since they weren't directly involved in our fight there. But also used by the Crown of Glass, whose witch has a direct relationship with Perennial. When Orion Altars are on the field, you might find yourself tasting blood or berries or something even stranger. Finally, the Elemental Approach brings together Kalmeria and the capabilities of the Branched to blend the outside world with the inside person. For the Branched themselves, this has brought them in closer conscious/experiential contact with both nature and society—those that choose to tap into Kalmeria find that they literally feel the world more. The Apostolosians, meanwhile, have performed some truly dark research on the Branched, and have used the results to reshape themselves and their war machines directly—in some way, becoming more like their hated enemies the Branched, though they haven't seemed to notice. The result is that they adopt parts of the environment as expressions of themselves in both their altars and their bodies: Summoning shields of ice, firing lightning or fire from their limbs, turning their flesh to stone, even calling storms into clear days—and when they do, nearby people ungrounded physical sensations: a finger down their back, an itch they cannot scratch, or something stuck in their eye.

      "description": "Hey everyone! Welcome to a uhmmm A BEEFY MP3!!! As a reward for our marathon live stream for the National Network of Abortion Funds, we said we'd record a podcast about William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet (1996) and BOY DID WE! Enjoy approximately three hours and fourty five minutes of Austin, Ali, Art, Jack and Sylvi chatting about Forbidden Love! Kisses! Fashion! Pools!!! BUT BEFORE THAT, we have some announcements to make about our show and our patreon. FIRST AND FOREMOST, PALISADE IS STARTING ON MARCH 9TH !!!!! WE ARE GOING TO BE DOING A DEBUT STREAM AT TWITCH.TV/FRIENDSATTHETABLE AT 8 PM ET!!!! COME HANG OUT AND BE EXCITED WITH US!!!! (The episode, of course, will also be in the feed at 8 PM!!) Second, IF YOU'RE READING THIS (THANKS) ON MARCH 4TH OR 5TH , go check out twitch.tv/rollplusbond , support Trans Lifeline and hang out while they stream some great tabletop games!!! Third, we're finally making some adjustments to our patreon! We talk about it (AT LENGTH) in this episode, but here's all the changes laid out: $1 - Clapcast. The Clapcast remains unchanged and will continue to be a monthly 20 to 30 minute collection of outtakes and interstitials from various cast recordings. Banter! Jokes! Laughs! $5 - Bluff City or equivalent produced and soundtracked actual play episode once a month . Rather than using this tier to promise more content than we can create, we're using it to focus on the best thing we make: Bluff City or a similar mini-campaign. You might be thinking \"But I love Bluff City! What other thing are they going to put here...??\" Well, after Bluff City season 2 we're planning on doing a short campaign of Realis, a tabletop system designed by Jack de Quidt and Austin Walker. We will DEFINITELY be returning for a third season of Bluff City, but we're giving this tier a little wiggle room so if we hit any road bumps with creating Bluff City, the feed will still remain consistent month to month with a bonus episode of something very cool and polished. $15 - Live at the Table sponsor + Developers \"\"Blog\"\". Instead of being apart of the $5 tier, Live at the Table is becoming a free semi-monthly Twitch stream and it is the patrons at this tier that make it possible. We'll show our appreciation by putting their names on a crawl for our Live at the Table streams and for our Twitch episode rebroadcasts (Bluff City Season 01, rebroadcasting on our twitch SOON!) This tier will also give you access to a new (currently unnamed) podcast, a monthly developers blog/behind the scenes conversation with a few cast members about whatever we've been working on! The show will be a combination of the best of our Pusher content, the vibe of the Drawing Map streams, and our deeper Tips at the Table conversations.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for distorted and layered vocals (00:30 - 01:10), discussion of workplace injuries, discussion of medical debt, and discussion of slavery and indentured servitude. For three years, the Bilateral Intercession has held Palisade under blockade. The Pact of Free States holds just beyond Nideo space, waiting in the dark for an opportunity to strike. The Qui'Err Coalition's fleet hovers at the edge of the Mirage, a flock around the Brink. Millennium Break's strike force hides in the shadow of Palisade's moon, Travertine. Something must give. Someone must move. And that is when Perennial whispers into an ear she's taken as her own, giving the Witch in Glass a new task and reminding her of an old law: Everything that has happened before will happen again. And so she moves. The Witch in Glass is fearless, and after all, she has two Divines on her side. The revivified corpse of Past and, of course, the Adversary herself. So she leads the Reflecting Pool (and its many attack wings) crashing through the blockade and driving Crystal Palace once more into the ground--albeit in a much more controlled way this time. It is only hours days after making landfall that the Witch departs the city, joined by Emmeline, her attache, but leaving behind her most loyal supporters. She leaves behind two orders: First, that they must turn their wider landing zone into a city worthy of her rule before she returns. Second, that the city must carry the name which came to her as she browsed Past's ruined archives one night, taken from a kingdom that once ruled vast expanses of the Quire desert: the Crown of Glass. And with no further words, she wanders out into the wilderness–everything that has happened before will happen again–leaving behind only a group of the ship's de facto leaders to see to the new city's repairs and re-establishment. This week on the Road to PALISADE: City Planning Department Records Recovered from the Divine, Arbitrage Factions The Bilateral Intercession: This faction, made up primarily from Stel Nideo and Kesh assets, was formerly known as the Curtain. The rebranding comes as part of a \"civil coup\" performed by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. In a move that surprised no group more than the Curtain themselves, Cynosure spent years growing in confidence and power, until that intelligence organization could be once again reduced to a tool. Still defined by their traditionalism, they wield their control on culture, religion, and history as a weapon—and the extensive spy network for which they are named when those come up short. The Pact of Free States: While the Bilateral Intercession's name change reflects a shift in leadership and posture for the Curtain, the shift from \"The Pact of Necessary Venture\" to \"The Pact of Free States\" is simply the public acceptance of what was already widely understood to be true. Led in name by Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, and in day-to-day operation by senior members of Stels Apostolos and Columnar, the Pact paint themselves as liberal reformists whose aim is to increase the degree of autonomy in each of the Stels, such that they become in reality five separate nations. Hypha & Ashen: The former were a culture of galactic nomads, guided by a paranatural force called the Strand which they could commune with using technological devices built into their antlers. The latter are their descendants, their routes broken by the Principality's expansions and occupations, their culture ripped from them. The Branched: A post-human culture from the Golden Branch star sector who have transformed their bodies into spectacular forms, but who are now weighed down by an endless war with the Principality. Persons Apparatus Aperitif (they/them), Shunley Pernard (they/them), Antonina Juris (she/her), Plum Tort (he/him), and Kojack Variety (he/him): The leading council members of the Crown in Glass, the city built from the fallen ship the Reflecting Pool. The Witch in Glass (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the body of the Divine Past. Now scours the galaxy for the lost, injured, and unsure, recruiting them into her growing city-state. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. \"Haunted\" by an old foe. Exanceaster March (he/him): Head of the vast Columnar multi-system conglomerate called the Frontier Syndicate, which is older than the Stel itself. While the Syndicate has its hands in many enterprises, the heart of it all is corralling and instrumentalizing data. One such effort, Exanceaster's pet project the March Anecdatist Foundation, set its sights on Palisade as a testing ground. Locations The Bontive Valley: When the fledgling Divine Principality left Palisade—for reasons unknown by most—those few who refused to leave (unwilling to see themselves become part of a new empire) remained in quiet isolation, blessed by the gifts of the Divine Bounty. Where that Divine is now remains a mystery. Miscellany The Perennial Wave: Perennial is something like a god, or at least I think she imagines she is. Her wave is her arrogant whim, made manifest. Functionally infinite nano-particles, spread throughout the galaxy, hampering all technology except (curiously) Divines. Kalmeria Particle: A so-called miracle of modern science, providing those that master it power akin to what was wielded before the Perennial Wave. Like most miracles, there is an explanation, but most people have neither the knowledge of nor interest in what it really is or where it came from. Some know that it is named for the rogue engineer Kal'Mera Broun, but few know that it is the result not only of their research into the divine Asepsis, but also the particular consequences of Millennium Break's battle with Motion and her siphoning of so-called \"Autonomy Itself.\" Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ), and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora and Austin Walker Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Text by Austin Walker Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) You can buy City Planning Department right here: https://kaelandm.itch.io/city-plannin...",

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for slavery and indentured servitude, kidnapping, discussion of taxidermy, blood, injury, physical harm, death, and the discussion of sports-related injuries. Here, in Somerset House, drama of the most unlikely kind is afoot. With the family fortune withering away, the Solstice clan plays host to a pair of powerful Pact dignitaries: the data-magnate Exenceaster March and the notorious Admiral Bel'Agos Bloom. They aim to draw March away from his loyalties to the Columnar with an exquisite retreat prepared by the house's staff, featuring hunting, fine dining, and other entertainment. But one after another, the unpredictable has become the occuring: A terrible accident among the hedges. The discovery of an explosive device. And next, the return of an absentee member of the household… Can Solstice House's staff turn the situation around and save the day? Or is something—like the mysterious, dark pall that surrounds the estate—due to break?

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for slavery and indentured servitude, kidnapping, discussion of taxidermy, animals bred to be hunted, blood, injury, physical harm, death, and the discussion of sports-related injuries. It is often noted that the Bilateral Commission (formerly the Curtain) is mostly comprised of people from Stels Kesh and Nideo, and likewise that the Pact is largely made up of Apostolosians and Columnar. Room is made for exceptions because, in many cases, such cases are all the more important. Thus could be the case of Exanceaster March, Columnar data magnate and long time friend of the (ever diminishing) Solstice family of Kesh. Today, the troubled aristocrats bring their powerful ally to their estate for a visit, during which they hope to persuade March to leave the Pact behind. For the Solstice family, this could be everything they need to be catapulted back into the upper crust. For their servants, it will be just one more hellish event left for them to clean up after.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for physical harm, death, and the discussion of sports-related injuries. Even as Stels Kesh and Apostolos began to fall into war, the in the year 1423 of the Perfect Millennium, the Divine Principality held the the Summer Passage of Arms on the world of Partizan, moon of Girandole. There, poets competed in verse, the Providence was run, biathletes strutted their stuff by land and by sea, and pilots wrestled their hollows against each other along the coastlines. In one such hollow was a grappler whose vision saw beyond the shore of that ill-fated moon. A man who dreamed of being something more than a athlete. A man who dreamed of being a superstar. This week on the Road to PALISADE: My Way Records Recovered from the Divine, Arbitrage Factions Principality Wrestling Association (PWA): The largest professional hollow wrestling organization in the Principality.

The PWA also maintains a \"special relationship\" with the Divine Honor, who referees all matches for the control of the Belt of Honor.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for the use of real life news audio recordings of protests and riots, cruelty, discussion of medical and student debt, discussion of combat injuries, layered conversations and heavy crosstalk. In all societies, but especially in one as vast as the Divine Principality, people are separated from history as it is made. No one can be everywhere all at once, and even if you are at the heart of a protest, in the backroom of a political dealing, or on the carrier ship as the bombers launch, presence often clouds as much as it reveals. But our only alternative is to have the world we are in coalesced and presented towards us, mediated and curated by one industrial force or another. Text books, documentaries, the nightly news, and of course… the dreaded political panel podcast. This week on the Road to PALISADE: Serious Reading Records Recovered from the Divine, Arbitrage Factions The Bilateral Intercession: This faction, made up primarily from Stel Nideo and Kesh assets, was formerly known as the Curtain. The rebranding comes as part of a \"civil coup\" performed by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh. In a move that surprised no group more than the Curtain themselves, Cynosure spent years growing in confidence and power, until that intelligence organization could be once again reduced to a tool. Still defined by their traditionalism, they wield their control on culture, religion, and history as a weapon—and the extensive spy network for which they are named when those come up short. The Pact of Free States: While the Bilateral Intercession's name change reflects a shift in leadership and posture for the Curtain, the shift from \"The Pact of Necessary Venture\" to \"The Pact of Free States\" is simply the public acceptance of what was already widely understood to be true. Led in name by Dahlia, the Glorious Princept, and in day-to-day operation by senior members of Stels Apostolos and Columnar, the Pact paint themselves as liberal reformists whose aim is to increase the degree of autonomy in each of the Stels, such that they become in reality five separate nations. Persons Continental Countinghouse (he/him): CENTRE/line host who specializes in playful monologues, managing social equilibrium, and ad reads. Pregoria Prilt (she/her): CENTRE/line panel member from Stel Columnar with a great interest in eating utensils and ancient Earth. Reatta Fossick (they/them): CENTER/Line panel member from Stel Kesh whose expertise in economic matters is only eclipsed by their deftness with euphemisms. Galaebalus Splu-u-mp (Gal/Gals, they them): CENTRE/line panel from Stel Apostolos member with strong feelings about work ethic, lunch sandwiches, and freedom. Locations 10th Coronet: A metropolitan space station—shaped like a crown, orbiting a dying sun—deep in the heart of Stel Orion, home to the galaxy's largest stock market, the stel's governing body, and its media industry. TSYU: A university with one of the galaxy's most prestigious medical schools, whose director, Jellicle (she/her), has little experience in any field except advertising.. Formerly called \"TCYU,\" prior to a recent acquisition and branding change. Articles Orion Trade Concordance: A treaty signed by all five Stels, allowing for the safe and free movement of Stel Orion ships doing business anywhere in the Principality. On paper, this allows old trade lanes to remain active and for shipping of necessary goods to go uninterrupted by the ever-spreading civil war. In practice, it gives Stel Orion a tighter-than-ever hold on galactic commerce, and provides cover for a great deal of illegal activity. It was well negotiated, don't you think?

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for cults, depiction of a missing child, gun violence, hallucination, imagery made from blood, and non-gory but uncanny body horror. Floating at the very edge of the sunset-hued safety of the Twilight Mirage, the Brink hums and pulses, a beacon of community and solidarity in an age when both are under threat. All aboard the station, staff, civilians, and visitors work side by side to maintain a sanctuary that faces ever sharper threat. Practiced pilots ferry shipments. The starships-turned-station districts groan and clank at regular interveals. Giant mechanical bodies—of shapes recognizable and imagined—are repurposed, exchanging civil processes for military procedures, And when those here in the Brink—bartenders and gardeners, fixers and musicians, assassins and preists—see these machines from the corner of their eyes, they find themselves wondering: Can this nebula of peace and egality they've built remain safe in its orbit, far above the dirt and muck of the world they left beyond? Or must they face a hard truth: Gather enough loose particles together, no matter their essence or color or direction, and they will take that old, familiar shape. The shape of empire. Records Recovered from the Divine, Arbitrage Factions The Curtain of Divinity: Largely aligned to Stels Kesh and Nideo, the Curtain of Divinity is made uup of those loyal to Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh, the Peaceful Princept, and who desire the Divine Principality to continue on as it has for millenia.

Some even claim that they would see the Principality utterly destroyed and replaced by a loose affiliation of free states. Brink Proxy: The volunteers who function as mechanics, operators, janitors, and engineers for the Brink. Bureaucratic, but some tasks require such things. Orchard Syndicate: A group of gardeners, farmers, and their delivery unit. Specialize in oranges and hidden motivations. The Devotees (aka the Friends of Devotion) : A cultish organization that some suspect is responsible for those who have gone missing recently. Seems to worship something called either Devotion or Fervor. Qui Err Coalition: Comprised of the descendents (literal, metaphorical, and mystical) of the planet Quire's original people, the Qui Err Coalition is the de facto government of the Twilight Mirage. Persons Cheal Pushy (he/him): While his single biggest influence on the Brink was the founding of the ever spreading Community Gardens, he's mostly known as the heart of the station, operating everyone's favorite dive bar and venue, Pushy's. Mustard Red (she/her): A cyborg member of the Brink Proxy. A little paranoid, but perfectly tuned for a role in surveillance. Oh, and quite eager. A useful trait.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for cults, depiction of a missing child, gun violence, hallucination, imagery made from blood, and non-gory but uncanny body horror. The announcement was bright, loud, and unilateral: the Twilight Mirage would not allow the Divine Principality—in any of its forms—to move one step further. Now, though, in the afterglow of such a vibrant declaration, reality has begun to sink in. General Mourning attempts to sift through fact, opinion, and advice. Pushy, Mustard, and 3T head to Devotion's retreat—each bringing their unique vulnerability with them. The assassin who goes by \"Deutsch Synchro\" pursues a risky side objective. And as many Troublemakers heed the belligerent call of their idol, Paris France and his rival False Fruit rush to stop the innocent from being caught up in the wake.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for the discussion of colonial violence, discussion of death from visual stimulus, depiction of cults, and the discussion of industrial and workplace industries. For the last five millennia, the Divine Principality has expanded its reach across the stars. But in the Twilight Mirage, those 5,000 years were only felt as 500. For those in the Mirage, led by the Qui Err Coalition, life has been stable and if not utopian, then at least a type of living that is aspirational in only the best ways. But today, as the space station known as the Brink orbits towards the edge of the false nebula, those 5000 years come rushing in. This week on the Road to Palisade: Orbital Pt. 1 Records Recovered from the Divine, Arbitrage Factions The Curtain of Divinity: For generations, the Curtain of Divinity operated in the shadows of the Principality, partly as intelligence agency, partly as shadow government. Now they have been dragged into the daylight, and serve as one of the two ruling factions of the whole Principality. Though there are some divisions along questions of secularity, humanism, and cultural taste, in general, leaders of the Curtain are conservative, traditionalist, and nationalistic. They seek the reunification of all five Stels and the permanence of the Divine Principality. Led, in public at least, by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh, the Peaceful Princept. In fact, the Curtain has five divisions, each led by a ruthless individual known only by a codename: Silk (diplomacy), Damask (research & inquisition), Lace (military), Linen (economics), and Gabardine (espionage and collaboration). The Pact of Necessary Venture: As their (current) name suggests, the Pact began as a cooperative exploratory committee founded in the late 14th Century of the Perfect Millennium. They sought new territory to conquer, breaking an old taboo in the process, and inviting destruction and fracture. Which is appropriate, as their vision for the future is one where each Stel is granted more autonomy and independence—some even claim that they would see the Principality utterly destroyed and replaced by a loose affiliation of free states. Despite this, the Pact are no radicals: While they want more independence from the Principality, they have little interest in shaking up the internal power structures of the Stels themselves. After all, their founders were all Elects, and though only two remain (Gallica, elect of the Divine Present, and Rye, elect of the divine Space), they are led by Dahlia, who serves as both Apokine and Glorious Princept. Qui Err Coalition: Comprised of the descendents (literal, metaphorical, and mystical) of the planet Quire's original people, the Qui Err Coalition is the de facto government of the Twilight Mirage. Brink Proxy: The volunteers who function as mechanics, operators, janitors, and engineers for the Brink. Bureaucratic, but some tasks require such things. Orchard Syndicate: A group of gardeners, farmers, and their delivery unit. Specialize in oranges and hidden motivations. Devotion: A cultish organization that some suspect is responsible for those who have gone missing recently. Persons Cheal Pushy (he/him): While his single biggest influence on the Brink was the founding of the ever spreading Community Gardens, he's mostly known as the heart of the station, operating everyone's favorite dive bar and venue, Pushy's. Mustard Red (she/her): A cyborg member of the Brink Proxy. A little paranoid, but perfectly tuned for a role in surveillance. Oh, and quite eager. A useful trait. Paris France (he/him): The Brink is a hub, with countless things moving through its halls and ports. Paris France is the person you go to when you want access to those things, even when you shouldn't have it. Deutsch Synchro a.k.a. Lament (they/she): A simple bartender at Pushy's. That's all. Certainly not an asset in play. Teleos Triton Tanager a.k.a. 3T (he/him): A idealist, a fool, and a musician with a following of \"Troublemakers.\" Grey Gloaming (she/her) and Demani Dusk (she/er): Most know these long past wives as the founders of the Brink. But from my perspective, they were interlopers in history. Grand Magnificent (he/him): An \"artist\" (read: weapons manufacturer) from five centuries ago. The picture of arrogance. He was at his best when he was honest about what he was. Locations The Brink: A space station and transport hub that orbits the outer edge of the Twilight Mirage. Articles The \"Divine\" Arbit: A machine that twists and spins and twirls in impossible to predict ways—making it a poison to prediction engines. To call it a Divine though. What a joke. Miscellany The Perennial Wave: Perennial is something like a god, or at least I think she imagines she is. Her wave is her arrogant whim, made manifest. Functionally infinite nano-particles, spread throughout the galaxy, hampering all technology except (curiously) Divines.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for discussion of displaced and unhoused communities. The news is sour. The revolutonaries known as Millennium Break will be no one's savior today. The Ashen of Saboria, of Harborview, have only each other as their protectors. And as they huddle below, sheltered in the shuddering mountain, the enemy arrives from above. The mission is clear in both objective and absurdity: Zark Vapor, Teasel Fauna, Martia Häske, and Narmine Te'Ketch must simply hold the Pact at bay long enough for a miracle. This week on the Road to PALISADE: Lancer Pt. 3 Records Recovered from the Divine, Arbitrage Factions Hypha & Ashen: The former were a culture of galactic nomads, guided by a paranatural force called the Strand which they could commune with using technological devices built into their antlers. The latter are their descendants, their routes broken by the Principality's expansions and occupations, their culture ripped from them. Stel Columnar: Famously \"courted\" by the growing Principality many generations ago, this nation of humanoid synthetics traded freedom for the prestige and security of the Principality. They hid behind imperial walls and pursued the Future, pushing boundaries not only in technology, but in art, commerce, and war. I suppose I can call them cousins, but not with much fondness. Today, they share righteous screeds and fight for the return of something like democracy as part of the Pact of Necessary Venture. What a comedy. The Curtain of Divinity: For generations, the Curtain of Divinity operated in the shadows of the Principality, partly as intelligence agency, partly as shadow government. Now they have been dragged into the daylight, and serve as one of the two ruling factions of the whole Principality. Though there are some divisions along questions of secularity, humanism, and cultural taste, in general, leaders of the Curtain are conservative, traditionalist, and nationalistic. They seek the reunification of all five Stels and the permanence of the Divine Principality. Led, in public at least, by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh, the Peaceful Princept.

In the city of Harborview, on the world of Saboria, a group of Ashen refugees tried to make new lives for themselves. In the process, they connected to the history of their people—the ancient Hypha—and rediscovered an ancient art: the creation of strati. This was all it took for the Pact of Necessary Venture to close the snare around them.

For the Hypha and Ashen refugees who make it their home, the city of Harborview on the world of Saboria represents possibility. As they fled from the Curtain, Stel Columnar reached out to offer them haven. A place on a world of their own to rebuild. A material gift, \"proving\" the Pact's commitment to reform. And for some time, the community of Harborview was allowed to flourish. But today, that time has ended. Some of their most precious residents have been kidnapped.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for mentions of death, poison, discussion of bodily fluids, and slavery. With the Bontive Valley and the Shale Belt behind them, Millennium Break's first arrivals on Palisade find themselves facing their most delicate situation yet. In the arid stretches beyond the Curtain's reach, there rests a fortress named Joyous Guard. Inside lives the previous imperial ruler of this world: Perpetual Lustre, the Duke of Glass. Unwilling to cede the power he claimed to \"protect\" on behalf of the long-absent Princept, the Duke now lives in exile, attended to by an unctuous court and served by the supposedly leashed \"descendents\" of Divines known as Delegates. But with Millennium Break newly arrived, for how much longer will this petty tyrant yet cast his shadow over the desert? This week on the Road to PALISADE: Wagon Wheel Pt. 3 Records Recovered from the Divine, Arbitrage Factions The Curtain of Divinity: For generations, the Curtain of Divinity operated in the shadows of the Principality, partly as intelligence agency, partly as shadow government. After the events on Partizan, they were dragged into the daylight, and served as one of the two ruling factions of the whole Principality. But as the years progressed, and Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh, the Peaceful Princept, grew in confidence and skill, the group began a steady transformation and the spies began to return to the shadows… New Earth Hegemony: Long since lost to history, the NEH once claimed the entire center sphere of the Galaxy as their home. Characterized by a neoliberal policies and the deep belief in technological solutions, the nation was key to the slow destruction of the ancient Divine Fleet, a predecessor to the Divine Free States (itself half of the Divine Principality's founding membership). The Fabreal Duchy: When the nascent Divine Principality left Palisade behind 5000 years ago, they left behind the Fabreal Duchy. At the time, the Duchy was an extension of the Twilight Mirage's technologically powerful artist-kingdom, the Crown of Glass. Whether it was this connection or something else, the Princept at the time believed them to be ideal candidates to remain behind and tend to the Palisade in the Principality's absence. In time though, these \"custodians\" refashioned themselves as crystalline royals—quite literally. The bodies of the royals and aristocrats of the duchy are made of strange glass-like material, and their selfhood is actually contained in a colorful oil—produced and maintained by the Divine Unction , which flows through their vessels. In time, the Duchy expanded its grasp and became the largest single power on the planet. Its peerage—a collection of baronesses, counts, and other nobles who serve under the Duke's whims—are protected by their Saints, a chivalric order of knights who pilot hollows of smaller design than those of the Principality, and served by a large number of \"Delegates.\" enslaved slivers from DIvines long since vanished. Before the Principality arrived on Palisade again, Perpetual Lustre, the Duke of Glass led the duchy. But when he refused to submit to the will of the newly arrived Viceroy, his vassals saw opportunity and betrayed him. Now he lives exiled at the edge of the desert. Persons Ce Gull (they/he): A scout who grew up on a Nidean outpost and joined up with Millennium Break after their home was destroyed by Stel Orio. They're working on their skills as a gardener. Caeso Wair (he/him): A horse, a cannon, a quiet confidence. There are many ways to be a cowboy. The News of Her Arrival Flowed Between the People of the Village Like ⸢Wine⸣, Rich and Intoxicating (they/them): \"Excerpt\" of the seemingly absence Divine, Bounty . Excerpts are, of course, like Elects or Candidates before them, except they're egotistical enough that they have to think of themselves as priests instead of pilots. Broadleaf (he/him): A musician and aspiring chef who towers above others in an elephantine frame. Perhaps you might call him the heart of this crew. A dreamer, for sure. Perpetual Lustre, the Duke of Glass (he/him): Exiled erstwhile leader of the Fabreal Duchy, now residing in Joyous Guard. Bright Mercy (she/her): Delegate serving Perpetual Lustre as court attendant of Joyous Guard.. August Righteousness (he/they): Delegate serving as court chef of Joyous Guard.

Delegates: Oh what a fun and failed experiment these pathetic beings are. In its earliest days, before the Principality learned how to use Gumption's unique talents to keep Divines from finding permanent death, they attempted instead to carve us down into little slivers of ourselves. Did they think they were slicing butter, I wonder? Did they not understand that we are not content but process ? Not numbers, but formula? That we exist in a sort of algorithmic concentrate , and that to shave away a part drastically changes the whole that is produced by our very being? Apparently not, since they tried this inevitable mistake anyway. These \"Delegates\" are the result, and they are not charmless, despite being abominations. They carry some of our cleverness and commitment and power in those ugly, humanoid frames, and bear (I admit) some resemblance to the Divines from which they were, in their strange way, spawned. Their names reflect this: Gentle Influence, Cruel Emphasis, Limited Dissent—and yes, they are thus tempered forms of what the Divine once was. There will, of course, never be a \"Moderate Arbitrage\" or any such nonsense, I will assure this.

      "description": "The members of Millenium Break continue to investigate the world of Palisade, trying to build relationships across the communities of Eversin and Braunton. In the former, they learn that offers of direct help may not always be easily accepted by those in the sights of an occupation. In the latter, they learn that direct occupation is not always necessary for an empire's reach to be felt. And in both, they come to understand the importance of local culture (basketball) and social ritual (potluck dinner) when it comes to building a movement.

After the events on Partizan, they were dragged into the daylight, and served as one of the two ruling factions of the whole Principality. But as the years progressed, and Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh, the Peaceful Princept, grew in confidence and skill, the group began a steady transformation and the spies began to return to the shadows… New Earth Hegemony: Long since lost to history, the NEH once claimed the entire center sphere of the Galaxy as their home.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for violence, death, and colonization. For the first few years of the war, those in the central depths of Nideo space felt safe. In order to reach them, the Pact would first have to push through an unthinkable amount of territory—much of it well defended. What they did not expect was an Apostolosian sneak attack arriving through the deep space that separates two galactic arms. And when they arrived, it was not simply an invasion. It was an invitation to a morbid race: Who would conquer Palisade—and the Twilight Mirage Beyond—first. At the forefront of this conflict, two pilots arose. This is their story. This week on the Road to Palisade: Last Shooting Records Recovered from the Divine, Arbitrage Factions Stel Nideo: WIth origins in the long lost Twilight Mirage, Stel Nideo are architects of our current era, dread controllers of the Present. Along with shaping mass media, popular culture, and educational standards, they now operate both Received and Progressive Asterism, the former run by the corrupt Cycle and the latter by the grotesque puppet of the lost prophet Gur Sevraq. These priests, pop idols, and patriotic poster children are largely aligned with the Curtain of Divinity. Stel Orion: For hundreds of thousands of years, Stel Orion—under countless names and forms—has repeated a cycle of exploitation and revolution. Competing spirits of individualism and camaraderie ebb and flow, but industry remains. Is it any wonder that it remains associated with the raw breadth of Space itself? Currently, Orion is at war with itself, with countless small factions not only differing in position on the larger civil war in the Principality, but also on many additional issues like wealth, religion, and culture. Stel Apostolos : An ancient people, ever obsessed with external conquest and internal freedom, and utterly uninterested in understanding their own contradictions. They are dedicated to the pursuit of forward Motion, and I suppose I can respect such bullheaded devotion. It is, at the very least, not boring. They are the meat and muscle of the Pact of Necessary Venture. The Curtain of Divinity: For generations, the Curtain of Divinity operated in the shadows of the Principality, partly as intelligence agency, partly as shadow government. Now they have been dragged into the daylight, and serve as one of the two ruling factions of the whole Principality. Though there are some divisions along questions of secularity, humanism, and cultural taste, in general, leaders of the Curtain are conservative, traditionalist, and nationalistic. They seek the reunification of all five Stels and the permanence of the Divine Principality. Led, in public at least, by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh, the Peaceful Princept. In fact, the Curtain has five divisions, each led by a ruthless individual known only by a codename: Silk (diplomacy), Damask (research & inquisition), Lace (military), Linen (economics), and Gabardine (espionage and collaboration). The Pact of Necessary Venture: As their (current) name suggests, the Pact began as a cooperative exploratory committee founded in the late 14th Century of the Perfect Millennium. They sought new territory to conquer, breaking an old taboo in the process, and inviting destruction and fracture. Which is appropriate, as their vision for the future is one where each Stel is granted more autonomy and independence—some even claim that they would see the Principality utterly destroyed and replaced by a loose affiliation of free states. Despite this, the Pact are no radicals: While they want more independence from the Principality, they have little interest in shaking up the internal power structures of the Stels themselves. After all, their founders were all Elects, and though only two remain (Gallica, elect of the Divine Present, and Rye, elect of the divine Space), they are led by Dahlia, who serves as both Apokine and Glorious Princept. Persons Cor'rina Corrine (cor/cors): Drawing cor root name for the Eidolon Corridor , a famed Apostolosian peace maker, is it any wonder that Cor'rina Corrine, ace pilot of the Pact's forces near Palisade, is a naive idealist? Misericorde 'Miseri' (he/they): Heir to a disgraced family who sided with the rebellious Sovereign Immunity once known as The Farmer. Seeks to restore his family's name by any means necessary. Dahlia (they/them): The self-proclaimed \"Glorious Princept\" and Apokine of Apostolos has the support of the Pact of Venture, yet seems more concerned with winning the war against the Branched than attending to the civil war inside of the Principality. Dahlia is the elect not only of Integrity but also Commitment . A feat, a folly, or both? Locations The Skarnoc Debris Fields: The remnants of a battle from the era before the Twilight Mirage, where the Rapid Evening fought and lost the Divine Nobility. Besides the normal ship debris, the field has gathered strange crystalline spires. Articles The Portcullis System & The Divine Space: Huge, distended hexagonal gates that float at the edge of key systems throughout the Principality. Once a week—or more often, if one has the keys to the kingdom—each one connects to one other, forming a faster-than-light highway that serves as the logistical backbone of the galaxy. Built by Orion, the technology is a perversion of that used by some of the earliest Divines, tens of thousands of years. Miscellany The Perennial Wave: Perennial is something like a god, or at least I think she imagines she is. Her wave is her arrogant whim, made manifest. Functionally infinite nano-particles, spread throughout the galaxy, hampering all technology except (curiously) Divines. Kalmeria Particle: A so-called miracle of modern science, providing those that master it power akin to what was wielded before the Perennial Wave. Like most miracles, there is an explanation, but most people have neither the knowledge of nor interest in what it really is or where it came from. Some know that it is named for the rogue engineer Kal'Mera Broun, but few know that it is the result not only of their research into the divine Asepsis, but also the particular consequences of Millennium Break's battle with Motion and her siphoning of so-called \"Autonomy Itself.\" Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) and Sylvia Clare Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Text by Austin Walker Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) You can purchase Last Shooting at https://my-name-is-grant.itch.io/last-shooting",

      "description": "Once a year, the Divine Discernment takes a trip dangerously close to the Adversary—Perennial—orbiting the very core of the galaxy. From there, it can see everything, all at once, breaking the rules of time and space in exactly the ways Divines seem sometimes able to do. It saves this view, rendering it out as an image impossibly high in resolution, giving those with access to it incredible strategic and tactical advantages—so long as they generally know where to look and what to look for. As such, though Devotion itself is not a dedicated war vessel, it is as responsible for the deaths that follow it as the accurate sight of the rifle or the targeting computer of the missle are. \"Perhaps,\" the leaders of Millennium Break think, \"we could put it to better use.\" This week on the Road to PALISADE: Stealing the Throne Records Recovered from the Divine, Arbitrage Factions The Divine Principality: Stitched together thousands of years ago from the remains of the Divine Free States and the Principality of Kesh, it is largest empire in the history of the MIlky Way Galaxy. Even now, divided against itself, any subdivision of its arms stretches further than any kingdom or confederation ever has before. An utter failure. Stel Nideo: WIth origins in the long lost Twilight Mirage, Stel Nideo are architects of our current era, dread controllers of the Present. Along with shaping mass media, popular culture, and educational standards, they now operate both Received and Progressive Asterism, the former run by the corrupt Cycle and the latter by the grotesque puppet of the lost prophet Gur Sevraq. These priests, pop idols, and patriotic poster children are largely aligned with the Curtain of Divinity. Stel Apostolos : An ancient people, ever obsessed with external conquest and internal freedom, and utterly uninterested in understanding their own contradictions. They are dedicated to the pursuit of forward Motion, and I suppose I can respect such bullheaded devotion. It is, at the very least, not boring. They are the meat and muscle of the Pact of Necessary Venture. Hypha & Ashen: The former were a culture of galactic nomads, guided by a paranatural force called the Strand which they could commune with using technological devices built into their antlers. The latter are their descendants, their routes broken by the Principality's expansions and occupations, their culture ripped from them. Persons Discernment (it/its) and Vigna (they/them): Vigna is egotistical with little reason to be, but Discernment could stand to be a little prouder. It is a massive Divine that seeks to put the world in its gaze, in every possible version of that statement. Part galactic spy satellite, part museum, part military base. It really tests the boundaries between passive observer and active agent, doesn't it? Omi (they/them): A synthetic member of Millennium Break with a top-shelf scenario simulation engine and an unparalleled sense of precision timing (among other beings of their type, at least). Kinoki (sher/her): A code-cracking algorithm that slowly turned into a master thief and hacker. Strange life, even to me. Fingers Crossed (they/them): One might wonder just how this criminal and rebel has studied enough classified Principality material to become the export forger that they are. Yes. One might wonder. Robet Shpache (he/him): An expert in security systems, Robet Shpache wields cameras, gates, and drones like weapons. Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh (he/him): \"The Peaceful Princept,\" supposed leader of the Curtain of Divinity. Growing, ever so slowly, into the title. The Lace of the Curtain of Divinity: Marshall in command of the Curtain's military forces, including reconnaissance and martial saboteur units. Locations Crown: The ancient homeworld of the Columnar, found deep into the coreward reaches of the Sagittarius arm of the galaxy. It was devastated by the arrival of the Perennial Wave, and today remains ruined. Miscellany The Perennial Wave: Perennial is something like a god, or at least I think she imagines she is. Her wave is her arrogant whim, made manifest. Functionally infinite nano-particles, spread throughout the galaxy, hampering all technology except (curiously) Divines.

The Divine Fealty knew what they had seen instantly, identifying it in something before or beyond language. Appropriate, since the Twilight Mirage, once its home, had always been more than just a simple place or a proper noun. It did not matter if their elect, Veronique, could understand what they'd seen in this way, only that she would support Fealty in what must be done. And so, an escape. And so, a kingdom among debris. And so, a kidnapping. And so, a confrontation between Divines. Now wounded, the two Anchors float back in the direction they came from, drawing ever closer to the purple dot in the distance. This week on Friends at the Table: The Road to PALISADE: HOUNDs Pt. 2 Records Recovered from the Divine, Arbitrage Factions The Divine Principality: Stitched together thousands of years ago from the remains of the Divine Free States and the Principality of Kesh, it is largest empire in the history of the MIlky Way Galaxy. Even now, divided against itself, any subdivision of its arms stretches further than any kingdom or confederation ever has before. An utter failure. Stel Kesh: Among the oldest operating powers in the stars. Devoted to the Past even though they've long lost control of the Divine who shares its name. Snobbish historians, ineffective parliamentarians, and stubborn reactionaries. Kesh is generally aligned with the Curtain of Divinity. Stel Nideo: WIth origins in the long lost Twilight Mirage, Stel Nideo are architects of our current era, dread controllers of the Present. Along with shaping mass media, popular culture, and educational standards, they now operate both Received and Progressive Asterism, the former run by the corrupt Cycle and the latter by the grotesque puppet of the lost prophet Gur Sevraq. These priests, pop idols, and patriotic poster children are largely aligned with the Curtain of Divinity. Stel Orion: For hundreds of thousands of years, Stel Orion—under countless names and forms—has repeated a cycle of exploitation and revolution. Competing spirits of individualism and camaraderie ebb and flow, but industry remains. Is it any wonder that it remains associated with the raw breadth of Space itself? Currently, Orion is at war with itself, with countless small factions not only differing in position on the larger civil war in the Principality, but also on many additional issues like wealth, religion, and culture. Stel Columnar: Famously \"courted\" by the growing Principality many generations ago, this nation of humanoid synthetics traded freedom for the prestige and security of the Principality. They hid behind imperial walls and pursued the Future, pushing boundaries not only in technology, but in art, commerce, and war. I suppose I can call them cousins, but not with much fondness. Today, they share righteous screeds and fight for the return of something like democracy as part of the Pact of Necessary Venture. What a comedy. Stel Apostolos : An ancient people, ever obsessed with external conquest and internal freedom, and utterly uninterested in understanding their own contradictions. They are dedicated to the pursuit of forward Motion, and I suppose I can respect such bullheaded devotion. It is, at the very least, not boring. They are the meat and muscle of the Pact of Necessary Venture. The Curtain of Divinity: For generations, the Curtain of Divinity operated in the shadows of the Principality, partly as intelligence agency, partly as shadow government. Now they have been dragged into the daylight, and serve as one of the two ruling factions of the whole Principality. Though there are some divisions along questions of secularity, humanism, and cultural taste, in general, leaders of the Curtain are conservative, traditionalist, and nationalistic. They seek the reunification of all five Stels and the permanence of the Divine Principality. Led, in public at least, by Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh, the Peaceful Princept. In fact, the Curtain has five divisions, each led by a ruthless individual known only by a codename: Silk (diplomacy), Damask (research & inquisition), Lace (military), Linen (economics), and Gabardine (espionage and collaboration). The Pact of Necessary Venture: As their (current) name suggests, the Pact began as a cooperative exploratory committee founded in the late 14th Century of the Perfect Millennium. They sought new territory to conquer, breaking an old taboo in the process, and inviting destruction and fracture. Which is appropriate, as their vision for the future is one where each Stel is granted more autonomy and independence—some even claim that they would see the Principality utterly destroyed and replaced by a loose affiliation of free states. Despite this, the Pact are no radicals: While they want more independence from the Principality, they have little interest in shaking up the internal power structures of the Stels themselves. After all, their founders were all Elects, and though only two remain (Gallica, elect of the Divine Present, and Rye, elect of the divine Space), they are led by Dahlia, who serves as both Apokine and Glorious Princept. Millennium Break: Terrorists, thieves, and revolutionaries. Founded on the moon of Partizan in 1423-1424 PM. A wrench in the wheel, a fly in the ointment. Critical in pushing the Principality into chaos. Now spreading dissidence through the galaxy. Their manifesto, such as it is, is thus: We will help those displaced by the war. We will claim supplies only when it adds losses to the ledgers of the unjust. Free and fair elections will be held every two years. Burn thrones, build tables. When we provide for ourselves, we can provide for others. We will not turn our back on allies in need. If we must play their game, make sure to bloody their noses. When we reach the edge, we will Leap. Look sick as shit. The words of children. Persons Veronique (she/they): Elect of Fealty. A loyalist. A protector. A runner, in a previous life. Fealty (any, they/them): A Curtain Divine of glittering chrome and sculpture. Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh (he/him): \"The Peaceful Princept,\" supposed leader of the Curtain of Divinity. Growing, ever so slowly, into the title. Pressure Cove (they/them): Captain of the Fox in the Snow and leader of a group infatuated with Fealty and their promised way of life. Gucci Garantine (she/her): Once, when she operated the revolutionary group HORIZON, true heir of the Rapid Evening, she called herself Saint Dawn. Now she simply calls herself one of the MIllennium Break's commanders, albeit through gritted teeth. Conviction (she/her) & Amaryllis (they/them): Conviction is among the proudest of all Kesh Divines, a caped, golden, horse-knight who speaks with absolute confidence. Their elect, Amaryllis, spent years in the shadow of Veronique, their junior in all things. Until now, of course. Fortitude (it/its) & Acacia (they/them): A Divine from an era before my own, and in that way at least, a curiosity. It spreads its strength across many military units. As always, its need for an Elect is a disappointment. Locations The Skarnoc Debris Fields: The remnants of a battle from the era before the Twilight Mirage, where the Rapid Evening fought and lost the Divine Nobility. Besides the normal ship debris, the field has gathered strange crystalline spires. Articles A Dash of Purple: Fealty, of course, knew what it was at once. How could they not? Hollows & Hallows: Mechanized military vessels, often in humanoid shape. The latter are enhanced by the touch of a Divine. Miscellany The Perennial Wave: Perennial is something like a god, or at least I think she imagines she is. Her wave is her arrogant whim, made manifest. Functionally infinite nano-particles, spread throughout the galaxy, hampering all technology except (curiously) Divines. Kalmeria Particle: A so-called miracle of modern science, providing those that master it power akin to what was wielded before the Perennial Wave. Like most miracles, there is an explanation, but most people have neither the knowledge of nor interest in what it really is or where it came from. Some know that it is named for the rogue engineer Kal'Mera Broun, but few know that it is the result not only of their research into the divine Asepsis, but also the particular consequences of Millennium Break's battle with Motion and her siphoning of so-called \"Autonomy Itself.\" Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ) and Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Text by Austin Walker Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot )",

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for violence, abduction, and risk of suffocation. Welcome to the Road to PALISADE, an interlude connecting PARTIZAN to PALISADE, our upcoming season (which will be played in Armour Astir: Advent by Briar Sovereign)! Unlike 2019's Road to PARTIZAN , please know that this season will likely contain broad spoilers for COUNTER/Weight, Twilight Mirage, and PARTIZAN. In many ways, we see both the Road to PALISADE and PALISADE itself as opportunities to weave many important threads from the Divine Cycle together. Another way in which this interlude season is different from the Road to PARTIZAN is that we aren't necessarily telling a linear history from point A to point B. While many key points on the five years separating the two seasons will be hit, the Road to PALISADE is intended to be less of a direct history and more of a series of snapshots, capturing events happening as the Principality's civil war continues. As a fun note, all of the stories we play this interlude season are generally inspired by the cast's answers to Crunchyroll writer Adam Wescott's question about what sort of PZN spinoff we'd all want to do! There are (thus far) two exceptions, and this episode is the first of those. When I first read Tyler Crumrine's HOUNDs , I knew instantly that this was how I wanted to kick things off. And as you'll see, Jack and Art proved that it was the right decision. Okay, given how long this particular Road is going to be—it's still in production as this first episode hits the main feed—I better shut up and let you get on with listening. This week on Friends at the Table: The Road to PALISADE: Hounds Pt. 1 Records Recovered from the Divine, Arbitrage Factions The Divine Principality: Stitched together thousands of years ago from the remains of the Divine Free States and the Principality of Kesh, it is largest empire in the history of the MIlky Way Galaxy.

Hollows & Hallows: Mechanized military vessels, often in humanoid shape. The latter are enhanced by the touch of a Divine. The Treaty of Permanent Peace: An agreement of terms and conventions between the Curtain and the Pact, negotiated by the Elect Rye and the Peaceful Princept. By all accounts, this was the first great achievement of the latter. Without the safeties, guidelines, and structure provided by the Treaty, the less technologically advanced Curtain would have lost the war within the first two years of its start, with countless civilians left dead across core Curtain worlds.

      "description": "Well, I suppose I've got a story or two left in these old bones. And hell, since it is another one about Marielda, why not make one about stories and the people who tell 'em. Now I know what you might be thinking: Physicality alive, in the era that The Six operated in Marielda, it was knowledge which was forbidden, turned into contraband and currency both, not stories. But as anyone ever wounded by art can tell you, fiction is a sharper knife than information could be. And living fiction, played out in front of your eyes and ears? Very few things are as well honed as that. And so it was that Samothes, ever jealous and increasingly suspicious that his erstwhile beau might conquer his capital with culture instead cudgel, all but forbade the theater. Of course, any scoundrel worth their shadow would narrow in on those two words preceding \"forbade\": \"All but. \" There were two exceptions to the rule banning theater. The first was liturgical drama, approved by the Blessed Council and performed in the True Church of Samothes on the Day of High Sun and other feasts. Between us, these were boring. They might serve academic value to someone of today's New Archives, and I suppose for the true believer of that old era, seeing even the most sanitized depiction of their King-God, Artificer Divine would make their day. But most folks, they wanted something a little less sacramental. Which is where the second exception comes in. Once a season, as an act of supposed Good Will, the Preceptors of the Font of True Knowledge—the Fontmen—opened the gates of their domain and put on a grand show. A day of comedy and tragedy in the Font Theater—the leash let slack so that the next time those censors pulled on it, they could claim it was done in good faith. What does any of this have to do with the Six. Well, nothin, until those out-a-towners with mysterious pasts and glorious masks showed up, claiming they had a spot on the stage and job for Hitchcock, Castille, and the rest. Help those actors steal their names back. Hello everyone!! Here is our livestream marathon finale game, a return to Marielda playing Scene Thieves!

      "description": "Princeton, The Powdered Sugar Horse \"Only a fool would say the horse does not belong at the beach,\" wrote a young Elliott Callahan in 1885. \"The British, in their usual parsimonious fashion, insist that the beach is the province of the donkey, but the fact of the matter is that as far as strength, determination, and grit are concerned: one can do no wrong by bringing the horse—America's workhorse, if you will—down to the waterfront.\" By 1897, horses were a regular sight on the Bluff City boardwalk. Carriah and Letitia dragged the boat launch down to the water and back. Maribeth stood patiently by the bicycle rental stand and blinked placidly at passing cyclists. The less about Big Arthur that is committed to the historical record, the better. The most beloved of these animals, however, was Princeton: the mild mannered Clydesdale who pulled the Princeton Powdered Sugar wagon. Though whether he was named after the company or vice versa is a matter of some dispute, his sweet temper and calm demeanour is not. In the summer of that same year, Callahan—still clearly an equestrian enthusiast—catalogued this song in commemoration of the animal. Princeton the Powdered Sugar Horse, Is coming by again! Princeton the Powdered Sugar Horse, With flowers in his mane! If ever God made the sweetest creature, So sublime in every feature, Who would it be? Of course! It's The Powdered Sugar Horse! Princeton the Powdered Sugar Horse, They say he's a businessman! Princeton the Powdered Sugar Horse, As only an equine can! Tho' there's often a fellow who stands beside him, Sells the sugar and helps to guide him, Who runs the show? Of course! It's the Powdered Sugar Horse! Princeton the Powdered Sugar Horse, The children clap and cheer! Princeton the Powdered Sugar Horse, Whenever he draws near! They say that he's never bit a man, And only God knows if he even can. Would he pummel a villain? Of course! He's the Powdered Sugar Horse!

Enterprising organ grinders would charge participants a small sum, hand out a broadsheet, and then act as an accompanist to a lovesick singer. These proved wildly unpopular. The songs were never particularly emotive, the cost was slightly too high, but the primary nail in the coffin was that it turned out that nobody liked to be sung to - in public - by a potential beau (who was invariably fighting the volume of a barrel organ two feet away). Most of these songs had faded into obscurity by the time Elliott Callahan, in 1899, recorded \"Three Out of Five It Ain't Bad\", a song that fails - straightforwardly - at communicating anything about love, or indeed anything at all. I wish I could give you the crown on the head Of the Queen out in Olde London Town! I wish I could send you the brooches that shine Of the Princess of Burgundy's gown. But all I can offer's the love in my heart, You can make me the happiest lad! I can offer this music, companionship too, And hey, three out of five it ain't bad. Three out of five, three out of five, Three out of five it ain't bad (it ain't bad!) Three out of five it ain't bad, my love, Three out of five it ain't bad. I wish we could visit the fanciest stores, I would buy you such satin and lace. I wish we could hike, hand in hand, through the Alps, See the wintry sun on your face. But all I can offer's the spring in my step, And the knowledge your smile makes me glad. And the tune that I raise with such fullness of heart, And hey, three out of five it ain't bad. Three out of five, three out of five, Three out of five it ain't bad (it ain't bad!) Three out of five it ain't bad, my love, Three out of five it ain't bad. *Organ grinder part in parentheses Featuring: Austin Walker, Art Martinez-Tebbel, Jack de Quidt, Janine Hawkins and Keith J Carberry Music & Description by Jack de Quidt Mall Kids is available at https://mr-matthew.itch.io/mall-kids",

      "description": "What A Big Building, I Can't See The Top By 1898, construction had begun on several boardwalk-side buildings that so exceeded the previous maximum building height that they caused a city-wide stir. Of course, early skyscrapers had been constructed before, closer to the city centre, but these new buildings' proximity to the ocean was a cause for excitement and, in some cases, concern. Would the ocean winds knock them over? Was it an act of hubris to situate such a tall building so close to the waves? These questions, however, were the purview of city folk. Those on the boardwalk were mostly disinterested by the whole situation, or irritated by the construction noise, or confused as to why the skyscrapers were called for at all. Elliott Callahan, writing in the summer of 1898, and seized with the \"skyscraper spirit\", asked a local organ grinder to \"let loose a tune commemorating the new buildings that [he] might put it to paper.\" The resulting tune did not reflect the spirit in which it was requested. Some kinds of buildings are houses. Some kinds of buildings are shops. Sometimes they even take the shops that I mentioned, And they put a little house right on the top. (Combination!) Everybody loves buildings. Everybody loves 'em tall. Everybody needs buildings, And the highest ones up are best of all. Today I will sing about the skyscraper. Today, I will sing and never stop. I'm looking over there at the great big building. And I cannot - no, I cannot - see the top.

      "description": "I Can't Find My Way Off Atlantic During the winter of 1895, the main thoroughfare of Atlantic Avenue was set upon by work crews from City Hall, who - in preparation for the approaching 20th Century - sought to improve the quality of the road surfaces and allow for increased traffic. The works were scheduled to last no longer than two months - but, thanks to mismanagement, bad luck, and direct appropriation of funds - the project stretched languorously into the summer of 1896: the year of the heatwave. \"What a disaster,\" wrote Elliott Callahan. \"The wheels of carts, of automobiles, sinking into the asphalt as it melted on the streets. Confused horses. Shouting patrons. Great columns of immobilised travellers, the length of the avenue.\" From the relative safety of the boardwalk, far from the sounds of the work crews, the organ grinders were known to sing: Oh once, long ago, I knew peace in my heart, I would rise with the sun and the birds! But now I am stuck in the back of a cart, And my anger surpasses my words. Last springtime I met a remarkable gem, In the summer, my thoughts turned romantic. I would love to revisit my sweetheart again, But I can't find my way off Atlantic. Perhaps I have been here for thirty five years. Suspended 'twixt horror and prayer. Perhaps when the horrible traffic jam clears, I will find and imprison the mayor! I will find and imprison the mayor of Bluff, Just as soon as I'm out of the fray! I can see City Hall just ahead, sure enough, But there's forty nine cars in the way. Help! Help! Help! Help! I can't find my way off Atlantic! Help! Help! Help me! Help! I can't find my way off Atlantic!

While this game of Blades in the Dark takes place in our Marielda setting, it's totally listenable even without that background (at least, that's what some totally new fans told us at the event!). That said, I do think listening to Marielda first makes it shine even brighter. For those curious, it takes place in the time jump between \"The Valentine Affair Pt. 4\" and \"Four Conversations,\" and here's how we listed it in the big list of GenCon Events: Come watch a high stakes heist in an industrial fantasy world like no other! Friends at the Table leads you through a live Blades in the Dark game featuring new and returning players from their Marielda campaign. For new fans, get ready to learn about tea witches, lovelorn gods, and a very unpredictable train. For those in the know: Months before their climactic confrontation, Aubrey and Sige find themselves teamed up with a rival gang on a robbery like no other. Their target is a national treasure: the very first words written to page. Also if you listen to this and love it, and want to hear even more about Art and Keith's characters, we recorded their character creation and posted that as Pusher update right here.

This upcoming weekend, July 3rd and July 4th, Friends at the Table will be doing a LIVE STREAM MARATHON FUNDRAISER for the National Network of Abortion Funds !! We'll be hosting the stream over at twitch.tv/friendsatthetable JOIN US 12 - 8 PM ET JULY 3RD AND JULY 4TH! Watch us play some videogames! Listen to us play some ttrpgs!!! Enjoy us not playing games at all for a bit of it!!! We might do a Marielda one shot . . . . ? It'll be fun! Tell your friends!! The Scamps Are About The unusually mild spring of 1891 saw an unusual craze sweep the length of the Bluff City boardwalks, when the organ grinders found themselves targeted by the city's children in an outbreak of particularly nefarious behavior. The children, moving in loosely organized packs, would fall upon one organ grinder after another. Some would find the cans that contained their tunes removed and dropped off the pier. Others would turn their organs' handles and salt water would pour, improbably, from the pipes. The organ grinders, by and large, were not much older than their assailants, and as mild spring turned into cold summer, unusual battle lines were drawn among Bluff City's children. Elliot Callahan, discussing this song the following year, wrote: \"I know not which young band of voices would raise these verses. Whether the beleaguered grinders - or, in parody, the roustabouts themselves - it matters not.\" The scamps are about! On the beaches and the boardwalks! The scamps are about! Send the word along the line! From the bait shop on pacific, in a mob that's quite terrific, Wearing grins that are horrific and demeanors so malign! The scamps are about! Pouring southward, ever southward, And they're carrying those sacks they use to make their wicked play! See the organ grinders panic, hear their melodies grow frantic, As the antics of the scamps intensify along their way! The scamps are about! Is there anyone to stop them? Is there any lion-hearted soul to step into the fray? If there's someone strong of spirit then I'd really like to hear it, Since the beer they poured inside my organ's getting in the way.

      "description": "Old Mister, Old Mister In 1897, the \"Twin-Pan\" barrel organ was introduced to Bluff City by the Callahan Corporation and took the boardwalk by storm. The ease of use, the smoothness of operation, and purity of tone were a significant step forward from the common \"Trout\" model used at the time. These new instruments were expensive to source, and as such, many organ grinders found themselves pushed out of business by \"Twin-Pan\" operators paid for by the boardwalk hotels. This song, first recorded by Elliott Callahan in 1899, speaks to the mingled pain and opportunity felt on the boardwalks in those days. Old Mister, Old Mister, I heard from my sister! The man on the boardwalk is closing up shop, Oh brother, our mother has heard from another, A new kind of organ has forced him to stop! The tunes that it plays are a new kind of sweetness, Old Mister, Old Mister, my spirits take flight! Old Mister, with such incomparable neatness, Its harmonies thrill and its measures delight! So brother, we're steeling our hearts for the parting, The man on the boardwalk's departure does ache, But when we attend to the new organ starting… We'll find sacrifices are easy to make!

And it would take her quarry leaving town to get her to do the same… This week on Sangfielle: Six Travelers: Pickman The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places The First Canton, aka Aldomina the Throne of Dominion: Once a fledgling human empire but nearly 1900 years ago, a minor duke of some great hell led an effort to take it over. And once they did, they pushed what was an already spreading empire even further in that direction. The Second Canton, aka The Pale Magistratum (ma-juh-strah-tuhm): The Second Canton has ordered itself around its Magistrates—holy marshals given weapons blessed by Fulmina, goddess of immediate justice, and the right to use that power as they see it. Sangfielle, the Heartland: Once, it was a breadbasket for the whole Dominion, now this is territory haunted twice: first by a bloody, buried past, and second by an uncanny, indifferent future. Concentus, the Ringed City (kun-CHEN-tus): A vast ringed city surrounding (and containing) Sangfielle. Covered in magical wards, filled with those eager to delve into the heartland or to push back its most fearsome creatures. The gaslit city of Concentus is now the most technologically advanced metropolis of the continent. Facts and Figures Maleister Price (he/him): Sherriff of Blackwick and newest member of the town council. The miners in town would all tell you that Price is the best of them and always has been, but you're not quite sure that you remember that about him. Alekest san Geraint, the Margrave of Tescano, the Porcelain Knight (he/him): If you're a long time reader of this publication, Alekest needs no introduction. You know him from his past adventures, like the slaying of the UnSevered Beast or his solitary stand at Cedartree Station. Maybe you forget some of the details, his angst-filled childhood, the fraught years after his mother's death, his uncanny dreams. Somehow, someway, he has become fast friends with the Shape Knight Pickman. The Visitor: According to the Wrights, a figure came to them from Zevunzolia and opened their eyes to the truth above it all. Organizations Aldomina (al-doh-mee-nah): What once stood as the name of the whole continent is now only the name of the Confederation that runs across the eastern half of the territory surrounding the Sangfielle, currently constituted by three sub-states called Cantons. The Shape Knights : It took people with clear minds, great ingenuity, and implacable spirit to face down and defeat one of the living trains of Sangfielle. In the time since, they've crafted armor from their slain foe, and with that have come to be experts of all things train. They herd, they breach, they redirect. But they haven't yet killed a second. Wrights of the Seventh Sun: A secret society dedicated to the construction of Zevunzolia, whatever the cost. Their motivations are many: Some believe that the Devils ought to have continued climbing whent hey escaped hell, that this was not the paradise earned. Otherse believe that Zevunzolia is telos of telos, the end-cause of all end-causes, and thus will inevitably bring itself into being. And given that, to do anything but aid it is to risk exclusion from it, or worse.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for organs, mass destruction, blood, general and surgical body horror, and bodily transformation. When the mysterious and genteel Dyre Ode made Es the offer, it was one of the rare moments of doubt for the ancient and powerful figure. Would they accept the invitation? Could she assist them when the moment of truth came? One thing that Dyre was certain of, though, was that if they were successful, Es was uniquely suited for what would come next.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for insect infestation, spiders, bodily transformation, gun violence, threat of dissection/forced medical inspection, death. It has been a long journey for Duvall. He first came to the heartland from Aldomina years ago, in search of adventure and glory. But he found only questions of the most existential sort, and a city that would reshape him utterly. Now, years later, he upholds a promise he made to his cousin and journeys home. This week on Sangfielle: Six Travelers: Duvall The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places The Sleeping City: Every 13 years, a metropolis wakes with the buzzing sound of life. Do not cross its borders uninvited, especially not when it and its inhabitants are at rest. Upon visiting the City, Blackwick County: From the mines to the lake, the hills to the flats, the town once called Eastern Folly has felt a little more expansive now that it's out of the hard grip of the old curse. It's people aren't perfect, but they've made it through some dark times, and that's more than most can say. The First Canton, aka Aldomina the Throne of Dominion: Once a fledgling human empire but nearly 1900 years ago, a minor duke of some great hell led an effort to take it over. And once they did, they pushed what was an already spreading empire even further in that direction.

Covered in magical wards, filled with those eager to delve into the heartland or to push back its most fearsome creatures. The gaslit city of Concentus is now the most technologically advanced metropolis of the continent. Facts and Figures The Red Zephyr: A train what takes on strange character under the moonlight. For a month, it's torn into not only Bell Metal Station, but also any passing train it could reach. But when the Blackwick Group investigated it, they found that the Zephyr was in fact the Shape Knight Fezh, transformed into this new horror by the person they trusted most of all. The Course: There is debate about the true nature of the Heartland's Truth, the power that turned Sangfielle into what it is today. But the Cleavers call it the Course. Part river, part lesson, part direction traveled. Entirely beyond the grasp of mortal minds. Organizations Cleavers: Given how loose and fluid this collection of monster hunters, mystery solvers, and naturalists is, it's hard to call them \"an organization.\" But when the central belief system of a group is that everything is ever in flux, well, give them the credit of applying that particular ontology to themselves: Whether left to their own devices or joined to a commune of other cleavers, on a long enough timeline, they all become tremendous, monstrous angels.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for human sacrifice, knives, explosions, memory loss, death. When Hazard entered our story, they may have seemed like someone defined by what was missing. But in truth, they had something that the members of the Blackwick Group never did: A clear and obvious objective. Now, standing on the other side of vengeance, they have the freedom (and the burden) of deciding what comes next. This week on Sangfielle: Six Travelers: Hazard The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Zevunzolia: Who the hell knows. A miraculous city waiting to be built? A utopian dimension adjacent our own? \"The Seventh Sun Itself,\" I think I heard one of those fools call it. All I know is, however prime and pristine it is in promise, the pricetag keeps going conveniently unmentioned... Facts and Figures The Sunken Empress Altapasqua (she/her): Around fifty years after the panic set in, Altapasqua told her people she would ride across this cursed land and purge it of its disease and danger. She only made it about three fourths of the way. And well, it's as expected. She was down there ever since. Gandy Dancers: The strange little creatures that maintain the trains. The Knights of Virtue, fka The Toll Collectors: It is fair to say that this group is still made up of the devil Agdeline (she/her), drakkan Ettel (he/him), and human Larch (he/him), but it isn't right to simply call them a \"trio\" anymore. The former miners-turned-bandits-turned-thieves-turned-bodyguards have come into the employ of Queen Virtue, and have revealed their true nature: Once per month, three more of them appear from the depths of the Blackwick Mines, and soon join with the others in search of and profit and adventure. Emma Serchilde (she/her) : Once, Emma was known in Sapodilla as one of the most successful investigators of the Glim Macula. A brutal interrogator and competent captain, Emma was nevertheless more loyal to herself than to the Macula. When Virtue became the city's new queen, Emma was quick to sell out her allies and devote herself to the city's newest power. Calen fel Dynestia (he/him): Heir to a grim line, Calen has joined the Shape Knights in an effort to rehabilitate the fel Dynestia name. Eyes sunken, pasty purple face covered with stubble, and all the highest fashion of Sapodilla circa twenty years ago. Betrayed his lover, Fezh, Fezh (they/them): Soft for a Shape Knight. Strong for a Shape Knight. The closest there was to everyone in Bell Metal, but Calen most of all. Now lives as the furious engine, Red Zephyr . Uno Riscano (he/him): The so-called \"Count of Cards,\" this devil was the leader of one of the \"six suits\" that make up the Wrights of the Seventh Sun. Now headless. Organizations Glim Macula: Until earlier this year, Sapodilla was marked by its white coated witch hunters, who terrorized the city's margins and invented new boogeymen when they could not find the ones they were certain to live in the shadows. Under Queen Virtue, they've been scattered to the wind. The Caravan of the Coin: Cursed by Ribbadon, Frog God of Wealth, these traveling merchant-clerics never arrive at a destination carrying what they expect. Wrights of the Seventh Sun: A secret society dedicated to the construction of Zevunzolia, whatever the cost. Their motivations are many: Some believe that the Devils ought to have continued climbing whent hey escaped hell, that this was not the paradise earned. Others believe that Zevunzolia is telos of telos, the end-cause of all end-causes, and thus will inevitably bring itself into being. And given that, to do anything but aid it is to risk exclusion from it, or worse.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for blood, memory loss, illusory reality, discussion of possible hallucination. You might wonder where the rest of the erstwhile Blackwick Group might be headed after their fracture in Blackwick. But deep down inside, you probably know exactly where Lye Lychen is headed, don't you? That man has unfinished business, and he is nothing if not someone committed to getting straight to the task at hand. This week on Sangfielle: Six Travelers: Lyke The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Blackwick County: From the mines to the lake, the hills to the flats, the town once called Eastern Folly has felt a little more expansive now that it's out of the hard grip of the old curse. It's people aren't perfect, but they've made it through some dark times, and that's more than most can say. Sapodilla: One of, if not the, largest city inside of the walls of Concentus. Sapodilla rests on the western shore of the vast lake that takes up much of southeastern Sangfielle. Not too much is known about how things are inside of its gates since Queen Virtue rolled into town. Marrowcreek: Quite a ways west of Blackwick, the maps say there is a town called Marrowcreek. Never been myself, but I've heard about it (often in the sort of hypotheticals people pose to you to \"make conversations\" at parties.) Lye Lychen, Chine, and Hazard visited it (or a Course-built facsimile) a few months back, when they hopped off the Jade Moon. Bluerock Quarry: Bluestone is what you might guess from the name, a quarry for digging up stones of various qualities and makes, but all of which is blue in nature. While slate and limestone and granite all serve their ends, the real find is welkin, a stone as light as air but tough as the hardest metal. Now who could be on the lookout for something like that? Unschola Republica, formerly the Third Canton (oon-skoh-la): For a millenia, the alchemists, mage-practitioners, and cryptotheological scholars of the Third Canton complained in secret about the leash kept on them by Aldomina's distant leaders. They've since slipped that leash, and whether that's for better or worse, time will tell. Sangfielle, the Heartland: Once, it was a breadbasket for the whole Dominion, now this is territory haunted twice: first by a bloody, buried past, and second by an uncanny, indifferent future. Facts and Figures Fendleton the Lake Skeletons: A boisterous skeleton that Lyke once met on the way to Last Rest (and Bell Metal Station beyond that). Loyal to Altapasqua? Or… loyal to unloyalty? Hard to pin down. Dayward yon Vantzon-Estonbergh aka Dayward YVE (he/him): The moneyed scion of a minor Aldominan dynasty, Dayward YVE has traveled to the Heartland as both eager-apologist and curious explorer. Sensing opportunity, he settled in Blackwick County and has used it as a staging ground for an ever-growing industrial empire. Uno Riscano (he/him): The so-called \"Count of Cards,\" this devil was the leader of one of the \"six suits\" that make up the Wrights of the Seventh Sun. Now headless. Aterika'Kaal (it/its): An ambivalent and ancient spirit. Offers the sweet smell and sublime beauty of roses and the sturdy foundation of a root structure. In exchange: Feed it. Karston Leberge (he/him): Sergeant of Bread inside of the Wrights of the Seventh Sun, Karston runs operations at the Bluerock Quarry. Alaway (currently he/him, varies historically): Was last seen as the waxy, vampiric minister of Yellowfield named Regan, whose generations-long study of technology led him to dream of (and work towards creating) \"The City of Lights,\" a place of flameless fire, energetic implements, and the safety and freedom to live as one wants. Now, having somehow returned to the form that the Blackwick Group first met him as, he threatens to steal the very lifeblood of Blackwick itself. Organizations The Boundless Conclave: Less of an individual church, more of an association between hundreds of independent faiths. Small sects, nearly forgotten cults, and unjealous gods make up this vast pantheon. Wrights of the Seventh Sun: A secret society dedicated to the construction of Zevunzolia, whatever the cost. Their motivations are many: Some believe that the Devils ought to have continued climbing whent hey escaped hell, that this was not the paradise earned. Otherse believe that Zevunzolia is telos of telos, the end-cause of all end-causes, and thus will inevitably bring itself into being. And given that, to do anything but aid it is to risk exclusion from it, or worse.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for blood, illusory reality, discussion of possible hallucination. We're nearly at the end now, but there is nevertheless some way to go still. Six ways, in fact. First: the Keen Marn Ancura heads north along with the shape knight Bucho and a number of refugees who have finally, truly had enough of Blackwick and its curses. This week on Sangfielle: Six Travelers: Marn The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Blackwick County: From the mines to the lake, the hills to the flats, the town once called Eastern Folly has felt a little more expansive now that it's out of the hard grip of the old curse.

It bothers me little, how you spell that name.\" Ana Berylia (she/her): Dayward YVE's maid, a somewhat overwhelmed Carpana who has not adjusted to life in the Heartland. Her body is covered in brown/black hair with little streaks of grey at her temples. Mostly seen in uniform, a grey dress with white apron. Mr. Kenson (he/him): Big Horn Ram Kaprak. White fur with brown and black spots. Personal valet. Copper wireframe glasses. Proper black suit. Organizations The Telluricist Union: Made up by a mix of peoples driven to the hills by Aldomina, this group of knife sharpeners, herbalists, geologists, and all around investigators have made it their job to keep their old wisdom and see it used to help those in need. The best among them are called Keen. Sisters of the Mother-Beast: A dedicated priory of worshippers, living in an eternal hymn, worshiping a god long dead. The Shape Knights: It took people with clear minds, great ingenuity, and implacable spirit to face down and defeat one of the living trains of Sangfielle. In the time since, they've crafted armor from their slain foe, and with that have come to be experts of all things train. They herd, they breach, they redirect. But they haven't yet killed a second. The Carnival of Moted Light: It announces itself with wind and furious sound, an invitation to partake in joys and curiosities. You may not leave. Not yet. Not until it's over. Unless, of course, you'd like to stay forever. Wrights of the Seventh Sun: A secret society dedicated to the construction of Zevunzolia, whatever the cost. Their motivations are many: Some believe that the Devils ought to have continued climbing whent hey escaped hell, that this was not the paradise earned.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for decapitation, magical compulsion, weaponized false memories, major character death, corpse, flesh eating creature, mass destruction, premeditated act of violence, burning, murder, bodily transformation, general body horror. With their contract over and their interests split, the Blackwick Group's time together seems to be coming to a swift and sudden end. And that's just the half of it. The Carnival of Moted Light reaches in to the county, sloughing it away. Now, the night is all dust and creaking. In their final hours, what new sights, sounds, and flavors might the Blackwick Group add to it? This week on Sangfielle: Dead in the Dust Pt. 3 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Blackwick County: From the mines to the lake, the hills to the flats, the town once called Eastern Folly has felt a little more expansive now that it's out of the hard grip of the old curse. It's people aren't perfect, but they've made it through some dark times, and that's more than most can say. Sapodilla: One of, if not the, largest city inside of the walls of Concentus. Sapodilla rests on the western shore of the vast lake that takes up much of southeastern Sangfielle. Not too much is known about how things are inside of its gates since Queen Virtue rolled into town. The First Canton, aka Aldomina the Throne of Dominion: Once a fledgling human empire but nearly 1900 years ago, a minor duke of some great hell led an effort to take it over. And once they did, they pushed what was an already spreading empire even further in that direction. The Second Canton, aka The Pale Magistratum (ma-juh-strah-tuhm): The Second Canton has ordered itself around its Magistrates—holy marshals given weapons blessed by Fulmina, goddess of immediate justice, and the right to use that power as they see it. Unschola Republica, formerly the Third Canton (oon-skoh-la): For a millenia, the alchemists, mage-practitioners, and cryptotheological scholars of the Third Canton complained in secret about the leash kept on them by Aldomina's distant leaders. They've since slipped that leash, and whether that's for better or worse, time will tell. Free Seas of Kay'va, formerly the Fourth Canton (kai-vah): First established after Cecile Cartine's revolution over 300 years ago, today Kay'va is home to a collection of aligned communes who swear that the only way to prosperity is through the defense of equality. The Fifth Canton, the Protectorate Kingdom of Ojantan (oh-JAHN-tahn): Ojantan was once a kingdom to rival Aldomina, and a solid place to live to boot, if a little over-structured for my taste. But the Devils got to the nation's leaders, and now it's been reduced to another Canton in the Empress' collection. Sangfielle, the Heartland: Once, it was a breadbasket for the whole Dominion, now this is territory haunted twice: first by a bloody, buried past, and second by an uncanny, indifferent future. Concentus, the Ringed City (kun-CHEN-tus): A vast ringed city surrounding (and containing) Sangfielle. Covered in magical wards, filled with those eager to delve into the heartland or to push back its most fearsome creatures. The gaslit city of Concentus is now the most technologically advanced metropolis of the continent. The Residuum: A realm of vibrant color, where the things of the world go when their time in the material world fades away. A plane of death, but rendered in glorious light. Facts and Figures Dayward yon Vantzon-Estonbergh aka Dayward YVE (he/him): The moneyed scion of a minor Aldominan dynasty, Dayward YVE has traveled to the Heartland as both eager-apologist and curious explorer. Sensing opportunity, he settled in Blackwick County and has used it as a staging ground for an ever-growing industrial empire. Maleister Price (he/him): Sherriff of Blackwick and newest member of the town council. The miners in town would all tell you that Price is the best of them and always has been, but you're not quite sure that you remember that about him. Uno Riscano (he/him): The so-called \"Count of Cards,\" this devil is the leader of one of the \"six suits\" that make up the Wrights of the Seventh Sun. Target of Hazard's ire due to an ill-handed card game. Proctor Ekashi Wolff (he/him): Once, the good proctor helped lead the services of the Triadic Pyre in Blackwick, and spend what free time he had working with the township's council. It was that same interest in community and service which led him to stand up for his people when the Pale Magistrates blew into town. Unfortunately for Mr. Wolff, good character is not bulletproof. The Knights of Virtue, fka The Toll Collectors: It is fair to say that thisg roup is still made up of the devil Agdeline (she/her), drakkan Ettel (he/him), and human Larch (he/him), but it isn't right to simply call them a \"trio\" anymore. The former miners-turned-bandits-turned-thieves-turned-bodyguards have come into the employ of Queen Virtue, and have revealed their true nature: Once per month, three more of them appear from the depths of the Blackwick Mines, and soon join with the others in search of and profit and adventure. Dyre Ode (he/they): When an agent of the almanac pressed this mysterious, masked figure for more information about him, they only repeated their name, as if to ensure we'd print it right, adding \"Dyre with Y but Ode as you'd like, a poem said in praise or a debt gone unpaid. It bothers me little, how you spell that name.\" Stanislaka (she/they): Blackwick's attendent of the Boundless Conclave temple, an young ojantani whose faith to Slumbous knows no bounds. A member of the town council. Ana Berylia (she/her): Dayward YVE's maid, a somewhat overwhelmed Carpana who has not adjusted to life in the Heartland. Her body is covered in brown/black hair with little streaks of grey at her temples. Mostly seen in uniform, a grey dress with white apron. Mr. Kenson (he/him): Big Horn Ram Kaprak. White fur with brown and black spots. Personal valet. Copper wireframe glasses. Proper black suit. Chantilly Scathe (she/her): The signs and barkers rarely say her name alone. She ain't Chantilly, or even Ms. Scathe, she's always \"Ms. Chantilly Scathe and Her Shackled Engine.\" Don't let her showmanship and ringmaster garb fool you though: She seems to have done what no Shape Knight could: Make a train of the Shape, The Grand Cormorant Limited, her very own pet. Dr. Kerr Kern (she/her): A Telluricist on loan to the Magistrates, where she works on final preparations for her Keen exam. While she's grown close to the group over the last year, their methods do trouble her. Currently holding Marn's research on Zevunzolia, nullstuff, the Wrights of the Seventh Sun, and the fundamental nature of curses. Aterika'Kaal (it/its): An ambivalent and ancient spirit. Offers the sweet smell and sublime beauty of roses and the sturdy foundation of a root structure. In exchange: Feed it. Alaway (currently he/him, varies historically): Was last seen as the waxy, vampiric minister of Yellowfield named Regan, whose generations-long study of technology led him to dream of (and work towards creating) \"The City of Lights,\" a place of flameless fire, energetic implements, and the safety and freedom to live as one wants. Now, having somehow returned to the form that the Blackwick Group first met him as, he threatens to steal the very lifeblood of Blackwick itself. The Course: There is debate about the true nature of the Heartland's Truth, the power that turned Sangfielle into what it is today. But the Cleavers call it the Course. Part river, part lesson, part direction traveled. Entirely beyond the grasp of mortal minds. Organizations Aldomina (al-doh-mee-nah): What once stood as the name of the whole continent is now only the name of the Confederation that runs across the eastern half of the territory surrounding the Sangfielle, currently constituted by three sub-states called Cantons. The Carnival of Moted Light: It announces itself with wind and furious sound, an invitation to partake in joys and curiosities. You may not leave. Not yet. Not until it's over. Unless, of course, you'd like to stay forever. The Boundless Conclave: Less of an individual church, more of an association between hundreds of independent faiths. Small sects, nearly forgotten cults, and unjealous gods make up this vast pantheon. The Caravan of the Coin: Cursed by Ribbadon, Frog God of Wealth, these traveling merchant-clerics never arrive at a destination carrying what they expect. Wrights of the Seventh Sun: A secret society dedicated to the construction of Zevunzolia, whatever the cost. Their motivations are many: Some believe that the Devils ought to have continued climbing whent hey escaped hell, that this was not the paradise earned. Otherse believe that Zevunzolia is telos of telos, the end-cause of all end-causes, and thus will inevitably bring itself into being. And given that, to do anything but aid it is to risk exclusion from it, or worse.

It would be too simple for the Blackwick Group to have the space and time necessary to work through everything that has happened to them recently. It has been only hours since rescuing Marn, Pickman, and Bucho from Alaway (and fewer still since Lye Lychen handed over more power to the nascent deity), and yet a new threat curls its way around Blackwick.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for cannibalism, blood, direct physical trauma to a bodily organ, burned hands, implied temporary imprisonment, and rotten food. Having escaped Alaway's ad hoc temple, the Blackwick Group has attended to their collective wounds and begun to piece together what the vampiric Lord of Wax is planning. In short: godhood. In detail: the theft and usurpation of the last, material power of the Mother-Beast, the god who once called this territory hers. They know, too, that to confront their foe directly at this point would be to invite destruction and calamity. And so it is time for counter-schemes and further research. Perhaps, though... perhaps just a peek? A quick look at what this recurring enemy is capable of. Just a glance, and nothing more. This week on Sangfielle: Wax, Inchor, and Iron Pt. 4 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Blackwick County: From the mines to the lake, the hills to the flats, the town once called Eastern Folly has felt a little more expansive now that it's out of the hard grip of the old curse. It's people aren't perfect, but they've made it through some dark times, and that's more than most can say. Zevunzolia: Who the hell knows. A miraculous city waiting to be built? A utopian dimension adjacent our own? \"The Seventh Sun Itself,\" I think I heard one of those fools call it. All I know is, however prime and pristine it is in promise, the pricetag keeps going conveniently unmentioned... The Second Canton, aka The Pale Magistratum : The Second Canton has ordered itself around its Magistrates—holy marshals given weapons blessed by Fulmina, goddess of immediate justice, and the right to use that power as they see it. Free Seas of Kay'va, formerly the Fourth Canton : First established after Cecile Cartine's revolution over 300 years ago, today Kay'va is home to a collection of aligned communes who swear that the only way to prosperity is through the defense of equality. Facts and Figures Proctor Ekashi Wolff (he/him): Once, the good proctor helped lead the services of the Triadic Pyre in Blackwick, and spend what free time he had working with the township's council. It was that same interest in community and service which led him to stand up for his people when the Pale Magistrates blew into town. Unfortunately for Mr. Wolff, good character is not bulletproof. Sister Marisha (she/her): For decades, the human called Marisha served as the representative of the Boundless Conclave in Eastern Follow and as the only apparent follower of the old Cult of the Mother-Beast. Eager to guide, and quick to reprimand, she gained a reputation as a well meaning hard ass in the mining town. Now she finds herself adjusting to life inside this secret priory of salt, ash, and ceramic.

Now, having somehow returned to the form that the Blackwick Group first met him as, he threatens to steal the very lifeblood of Blackwick itself. The Course: There is debate about the true nature of the Heartland's Truth, the power that turned Sangfielle into what it is today . But the Cleavers call it the Course.

In the night since the confrontation at the (now ruined) train station, the waxen thralls of the vampire Alaway have spread through the streets of the low town. Above, meanwhile, the deputies left behind by the Second Canton's invaders itch for a fight.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for description of people bound and gagged, doppelgangers, mention of major bodily transformation, and decapitation. With the Ravening Beast dealt with—at least for now—Lye Lychen, Hazard, and the Cleaver Chine continue to track their way towards the nearest settlement. There, they hope to find supplies, a good night of sleep, and a quick passage northward to Blackwich (which is in sore need of their skills and support at the moment). But before they reach the quarry in the distance, they come across a too-familiar trio with a problem of their own. This week on Sangfielle: Two Kinds of Quarry Pt. 2 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places The Residuum: A realm of vibrant color, where the things of the world go when their time in the material world fades away. A plane of death, but rendered in glorious light. Bluerock Quarry: Bluestone is what you might guess from the name, a quarry for digging up stones of various qualities and makes, but all of which is blue in nature. While slate and limestone and granite all serve their ends, the real find is welkin, a stone as light as air but tough as the hardest metal. Now who could be on the lookout for something like that? Facts and Figures The Course: There is debate about the true nature of the Heartland's Truth, the power that turned Sangfielle into what it is today . But the Cleavers call it the Course. Part river, part lesson, part direction traveled. Entirely beyond the grasp of mortal minds. Uno Riscano (he/him) : The so-called \"Count of Cards,\" this devil is the leader of one of the \"six suits\" that make up the Wrights of the Seventh Sun. Target of Hazard's ire due to an ill-handed card game. Aterika'Kaal (it/its) : An ambivalent and ancient spirit. Offers the sweet smell and sublime beauty of roses and the sturdy foundation of a root structure. In exchange: Feed it. The Ravening Beast (it/its) : A howl in the mind of Lye Lyken. A beast on the hunt. It haunts through the course of time, the shape of mind. An echo of a possible future? Chantilly Scathe (she/her): The signs and barkers rarely say her name alone. She ain't Chantilly, or even Ms. Scathe, she's always \"Ms. Chantilly Scathe and Her Shackled Engine.\" Don't let her showmanship and ringmaster garb fool you though: She seems to have done what no Shape Knight could: Make a train of the Shape, The Grand Cormorant Limited, her very own pet. Organizations The Caravan of the Coin: Cursed by Ribbadon, Frog God of Wealth, these traveling merchant-clerics never arrive at a destination carrying what they expect. Wrights of the Seventh Sun: A secret society dedicated to the construction of Zevunzolia, whatever the cost. Their motivations are many: Some believe that the Devils ought to have continued climbing whent hey escaped hell, that this was not the paradise earned. Otherse believe that Zevunzolia is telos of telos, the end-cause of all end-causes, and thus will inevitably bring itself into being. And given that, to do anything but aid it is to risk exclusion from it, or worse. The Toll Collectors: Made up of the devil Agdeline (she/her), drakkan Ettel (he/him), and human Larch (he/him), this trio once spent time mining in the hills of Blackwick. Recently, they've been spotted as bandits, hired thieves, and paid escorts—sometimes (strangely) holding down multiple jobs in multiple places at the same time. In any case, rumor has it that they fly a new banner now… The Bell Metal Band: Once, the Bell Metal Band used their base of operations to capture Shape parts for study and re-use. But a tragic betrayal has sent them spiraling in unexpected ways. Now, a new structure rises atop their home...

With a few days of overland travel behind them, the trio of Hazard, Lye Lychen, and the Cleaver Chine near the first landmark on their long journey west and north back towards Blackwick. From a high hill, they spot some smoke and light in the distance, and make their way towards the first landmark on their journey home. But before they get near, they first come face to face with a choice and a familiar threat.

A plane of death, but rendered in glorious light.

Now I know it's passé to talk about how people may be the real monsters , but look at this situation the Blackwick Group have found themselves in. Sure, they've found themselves across from an ever-expanding waxen beast. And yes, the township has been overrun by a rambling sort of candle zombie. And neither of those things are good. But when push comes to shove, what's the thing that's making this so complicated? Well, it's the magistrates ain't it? By laying siege to the town, they primed the city for chaos, readied it to go up in flames, burst, and boil. And now the Blackwick Group's gotta bring things back to a simmer. Only problem is, they're just people too...

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for insect infestation of a human body, death, hanging corpses/gallows. The season has turned in the time since the Blackwick Group last stepped foot in the nominal hometown. The heat fades; the brisk air of heartland winter sweeps in, and with it: visitors. A cousin come to retrieve her kin. A fellow student of the path, at crossed ends. And, of course, the yet unreckoned with consequences of action long past. This week on Sangfielle: Just Returns Pt. 2 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Sapodilla : One of, if not the, largest city inside of the walls of Concentus. Sapodilla rests on the western shore of the vast lake that takes up much of southeastern Sangfielle, and prizes itself as the rare hub of culture in the bloodfields. In recent years, the powerful witch hunting organization called the Glim Macula has grown in power there, owing to the city's focus on furthering \"civilization.\" The Sleeping City: Every 13 years, a metropolis wakes with the buzzing sound of life. Do not cross its borders uninvited, especially not when it and its inhabitants are at rest. Blackwick County: From the mines to the lake, the hills to the flats, the town once called Eastern Folly has felt a little more expansive now that it's out of the hard grip of the old curse. It's people aren't perfect, but they've made it through some dark times, and that's more than most can say. Zevunzolia: Who the hell knows. A miraculous city waiting to be built? A utopian dimension adjacent our own? \"The Seventh Sun Itself,\" I think I heard one of those fools call it. All I know is, however prime and pristine it is in promise, the pricetag keeps going conveniently unmentioned... Facts and Figures Alekest san Geraint, the Margrave of Tescano, the Porcelain Knight (he/him): If you're a long time reader of this publication, Alekest needs no introduction. You know him from his past adventures, like the slaying of the UnSevered Beast or his solitary stand at Cedartree Station. Maybe you forget some of the details, his angst-filled childhood, the fraught years after his mother's death, his uncanny dreams. Well, Knight Pickman seems not to be a reader, if her confusion at the Margrave's arrival is any indication. Felix Hollowfield (he/him): Once, Hollowfield was the genius behind the Glim Macula's technological supremacy in Sapodilla. A single push, though, and he's little more than a memory. Aterika'Kaal (it/its) : An ambivalent and ancient spirit. Offers the sweet smell and sublime beauty of roses and the sturdy foundation of a root structure. In exchange: Feed it. Alaway (varies) : Last seen as the waxy, vampiric minister of Yellowfield, Regan, whose generations-long study of technology led him to dream of (and work towards creating) \"The City of Lights,\" a place of flameless fire, energetic implements, and the safety and freedom to live as one wants. Disposed of, for now at least. But the dream yet lives. The Ojan: To call it \"The Ojan River\" is not only to misspeak but to advertise your distance from knowledge. Ojan itself means \"running water,\" and in Ojantani it is the word you attach to other words to mark them as rivers--each just an faint echo of this paragon of waterways. The Jade Moon: A luxurious vessel, the Jade Moon glides up and down the Ojan. You have to work to find its exterior wooden hull, so covered is it in silken, green banners and curtains. Dining, Dancing, Gambling, Live Music, plush living. An engine that churns below. 250 feet long, 50 feet wide. It's a beast, but in the width of the Ojan--in some places over 2 miles wide--it pales. Teak: First mate of the Jade Moon. The Course: There is debate about the true nature of the Heartland's Truth, the power that turned Sangfielle into what it is today . But the Cleavers call it the Course. Part river, part lesson, part direction traveled. Entirely beyond the grasp of mortal minds. The Structure: Reason, logic, sense.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for insect infestation of a human body, bodily transformation, and visual delusions. With the ersatz town of Marrow Creek behind them, the members of the Blackwick Group still onboard the Jade Moon find themselves consumed with personal projects, personal schemes, and personal excess. Marn finds herself between raw nothing and a place with the vibrant air of everything all at once . Es investigates the limits of \"room service.\" Pickman sturdies herself for a troubling conversation. Duvall, as he is wont to do, continues to investigates the ever-changing self. And there is, of course, the matter of a card tournament. This week on Sangfielle: Just Returns Pt. 1 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Sapodilla : One of, if not the, largest city inside of the walls of Concentus. Sapodilla rests on the western shore of the vast lake that takes up much of southeastern Sangfielle, and prizes itself as the rare hub of culture in the bloodfields. In recent years, the powerful witch hunting organization called the Glim Macula has grown in power there, owing to the city's focus on furthering \"civilization.\" The Sleeping City: Every 13 years, a metropolis wakes with the buzzing sound of life. Do not cross its borders uninvited, especially not when it and its inhabitants are at rest. Blackwick County: From the mines to the lake, the hills to the flats, the town once called Eastern Folly has felt a little more expansive now that it's out of the hard grip of the old curse. It's people aren't perfect, but they've made it through some dark times, and that's more than most can say. Zevunzolia: Who the hell knows. A miraculous city waiting to be built? A utopian dimension adjacent our own? \"The Seventh Sun Itself,\" I think I heard one of those fools call it. All I know is, however prime and pristine it is in promise, the pricetag keeps going conveniently unmentioned... Facts and Figures Alekest san Geraint, the Margrave of Tescano, the Porcelain Knight (he/him): If you're a long time reader of this publication, Alekest needs no introduction. You know him from his past adventures, like the slaying of the UnSevered Beast or his solitary stand at Cedartree Station. Maybe you forget some of the details, his angst-filled childhood, the fraught years after his mother's death, his uncanny dreams. Well, Knight Pickman seems not to be a reader, if her confusion at the Margrave's arrival is any indication. Felix Hollowfield (he/him) : Once, Hollowfield was the genius behind the Glim Macula's technological supremacy in Sapodilla. A single push, though, and he's little more than a memory. Aterika'Kaal (it/its) : An ambivalent and ancient spirit. Offers the sweet smell and sublime beauty of roses and the sturdy foundation of a root structure. In exchange: Feed it. Alaway (varies) : Last seen as the waxy, vampiric minister of Yellowfield, Regan, whose generations-long study of technology led him to dream of (and work towards creating) \"The City of Lights,\" a place of flameless fire, energetic implements, and the safety and freedom to live as one wants. Disposed of, for now at least. But the dream yet lives. The Ojan: To call it \"The Ojan River\" is not only to misspeak but to advertise your distance from knowledge. Ojan itself means \"running water,\" and in Ojantani it is the word you attach to other words to mark them as rivers--each just an faint echo of this paragon of waterways. The Jade Moon: A luxurious vessel, the Jade Moon glides up and down the Ojan. You have to work to find its exterior wooden hull, so covered is it in silken, green banners and curtains. Dining, Dancing, Gambling, Live Music, plush living. An engine that churns below. 250 feet long, 50 feet wide. It's a beast, but in the width of the Ojan--in some places over 2 miles wide--it pales. Teak: First mate of the Jade Moon. The Course: There is debate about the true nature of the Heartland's Truth, the power that turned Sangfielle into what it is today . But the Cleavers call it the Course. Part river, part lesson, part direction traveled. Entirely beyond the grasp of mortal minds. The Structure: Reason, logic, sense. The world is, fundamentally, a place that fits together and functions. We may not like that, say the adherents of the structure. And sometimes, the world may move in ways beyond our particular ken. But there is something holding it together, and that, they say, is the Heartland's Truth: The Structure.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for disorientation, hallucinations/distortions of reality, death, humanoid corpses, knives, stabbing, blood, and the mention of animal death/slaughterhouses. Hazard, Lye Lychen, and the cleaver Chine arrived to Marrowcreek together, but now they find themselves separated and spread to the extremities of the mysterious town. To the north, the card dealer and erstwhile caravaneer finds herself face to face with their quarry in the most unlikely of places. To the south, the junk mage confronts questions he'd thus far denied he was interested in. And to the east, the hunter sees a reflection of themself and is pulled ever closer towards it. This week on Sangfielle: Marrow in the Bone The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Marrowcreek: Quite a ways west of Blackwick, the maps say there is a town called Marrowcreek. Never been myself, but I've heard about it (often in the sort of hypotheticals people pose to you to \"make conversations\" at parties.) Unschola Republica, formerly the Third Canton (oon-skoh-la): For a millenia, the alchemists, mage-practitioners, and cryptotheological scholars of the Third Canton complained in secret about the leash kept on them by Aldomina's distant leaders. They've since slipped that leash, and whether that's for better or worse, time will tell. Blackwick County: From the mines to the lake, the hills to the flats, the town once called Eastern Folly has felt a little more expansive now that it's out of the hard grip of the old curse. It's people aren't perfect, but they've made it through some dark times, and that's more than most can say. Zevunzolia: Who the hell knows. A miraculous city waiting to be built? A utopian dimension adjacent our own? \"The Seventh Sun Itself,\" I think I heard one of those fools call it. All I know is, however prime and pristine it is in promise, the pricetag keeps going conveniently unmentioned... Facts and Figures Doctor Yersa Mallow (she/her): According to at least some of the locals, Marrowreek is named for Mallow, who led a group of the ill here to perform the sort of medicine that even the Unschola Republica forbids. Personally, I just don't think it adds up. Katonya (she/her): A cleaver near the end of her career, Katonya's body bears all the marks of years in service to the Heartland. Loyal to those who employ her, and a walking catastrophe to those she opposes. Reuben (he/him): A kind and hard-working fisherman who's lived in Marrowcreek for a while now, per his own telling. Uno Riscano (he/him): 🂿 Zofina (she/her): An apothecary and witch in Marrowcreek, whose shop you might confuse for a house if you paid it no second glance. Delian (he/him): A new arrival to Marrowcreek and its slaughterhouse. Staying at the midtown Hotel. Erlin, the Tactful God of Lakes (he/him): People don't often think of \"lakeness,\" and that's because Erlin does the thinking for you. He embodies the relaxing, if humid, depths of Sangfielle's many lakes. His temple is in the southwestern quadrant of the heartland. The Ojan: To call it \"The Ojan River\" is not only to misspeak but to advertise your distance from knowledge. Ojan itself means \"running water,\" and in Ojantani it is the word you attach to other words to mark them as rivers--each just an faint echo of this paragon of waterways.

The w ord went out to every worker on board the Jade Moon, and was passed to any passengers moving about the cabins: Stay inside. This was not the normal call to remain indoors during the ninth through eleventh days of the journey northward up the Ojan. No, this was something special. After all, as far as the captain and crew could tell, they weren't even on the Ojan anymore. This was somewhere else. This was Marrowcreek. This week on Sangfielle: Marrow in the Field The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Marrowcreek: Quite a ways west of Blackwick, the maps say there is a town called Marrowcreek.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for insect infestation, detailed description of insect infestation of an enclosed space, detailed description of insects on skin. A day in the market can be a joy for even those who do not aim to barter. The sights and sounds, the smells, the tastes! A reprieve from travel, even if just from travel through life. But also, it is a way to see the passions of others made material, and of course an opportunity for chance encounters to reshape one's day, week, even life. What wonders will the oldest marketplace in Sangfielle, the wallside town of Cantbank, offer the Blackwick group? And where will they go next. This week on Sangfielle: Passage on the Jade Moon Pt. 3 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Cantbank: A long time ago, the story goes, Aldnomina set its sights on the heartland. Conquest, colonization, and consolidation. Well, turns out that the Heartland has many a mighty thing inside of it. And one such thing had many a favorite place. And it set out, so it is said, to visit each of them until Aldomina came. And as was its way, whichever it was at when Aldomina finally reached the gates, that place would be hidden from the eyes of the invaders. And so it is, by the blessing of its patron, that Cantbank, a market town built into the walls and caves of an old clifface, went untouched. Sapodilla : One of, if not the, largest city inside of the walls of Concentus. Sapodilla rests on the western shore of the vast lake that takes up much of southeastern Sangfielle, and prizes itself as the rare hub of culture in the bloodfields. In recent years, the powerful witch hunting organization called the Glim Macula has grown in power there, owing to the city's focus on furthering \"civilization.\" The Sleeping City: Every 13 years, a metropolis wakes with the buzzing sound of life. Do not cross its borders uninvited, especially not when it and its inhabitants are at rest. Blackwick County: From the mines to the lake, the hills to the flats, the town once called Eastern Folly has felt a little more expansive now that it's out of the hard grip of the old curse. It's people aren't perfect, but they've made it through some dark times, and that's more than most can say. Zevunzolia: Who the hell knows. A miraculous city waiting to be built? A utopian dimension adjacent our own? \"The Seventh Sun Itself,\" I think I heard one of those fools call it. All I know is, however prime and pristine it is in promise, the pricetag keeps going conveniently unmentioned... Facts and Figures Alekest san Geraint, the Margrave of Tescano, the Porcelain Knight (he/him): If you're a long time reader of this publication, Alekest needs no introduction. You know him from his past adventures, like the slaying of the UnSevered Beast or his solitary stand at Cedartree Station. Maybe you forget some of the details, his angst-filled childhood, the fraught years after his mother's death, his uncanny dreams. Well, Knight Pickman seems not to be a reader, if her confusion at the Margrave's arrival is any indication. Etienne Alize (he/him): Deacon of the Blood in the Triadic Pyre, and de facto sawbones aboard the Jade Moon. The Ravening Beast (it/its) : A howl in the mind of Lye Lyken. A beast on the hunt. It haunts through the course of time, the shape of mind. An echo of a possible future? Aterika'Kaal (it/its) : An ambivalent and ancient spirit. Offers the sweet smell and sublime beauty of roses and the sturdy foundation of a root structure. In exchange: Feed it. The Ojan: To call it \"The Ojan River\" is not only to misspeak but to advertise your distance from knowledge. Ojan itself means \"running water,\" and in Ojantani it is the word you attach to other words to mark them as rivers--each just an faint echo of this paragon of waterways. The Jade Moon: A luxurious vessel, the Jade Moon glides up and down the Ojan. You have to work to find its exterior wooden hull, so covered is it in silken, green banners and curtains. Dining, Dancing, Gambling, Live Music, plush living. An engine that churns below. 250 feet long, 50 feet wide. It's a beast, but in the width of the Ojan--in some places over 2 miles wide--it pales. Teak: First mate of the Jade Moon. The Course: There is debate about the true nature of the Heartland's Truth, the power that turned Sangfielle into what it is today . But the Cleavers call it the Course. Part river, part lesson, part direction traveled. Entirely beyond the grasp of mortal minds. The Structure: Reason, logic, sense. The world is, fundamentally, a place that fits together and functions. We may not like that, say the adherents of the structure. And sometimes, the world may move in ways beyond our particular ken. But there is something holding it together, and that, they say, is the Heartland's Truth: The Structure. The Shape: Are the trains that run across the Heartland bound to the Structure, or do they direct it? Is the overlap between the two even real at all, or might two machinic forces be at work here in Sangfielle? Organizations The Broken Quartet: Cello, viola, violin, clarinet. That's all it takes to make people move. Well, that and some skill. The Covenant of Kaitankro: You've seen them, haven't you? The unsettlingly gregarious priests with the strange, chitinous crow masks? Of course you have, with their stilt-legs and their stilt-houses and their collection of stakes and strings and, of course, the kites. I asked one once if it was a pun: Kite and Crow, chitin crow. Something like that. The priestess told me that Kaitankro was a very real god, if a funny one, and that one day, he visited her. Like every morning, she raised each of the town's kites up to the winds in daily worship, and Kaitankro landed on the smallest one—a sight to see, she said, since her god is so large a being. And like a carnivalist, Kaitankro walked down the wire, tips of her talons, until he met the priest at the bottom. There, I was told, they whispered in the priest's ear a single phrase: \"Better to live as birds on wires than die as men in the wind.\" Chaos, it seems, breeds community, too.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for injury that affects mobility, aggressive animals, animal consumption of human flesh, insect infestation, bodily infection, and a description of a gory transformation. The Jade Moon's trip from the sea of Sapodilla back upriver towards Blackwick has a set schedule. 14 days, all accounted for. Meals prepared. Entertainment provided. A small number of stops for shopping, religious needs, and the general stretching of legs. And yet it is the case that some days are longer than others, no matter that they count one each. The day that most of the Blackwick Group, and a new companion, stepped out of the Jade Moon and into the Triadic Pyre's Bridge Cathedral is one such day. This week on Sangfielle: Passage on the Jade Moon Pt. 2 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places The Bridge Cathedral: In the hierarchy of all trains--or is it perhaps capitalized, I do not recall--there is one engine that storms ahead of the others. \"The Burning God Among Iron Trains\" is its name, but the Disciples of the Triadic Pyre call it simply Fire Alight . Well, whatever you might call it, it's a damned big one. And it needs to cross the Ojan like anything else. And thus: The Brdige Cathedral. Largest structure of its kind in Sangfielle or anywhere. At two miles across, it's partly a church, partly grim city, and partly an engineering pit. What are they engineering? Well... It turns out, being the devotees of the Fire Alight shifts your relationship with other trains. At least the ones who, themselves, are under the Burning God's thrawl. Sapodilla : One of, if not the, largest city inside of the walls of Concentus. Sapodilla rests on the western shore of the vast lake that takes up much of southeastern Sangfielle, and prizes itself as the rare hub of culture in the bloodfields. In recent years, the powerful witch hunting organization called the Glim Macula has grown in power there, owing to the city's focus on furthering \"civilization.\" The Sleeping City: Every 13 years, a metropolis wakes with the buzzing sound of life. Do not cross its borders uninvited, especially not when it and its inhabitants are at rest. Blackwick County: From the mines to the lake, the hills to the flats, the town once called Eastern Folly has felt a little more expansive now that it's out of the hard grip of the old curse. It's people aren't perfect, but they've made it through some dark times, and that's more than most can say. Zevunzolia: Who the hell knows. A miraculous city waiting to be built? A utopian dimension adjacent our own? \"The Seventh Sun Itself,\" I think I heard one of those fools call it. All I know is, however prime and pristine it is in promise, the pricetag keeps going conveniently unmentioned... Facts and Figures Etienne Alize (he/him): Deacon of the Blood in the Triadic Pyre, and de facto sawbones aboard the Jade Moon. The Blue Wind: One train among many in the Bridge Cathedral. This one seems to be inhabitted by a more boisterous group of Gandy Dancers than the others. Who could say why? If I had to guess, I'd say that those strange creatures are trying to take the train off of Fire Alight's track and put it back on the regular old Shape. The Ravening Beast (it/its) : A howl in the mind of Lye Lyken. A beast on the hunt. It haunts through the course of time, the shape of mind. An echo of a possible future? Aterika'Kaal (it/its) : An ambivalent and ancient spirit. Offers the sweet smell and sublime beauty of roses and the sturdy foundation of a root structure. In exchange: Feed it. The Course: There is debate about the true nature of the Heartland's Truth, the power that turned Sangfielle into what it is today . But the Cleavers call it the Course. Part river, part lesson, part direction traveled. Entirely beyond the grasp of mortal minds. The Structure: Reason, logic, sense. The world is, fundamentally, a place that fits together and functions. We may not like that, say the adherents of the structure. And sometimes, the world may move in ways beyond our particular ken. But there is something holding it together, and that , they say, is the Heartland's Truth: The Structure. The Shape: Are the trains that run across the Heartland bound to the Structure, or do they direct it? Is the overlap between the two even real at all, or might two machinic forces be at work here in Sangfielle? The Ojan: To call it \"The Ojan River\" is not only to misspeak but to advertise your distance from knowledge. Ojan itself means \"running water,\" and in Ojantani it is the word you attach to other words to mark them as rivers--each just an faint echo of this paragon of waterways. The Jade Moon: A luxurious vessel, the Jade Moon glides up and down the Ojan. You have to work to find its exterior wooden hull, so covered is it in silken, green banners and curtains. Dining, Dancing, Gambling, Live Music, plush living. An engine that churns below. 250 feet long, 50 feet wide. It's a beast, but in the width of the Ojan--in some places over 2 miles wide--it pales. Teak: First mate of the Jade Moon. Organizations Wrights of the Seventh Sun: A secret society dedicated to the construction of Zevunzolia, whatever the cost. Their motivations are many: Some believe that the Devils ought to have continued climbing whent hey escaped hell, that this was not the paradise earned. Otherse believe that Zevunzolia is telos of telos , the end-cause of all end-causes, and thus will inevitably bring itself into being. And given that, to do anything but aid it is to risk exclusion from it, or worse.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for description of a burn injury, injury causing limited motor skills, lack of access to medical care, insect infestation, bodily infection. Among Sangfielle's self-proclaimed adventuring class, the idea of retiring to a riverboat ride is something of an old canard. Everyone says they'll do it one day, but very few ever speak of actually completing such a post-venture vacation. Something always comes up. A scheduling error, or a last minute change in ticket pricing, or another job crossing the desk. Perhaps none have been as lucky as the Blackwick Group. Perhaps none have had friends in such high places.

Oh, our Blackwick Group. They move below even \"the depths of Sapodilla\" now, to a place where cold stone floors drift apart, revealing muck and raw emptiness where mortar should be. And beyond that, a clockwork device like none they've ever seen.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for forced human experimentation, teeth, chemical burns, forced bodily transformation. The Blackwick Group moves with hound-like swiftness through the Interred Citadel towards their quarry. But between the dog and the fox, a dozen-dozen things move. A mumbling stream. A twirl of dried leaves. Shadows on grass. So much to see. And some of the things in between? They hunt too. This week on Sangfielle: Hark! The Citadel Beneath Pt. 3 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Sapodilla : One of, if not the, largest city inside of the walls of Concentus. Sapodilla rests on the western shore of the vast lake that takes up much of southeastern Sangfielle, and prizes itself as the rare hub of culture in the bloodfields. In recent years, the powerful witch hunting organization called the Glim Macula has grown in power there, owing to the city's focus on furthering \"civilization.\" Objects of Interest Notes On the Paradise Medicine: A collection of research notes from Hollowfield, first hypothesizing that there may be medical advances available on or through Zevunzolia that are not available here in Sangfielle. In the second half, Hollowfield seems to write about a particularly destructive compound and its potential medical uses. The Marrisa Lefebvre Trilogy : Apparently, in some other world, Kay'Va stretches further. And in this place, they publish books--mystery books. And in a few of them there's a detective by this name who can't help getting herself into trouble. Facts and Figures Appletun (he/him): Along with his fellow researchers Bleaser and Getta , Appletun pursues academic research as a low-ranking member of the the Wrights of the Seventh Sun. While others under Mabriella study puppets of a physical sort, Appletun's focus is a more flexible sort of marionette: Fictional characters. Mabriella du Feza (she/her): Among the Glim Macula, it is said that Mabriella du Feza is an accomplished interrogator, brilliant scholar, and malicious commander. What goes unsaid, because it is not widely known, is her role as a 'liaison' from another, even more sinister organization. Queen of Puppets. Callix, the Aquiline Marquis (he/him, named but unmet): The last reigning Aldominan ruler of Sapodilla, now holding court below his old city streets. But wait, what's this below his Interred Citadel? Might further boulevards yet roll? Dyre Ode (he/they): When an agent of the almanac pressed this mysterious, masked figure for more information about him, they only repeated their name, as if to ensure we'd print it right, adding \"Dyre with Y but Ode as you'd like, a poem said in praise or a debt gone unpaid. It bothers me little, how you spell that name.\" The Blackwick Group first encountered this myterious figure during their investigation into Roseroot Hall, where they helped him recover his skull. Emma Serchilde (she/her) : One of the most successful investigators in Glim Macula's history, Serchilde made her name ferreting out a group of heritrixes who allegedly served a god of slaughter. Where other witch hunters lean on deductive reasoning or evidence collection, Serchilde's technique is simple: Intimidate witnesses through sheer force of will, using her loyal underlings-- Janis, Aztel, and Nelzo --if it becomes necessary to prove that silence will be met with blood. Which isn't to say that she's afraid to get her own hands dirty. Felix Hollowfield (he/him) : In many ways, brilliant inventor Felix Hollowfield is the reason for the recent surge in Glim Macula activity. Though the group has stalked the streets of Sapodilla for decades, it was Hollowfield's collection of tools that both allowed the Macula to face down truly powerful supernatural foes and put a deep and singular fear in the hearts of Sapodillans. His weapons reveal the hidden, nullify the mystical, and ground the transcendent. Where could he have found such ideas as these? Alaway (varies) : Last seen as the waxy, vampiric minister of Yellowfield, Regan, whose generations-long study of technology led him to dream of (and work towards creating) \"The City of Lights,\" a place of flameless fire, energetic implements, and the safety and freedom to live as one wants. Disposed of, for now at least. But the dream yet lives. Organizations Wrights of the Seventh Sun: A secret society dedicated to the construction of Zevunzolia, whatever the cost. Their motivations are many: Some believe that the Devils ought to have continued climbing whent hey escaped hell, that this was not the paradise earned. Otherse believe that Zevunzolia is telos of telos , the end-cause of all end-causes, and thus will inevitably bring itself into being. And given that, to do anything but aid it is to risk exclusion from it, or worse.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for imprisonment, forced starvation, human body parts used as tools, bones breaking through skin, unwilling bodily transformation, and bodily disfigurement. With the party of Open Gates off to a start above, the Blackwick Group's Es, Marn, and Pickman begin to delve into the Interred Citadel of Callix, The Aquiline Marquis. Somewhere, there in the dark, Chine claws their way towards freedom. But before he can be free, and before anyone can return home to Blackwick, there is much work to be done in the decrepit ruins below… This week on Sangfielle: Hark! The Citadel Beneath Pt. 2 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Sapodilla : One of, if not the, largest city inside of the walls of Concentus. Sapodilla rests on the western shore of the vast lake that takes up much of southeastern Sangfielle, and prizes itself as the rare hub of culture in the bloodfields. In recent years, the powerful witch hunting organization called the Glim Macula has grown in power there, owing to the city's focus on furthering \"civilization.\" Facts and Figures Dyre Ode (he/they): When an agent of the almanac pressed this mysterious, masked figure for more information about him, they only repeated their name, as if to ensure we'd print it right, adding \"Dyre with Y but Ode as you'd like, a poem said in praise or a debt gone unpaid. It bothers me little, how you spell that name.\" The Blackwick Group first encountered this myterious figure during their investigation into Roseroot Hall, where they helped him recover his skull. Emma Serchilde (she/her) : One of the most successful investigators in Glim Macula's history, Serchilde made her name ferreting out a group of heritrixes who allegedly served a god of slaughter. Where other witch hunters lean on deductive reasoning or evidence collection, Serchilde's technique is simple: Intimidate witnesses through sheer force of will, using her loyal underlings-- Janis, Aztel, and Nelzo --if it becomes necessary to prove that silence will be met with blood. Which isn't to say that she's afraid to get her own hands dirty. William Blick (he/him) : Head of the Macula's Honorguard, once a ceremonial unit with ties to the rituals of Sapodilla's liberation, now little more than a bunch of door-kicking bullies. Felix Hollowfield (he/him) : In many ways, brilliant inventor Felix Hollowfield is the reason for the recent surge in Glim Macula activity. Though the group has stalked the streets of Sapodilla for decades, it was Hollowfield's collection of tools that both allowed the Macula to face down truly powerful supernatural foes and put a deep and singular fear in the hearts of Sapodillans. His weapons reveal the hidden, nullify the mystical, and ground the transcendent. Where could he have found such ideas as these? Alaway (varies) : Last seen as the waxy, vampiric minister of Yellowfield, Regan, whose generations-long study of technology led him to dream of (and work towards creating) \"The City of Lights,\" a place of flameless fire, energetic implements, and the safety and freedom to live as one wants. Disposed of, for now at least. But the dream yet lives. Mabriella du Feza (she/her): Among the Glim Macula, it is said that Mabriella du Feza is an accomplished interrogator, brilliant scholar, and malicious commander. What goes unsaid, because it is not widely known, is her role as a 'liaison' from another, even more sinister organization. Organizations The Shape Knights: It took people with clear minds, great ingenuity, and implacable spirit to face down and defeat one of the living trains of Sangfielle. In the time since, they've crafted armor from their slain foe, and with that have come to be experts of all things train. They herd, they breach, they redirect. But they haven't yet killed a second.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for imprisonment, gun violence, kidnapping, blindfolding, binding, blood, branding, and the cutting of skin. Once a year, people gather across Sapodilla to celebrate the day, hundreds of years ago, that the Citadel of Callix, The Aquiline Marquis, was brought low and the doors to the city were thrown open, welcoming in refugees from the panic. It is called The Open Gates, and all day and night, music, meter, and meal fill the day and night with merriment. Held breaths are released, rivalries relaxed, and a common pride blossoms.

In the dark acreage under Pledge House, Duvall, Lyke, and Virtue confront the unthinkable. But like all unthinkable things, it begs to be thought through, to be considered, to be turned around in one's mind. There, it lashes and grows and reaches, wooing and harming in equal part. Until, finally, the unthinkable isn't . It is instead all that can be thought. It is an identifying scar. It is raw opportunity. It is the only thing that matters.

      "description": "This episode content warnings for insect infestation of a human body, hallucinations, destructive fire, people trapped during fire, implied death. Across every district of Sapodilla, the Glim Macula's crackdown continues, \"justifying\" their increased presence with the recent deaths of two customs guards. Heritrixes and other's touched by the Heartland's truth continue to go missing. The moon grows ever longer. This city is a held breath. But for those with the wealth or connections to attend Davia Pledge's return to public performance, release seems only nights away. And they are half-right: The grand re-opening of the Pledge House Concert Hall will certainly be an exhalation, of a sort. This week on Sangfielle: The Perpetual Oratorio of Davia Pledge Pt. 3 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Sapodilla: One of, if not the, largest city inside of the walls of Concentus. Sapodilla rests on the western shore of the vast lake that takes up much of southeastern Sangfielle, and prizes itself as the rare hub of culture in the bloodfields. In recent years, the powerful witch hunting organization called the Glim Macula has grown in power there, owing to the city's focus on furthering \"civilization.\" Pledge House: A mysterious manor in Sapodilla's Hibiscus District. Thirty odd years ago, a fire ravaged its attached (and magnificent) concert hall. In two days time, a rebuilt concert hall will host Davia Pledge's grand return to the stage. Objects of Interest Sa'Ferna-ta-Fera: Translated loosely to \"Talking with Ferna the Cunning,\" Sa'Ferna-ta-Fera is an approximate transcription of a long, free-flowing conversation between an unnamed scholar and the pre-Panic Carpana sage, Ferna. The transcriber, a bastard child of a Great House of Aldomina who used his connection to Ferna's tribe to initiate the process, hoped to capture the wisdom of the sage and rewrite it as a dissertation on the folk knowledge of Sangfielle. When Ferna convinced him to instead attempt to publish the transcript as-is, the bastard scholar found that publishers in both the First and Third Cantons refused to print it. Facts and Figures Lenore Voivode (he/him): In the pre-Panic heartland, Lenore was the nebbish and prissy human thrall to Lord Asator Crosley , one of Virtue's many rival vampire lords. Today, he is of the blood in his own right, the Night Librarian of the prestigious Rotundana library, and a member of the Telluricist Union.

And now, Darling's own ghastly existence is tied to her twice-undead prey's. Emma Serchilde (she/her) : One of the most successful investigators in Glim Macula's history, Serchilde made her name ferreting out a group of heritrixes who allegedly served a god of slaughter. Where other witch hunters lean on deductive reasoning or evidence collection, Serchilde's technique is simple: Intimidate witnesses through sheer force of will, using her loyal underlings-- Janis, Aztel, and Nelzo --if it becomes necessary to prove that silence will be met with blood. Which isn't to say that she's afraid to get her own hands dirty. Felix Hollowfield (he/him) : In many ways, brilliant inventor Felix Hollowfield is the reason for the recent surge in Glim Macula activity. Though the group has stalked the streets of Sapodilla for decades, it was Hollowfield's collection of tools that both allowed the Macula to face down truly powerful supernatural foes and put a deep and singular fear in the hearts of Sapodillans. His weapons reveal the hidden, nullify the mystical, and ground the transcendent. Where could he have found such ideas as these? Aterika'Kaal : An ambivalent and ancient spirit. Offers the sweet smell and sublime beauty of roses and the sturdy foundation of a root structure. In exchange: Feed it. Only a small, dangerous Becker Arbogast (he/they): This apathetic god of doctors takes the form of a mature adult. He is very short and has an overmuscled build. They have bone-white hair worn in a style that resembles a rocky outcropping. Their slitted eyes are alabaster. His body is covered in fur. They are usually portrayed as wearing a strange suit of armor (which incorporates abstract designs) and a ring. He carries a satchel of medical herbs. Tombo (he/him): Lye Lychen's argumentative (but loyal) fish companion.

Empty faces. A flame that burns through you. Witch hunters in white coats. The Telluricist Union: Made up by a mix of peoples driven to the hills by Aldomina, this group of knife sharpeners, herbalists, geologists, and all around investigators have made it their job to keep their old wisdom and see it used to help those in need. The best among them are called Keen. The Boundless Conclave: Less of an individual church, more of an association between hundreds of independent faiths.

      "description": "This episode content warnings for insect infestation of a human body, involuntary unconsciousness caused by violence, restraints, police violence, death, flesh-eating creature, and blood. It wasn't supposed to go like this. It was just a quick stop at the Night Library to research a few topics of interest, a little legwork before the real action begins. But the gates of the Glim Macula are not opened by intent alone. Thus it is that Duvall, Lyke, and Virtue must now face down a quintet of the Macula's most fearsome investigators with the wall to their backs, a deep pit of knowledge below, and light itself turned against them. This week on Sangfielle: The Perpetual Oratorio of Davia Pledge Pt. 2 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Sapodilla: One of, if not the, largest city inside of the walls of Concentus. Sapodilla rests on the western shore of the vast lake that takes up much of southeastern Sangfielle, and prizes itself as the rare hub of culture in the bloodfields. In recent years, the powerful witch hunting organization called the Glim Macula has grown in power there, owing to the city's focus on furthering \"civilization.\" Pledge House: A mysterious manor in Sapodilla's Hibiscus District. Thirty odd years ago, a fire ravaged its attached (and magnificent) concert hall. In two days time, a rebuilt concert hall will host Davia Pledge's grand return to the stage. Objects of Interest Sa'Ferna-ta-Fera: Translated loosely to \"Talking with Ferna the Cunning,\" Sa'Ferna-ta-Fera is an approximate transcription of a long, free-flowing conversation between an unnamed scholar and the pre-Panic Carpana sage, Ferna. The transcriber, a bastard child of a Great House of Aldomina who used his connection to Ferna's tribe to initiate the process, hoped to capture the wisdom of the sage and rewrite it as a dissertation on the folk knowledge of Sangfielle. When Ferna convinced him to instead attempt to publish the transcript as-is, the bastard scholar found that publishers in both the First and Third Cantons refused to print it. Facts and Figures Lenore Voivode (he/him): In the pre-Panic heartland, Lenore was the nebbish and prissy human thrall to Lord Asator Crosley , one of Virtue's many rival vampire lords. Today, he is of the blood in his own right, the Night Librarian of the prestigious Rotundana library, and a member of the Telluricist Union. Lady Zizilliana \"Zizi\" Esterházy (she/her): Once a well known artist of Sapodilla, Zizi reportedly died during the great fire of Pledge House. According to the book Remembering the Zahir , Lady Esterhazy was the last known owner of the titular Zahir, a painting which supposedly fates the person watching it to develop over time into their apprehension of either the subject of the painting or a striking yet elusive figure in the painting's far distance. Davia Pledge (she/her): \"The mad composer of Sapodilla\" who vanished from the public view for decades after the fire of Pledge House. Every year, they say, she invites a select few to a private concert of her newest composition, and getting an invite is either a high honor or a mark of one's own corruption, depending on which aristocrat you ask. In the past year, her name has become widely known not for her concerts, but for \"Pledge Cylinders,\" recordings which produce crisp, beautiful music, though by what devilry it is not known. Darling Malice (she/her) : Once, Darling Malice hunted Virtue Mondegreen across the whole of the heartland. She even managed to kill her. But that didn't stick, it seems. And now, Darling's own ghastly existence is tied to her twice-undead prey's. Emma Serchilde (she/her) : One of the most successful investigators in Glim Macula's history, Serchilde made her name ferreting out a group of heritrixes who allegedly served a god of slaughter. Where other witch hunters lean on deductive reasoning or evidence collection, Serchilde's technique is simple: Intimidate witnesses through sheer force of will, using her loyal underlings-- Janis, Aztel, and Nelzo --if it becomes necessary to prove that silence will be met with blood. Which isn't to say that she's afraid to get her own hands dirty. Felix Hollowfield (he/him) : In many ways, brilliant inventor Felix Hollowfield is the reason for the recent surge in Glim Macula activity. Though the group has stalked the streets of Sapodilla for decades, it was Hollowfield's collection of tools that both allowed the Macula to face down truly powerful supernatural foes and put a deep and singular fear in the hearts of Sapodillans. His weapons reveal the hidden, nullify the mystical, and ground the transcendent. Where could he have found such ideas as these? Aterika'Kaal : An ambivalent and ancient spirit. Offers the sweet smell and sublime beauty of roses and the sturdy foundation of a root structure. In exchange: Feed it. Only a small, dangerous Becker Arbogast (he/they): This apathetic god of doctors takes the form of a mature adult. He is very short and has an overmuscled build. They have bone-white hair worn in a style that resembles a rocky outcropping. Their slitted eyes are alabaster. His body is covered in fur. They are usually portrayed as wearing a strange suit of armor (which incorporates abstract designs) and a ring. He carries a satchel of medical herbs. Tombo (he/him): Lye Lychen's argumentative (but loyal) fish companion. Organizations Glim Macula: Whether Sapodilla looks postcard-perfect to you or if you find yourself looking for a place to spit when someone repeats the claim that it is the \"most civilized\" corner of the heartland, it is the Glim Macula you have to thank. Empty faces. A flame that burns through you. Witch hunters in white coats. The Telluricist Union: Made up by a mix of peoples driven to the hills by Aldomina, this group of knife sharpeners, herbalists, geologists, and all around investigators have made it their job to keep their old wisdom and see it used to help those in need. The best among them are called Keen. The Boundless Conclave: Less of an individual church, more of an association between hundreds of independent faiths. Small sects, nearly forgotten cults, and unjealous gods make up this vast pantheon.

Sapodilla shutters early today. The Macula is in the street, looking for even more blood than usual. And yet three of those they're looking for—the vampire Virtue Mondegreen, the newly waxen Duvall, and the associatively guilty Lye Lyken—are prowling the city in their own hunt, in search of a secretive library.

Sapodilla has always been the sort of city that finds its way into the heart of a story. A place in touch with its seaside bearing, colored by the sun's reflection against the water. A place where high towers rise at the corners of high walls, cutting the metropolis into little puzzle pieces. And centuries ago, during the panic, when the petty local lords who'd conquered Sangfielle fled and left behind those they'd chained, Sapodilla became the best kind of place: a refuge. It's ancient gates opened, its people overruled the rulers and waved banners of welcome from the parapets and invited in all kinds of folk to escape calamity, to recover, and to rebuild. What they built was new: A social cornucopia by the shore. Unfortunately, that Sapodilla ain't with us anymore. So proud of what was built--the cultural epicenter of Sangfielle--they forgot how and why they built in the first place. Today, under the watchful and frightening gaze of the Glim Macula, the so-called \"defenders of society\" who are little more than dressed up witch hunters, Sapodilla has closed its ancient gates. And entry makes demands… This week on Sangfielle: At the Gates of Sapodilla The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Sapodilla: One of, if not the, largest city inside of the walls of Concentus.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for death, experimentation on a person, loss of consciousness and bodily control, magical captivity, and forced bodily transformation. In Sangfielle, it's rare enough to find an answer to a mystery, and rarer still to find one with the clarity and quality needed to convince someone else that it is, in fact, an answer at all. Such is the case with Lye Lychen, Pickman, and Duvall here in Bell Metal Station. Yes, they have a truth—a Truth even, with a capital T—but to those on the outside, it looks and feels like something else. Too impossible, too painful, too volatile to be the truth. But it always is. And it is in this moment of volatility that, for the first time, the Blackwick Group can see something larger take shape. Something with the sort of fatal and formative force that transforms pleasant parts into uneasy wholes. This week on Sangfielle: What Happened at Bell Metal Station Pt. 4 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Bell Metal Station: The broad, 10 story tall station that the Bell Metal Band operates out of. Hard, metal-reinforced stonework. Scaffolding on scaffolding. Wood and leather and old picture frames. A middle space between laboratory, bunker, and den. Sapodilla: One of, if not the, largest city inside of the walls of Concentus. Sapodilla rests on the western shore of the vast lake that takes up much of southeastern Sangfielle, and prizes itself as the rare hub of culture in the bloodfields. In recent years, the powerful witch hunting organization called the Glim Macula has grown in power there, owing to the city's focus on furthering \"civilization.\" Zevunzolia: The hypothesized city of cities, the telos behind telos, the place high above, the heaven yet to be reached. A utopian dream pursued at great lengths by the secretive Wrights of hte Seventh Sun. Banderole: The City of Banners. People all around Sangfielle have been dreaming of it. Some even build models of it in their sleep... Facts and Figures Erm (he/him) : The leader of the Bell Metal Band truly is just a little guy, but that don't be confused: he's absolutely the boss around here! Chomps cigars, wears custom Shape train armor featuring the Bell Metal Band emblem. His white and brown fur is like a guinea pig's, but covered in soot and smoke. Omerra Celendi (she/her, he/him) : A human mage--with a speciality in alchemical inventions--from the Unschola Republica in his late 20s. She frames her light brown skin face with wavy dark hair down to her shoulders and big round glasses and wears a playful grin on his face. Today, it's high waisted, dark green corduroy slacks, a sleeveless white button up blouse, a single powered shape knight gauntlets on his right hand, a pauldron and half-plate piece that covers the left side of her torso, and a sort of dark gold halfcape across the other side. Tomorrow it will be something even more immaculate. Calen fel Dynestia (he/him): Heir to a grim line, Calen has joined the Shape Knights in an effort to rehabilitate the fel Dynestia name. Eyes sunken, pasty purple face covered with stubble, and all the highest fashion of Sapodilla circa twenty years ago. Fezh (they/them): Soft for a Shape Knight. Strong for a Shape Knight. The closest there was to everyone in Bell Metal, but Calen most of all. Missed greatly. High Vicar Regan Alaway (currently he/him) : Waxy, vampiric minister of Yellowfield, whose generations-long study of technology led him to dream of (and work towards creating) \"The City of Lights,\" a place of flameless fire, energetic implements, and the safety and freedom to live as one wants. Disposed of, for now at least. Tombo (he/him): Lye Lychen's argumentative (but loyal) fish companion. Jolyon (they/them): An old friend. Swears they aren't the train. Prince Alexander: A train turned over before its time, if such a thing exists. Mirlande (she/her): A senior Star-Touched agent of Kay'va on her final assignment. Ekule Polyte (he/him): The Blackwick group first met this \"Star-Touched\" Kay'van agent under the pseudonym of \"Janek,\" hiding out in Blackwick County. Now, he waits patiently for extraction. Katonya (she/her): A cleaver near the end of her career, Katonya's body bears all the marks of years in service to the Heartland. Loyal to those who employ her, and a walking catastrophe to those she opposes. The Red Zephyr: A train what takes on strange character under the moonlight. For a month, it's torn into not only Bell Metal Station, but also any passing train it could reach. A problem severe enough that the Shape Knights so troubled reached out for help from the biggest Cleaver they'd ever met. Agdeline (she/her), Ettel (he/him), and Larch (he/him) : This devil, drakkan, and human trio once spent time mining in the hills of Blackwick. In recent times, they've found that poorly armed travelers make for better prospecting. Sometimes called \"the Toll Collectors.\" Organizations Glim Macula: Whether Sapodilla looks postcard-perfect to you or if you find yourself looking for a place to spit when someone repeats the claim that it is the \"most civilized\" corner of the heartland, it is the Glim Macula you have to thank. Empty faces. A flame that burns through you. Witch hunters in white coats. Wrights of the Seventh Sun: A secret society dedicated to the construction of Zevunzolia, whatever the cost. Their motivations are many: Some believe that the Devils ought to have continued climbing whent hey escaped hell, that this was not the paradise earned. Otherse believe that Zevunzolia is telos of telos , the end-cause of all end-causes, and thus will inevitably bring itself into being. And given that, to do anything but aid it is to risk exclusion from it, or worse. The Star-Touched (unspoken): In Kay'Va, it is said that the stars are the first thing we see which belong to everyone. And so, just as the light from the innumerable touched their souls, they too shall shine out from the countless isles and brighten the mainland. In plaintongue, these agents of the Free Seas have been granted unique knowledge and remarkable aptitudes--no two operatives have been received the same gifts yet. And they use those talents for the sake of Kay'Va, serving as envoys, investigators, killers, organizers, and everything else that must be done for the safety of the seas and the spread of Cartinism. The Bell Metal Band: Of all the Shape Knight gangs, the Bell Metal Band might be the most curious (in both meanings of the word). From their tall station at the intersection of two major Shape lines, the Bell Metal Band tries to yank away whatever train parts they can safely reach for study and, frankly, for fun. In the recent days, though, they've come under some sort of trouble and have put out a call for help. The Shape Knights : It took people with clear minds, great ingenuity, and implacable spirit to face down and defeat one of the living trains of Sangfielle. In the time since, they've crafted armor from their slain foe, and with that have come to be experts of all things train. They herd, they breach, they redirect. But they haven't yet killed a second. Cleavers: Given how loose and fluid this collection of monster hunters, mystery solvers, and naturalists is, it's hard to call them \"an organization.\" But when the central belief system of a group is that everything is ever in flux, well, give them the credit of applying that particular ontology to themselves, and take them at their word.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for description of corpses and death by burning, the discussion of mind control, serious bruising, and the loss of motor skills. Welcomed into Bell Metal Station, Lye Lychen finds himself separated from his compatriots by miles, but it is a gap in information that makes him truly distant. While the junk mage tries to complete a puzzle despite a missing piece, Duvall and Pickman instead find themselves looking at an unexpected extra. As the sun begins to rise in the plains north of Sapodilla, things begin to come into focus. But sometimes, the light only brings more questions.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for insect infestation of a human, bodily transformation, description of organs and interior of a body, serious bruising, loss of motor skills, vomit, temporal disorientation, and death. So far, so good. Lyke, Duvall, and Pickman navigated a skeletal riddle, drove away some uncanny engineers, and connected with a monster hunter who veers towards the monstrous herself. Normal, at least in so far as this particular tale of the abnormal goes, anyway. But now they've turned south towards Bell Metal station, and soon enough the strange will get stranger. Things could have gone differently here, stayed on script, so to speak. But the Blackwick Group is never happier than when taking things from an unpredictable angle. Ain't that what makes them so charming? This week on Sangfielle: What Happened at Bell Metal Station Pt. 2 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Bell Metal Station: The broad, 10 story tall station that the Bell Metal Band operates out of.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for insects and the insect infestation of a human, the depiction of a supernaturally bubbling and oil-like skin, and a mention of blood. To say that this particular story starts off in a strange way would be the underselling of a lifetime. But that's how things are sometimes. Sometimes, in pursuit of a missing eggsac--which we know isn't even in this direction--an unlikely trio sets off towards an abandoned town, and on the way finds themselves at the wrong end of blade and riddle. Yet by the end of it all, in stories like this, they find themselves confronted with horrors physical and existential. So it goes in Sangfielle. So it goes. Today on Sangfielle: What Happened at Bell Metal Station The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Sapodilla: One of, if not the, largest city inside of the walls of Concentus. Sapodilla rests on the western shore of the vast lake that takes up much of southeastern Sangfielle, and prizes itself as the rare hub of culture in the bloodfields. In recent years, the powerful witch hunting organization called the Glim Macula has grown in power there, owing to the city's focus on furthering \"civilization.\" The Waterlogged Kingdom: At least that's what we're calling it for now. Deep under the water, an empress waits. There's been debate: Did they turn the wood from her sunken ship into a palace for her? Build castles out of the lake sand? Maybe they never stopped marching, and they're down there right now, just going round in circles. An likely area of inquiry, for certain. Facts and Figures Chantilly Scathe (she/her): The signs and barkers rarely say her name alone. She ain't Chantilly, or even Ms. Scathe, she's always \"Ms. Chantilly Scathe and Her Shackled Engine.\" Don't let her showmanship and ringmaster garb fool you though: She seems to have done what no Shape Knight could: Make a train of the Shape, The Grand Cormorant Limited, her very own pet. Phendleton (they/them) and Brace (he/him): Representatives of the so-called True Loyalists of the Sunken Empress. What makes them \"true loyalists\"? Well, if we knew that, things would be a lot simpler, wouldn't they? The Sunken Empress Altapasqua (she/her): Around fifty years after the panic set in, Altapasqua told her people she would ride across this cursed land and purge it of its disease and danger. She only made it about three fourths of the way. And well, it's as expected. She was down there ever since. Agdeline (she/her), Ettel (he/him), and Larch (he/him) : This devil, drakkan, and human trio once spent time mining in the hills of Blackwick. In recent times, they've found that poorly armed travelers make for better prospecting. Sometimes called \"the Toll Collectors.\" Katonya (she/her): A cleaver near the end of her career, Katonya's body bears all the marks of years in service to the Heartland. Loyal to those who employ her, and a walking catastrophe to those she opposes.

      "description": "This episode contains content warnings for violence, eye and bodily transformation, bodily experimentation, mind control, and the eating of glass (without harm). Sometimes you think you've got it all figured out, and rightly so. You've done your due dilligence, crossed your T's and dotted your I's, asked all the right questions to all the right people. And its these specific cases when you are most taken by surprise with the truth of the thing. It goes without saying that the case Yellowfield Candle Company is one such endeavor. The truth slips through the fingers, and only one thing's for sure: it's a wax house, baby—we all just live in it. This week on Sangfielle: The Candle Factory Pt. 3 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Yellowfield : Before the Panic this little valley of yellow flowers was the territory of a petty wizard and the subjects he frightened or beguiled. He called it his Xanthic Demesne, but these days we just call it Yellowfield. In the center of the valley, there's a candle factory, and it is here that the old axiom refers: \"All the candle light in Sangfielle was made with just twenty odd hands.\" Sapodilla: One of, if not the largest city inside of the walls of Concentus. Sapodilla is on the western shore of Sangfielle's inland sea, and its leaders have gotten very good at selling it as a postcard pretty, tiered seaside paradise where civilization and culture are defended unlike anywhere else in Sangfielle. Well. it certainly is right to say that the way they defend their culture is unique, but the rest of it? Call me a skeptic. Facts and Figures High Vicar Regan Alaway (currently he/him, changes over time): The de facto leader of Yellowfield, the vicar preaches daily in the Factory's churchfront. A charismatic figure with a bright vision for the future. Gala (she/her): A young worker at the candle factory, Gala has grown increasingly concerned about the state of Yellowfield and the high vicar. Now, her concern grows to worry as her mother, Galena, has gone missing. Eyes, Ears, and Mouth: These three Caprak—loyal to the full extent of loyalty to Alaway—are no talk, all action. Subsolum: When a reporter passing east requested comment from the High Vicar on the distinguished deity worshipped at Yellowfield's only chapel, she was told only this: \"My god is of the underneath, you see. The soil and the fertility in it. The deep soil, you understand. The soil that gives us these wonderful flowers.\" Well that was a crock of shit, wasn't it? Not sure what to think about this one. Was there actually a Subsolum once? Is the Lord of Yellowfield Subsolum, self-proclaimed or in golden honesty? Is the whole thing a con? Who the hell knows. Bucho (he/him) (mentioned): Whether you first hear of him as \"Big Bucho\" or \"Two Step Bucho,\" once you meet him, you'll understand that no name does the gallant Shape Knight justice. Rana (she/her): An lonely devotee of Kaitankro who now lives out her days attending to one of her chosen god's many kite-shrines. Organizations The Shape Knights : It took people with clear minds, great ingenuity, and implacable spirit to face down and defeat one of the living trains of Sangfielle. In the time since, they've crafted armor from their slain foe, and with that have come to be experts of all things train. They herd, they breach, they redirect. But they haven't yet killed a second.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for discussion of a missing person, depiction of a bound and wounded person, and brief depiction of torture. From the heights of the stilted shrine of Kitankro, the valley of Yellowfield is a soporific refuge from the rest of Sangfielle. Absent are the dustorms, the chimeric creatures, and sharp shapes of bonewashed geology. Instead, the wind blows through and endless field of yellow. Little figures move to and fro, between factory and farmhouse. Even the trains arrive at an easy glide below, predictable and safe. Yes, from the heights of the stilted shrine of Kitankro, the valley of Yellowfield looks quite nice indeed. This week on Sangfielle: The Candle Factory Pt. 2 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Yellowfield : Before the Panic this little valley of yellow flowers was the territory of a petty wizard and the subjects he frightened or beguiled. He called it his Xanthic Demesne, but these days we just call it Yellowfield. In the center of the valley, there's a candle factory, and it is here that the old axiom refers: \"All the candle light in Sangfielle was made with just twenty odd hands.\" Facts and Figures High Vicar Regan Alaway (he/him): The de facto leader of Yellowfield, the vicar preaches daily in the Factory's churchfront. A charismatic figure with a bright vision for the future. Gala (she/her): A young worker at the candle factory, Gala has grown increasingly concerned about the state of Yellowfield and the high vicar. Now, her concern grows to worry as her mother, Galena, has gone missing. Eyes, Ears, and Mouth: These three Caprak—loyal to the full extent of loyalty to Alaway—are no talk, all action. Subsolum: When a reporter passing east requested comment from the High Vicar on the distinguished deity worshipped at Yellowfield's only chapel, she was told only this: \"My god is of the underneath, you see. The soil and the fertility in it. The deep soil, you understand. The soil that gives us these wonderful flowers.\" Bucho (he/him) (mentioned): Whether you first hear of him as \"Big Bucho\" or \"Two Step Bucho,\" once you meet him, you'll understand that no name does the gallant Shape Knight justice. Rana (she/her): An lonely devotee of Kaitankro who now lives out her days attending to one of her chosen god's many kite-shrines. Organizations The Covenant of Kaitankro: You've seen them, haven't you? The unsettlingly gregarious priests with the strange, chitinous crow masks? Of course you have, with their stilt-legs and their stilt-houses and their collection of stakes and strings and, of course, the kites. I asked one once if it was a pun: Kite and Crow, chitin crow. Something like that. The priestess told me that Kaitankro was a very real god, if a funny one, and that one day, he visited her. Like every morning, she raised each of the town's kites up to the winds in daily worship, and Kaitankro landed on the smallest one—a sight to see, she said, since her god is so large a being. And like a carnivalist, Kaitankro walked down the wire, tips of her talons, until he met the priest at the bottom. There, I was told, they whispered in the priest's ear a single phrase: \"Better to live as birds on wires than die as men in the wind.\" Chaos, it seems, breeds community, too. The Shape Knights : It took people with clear minds, great ingenuity, and implacable spirit to face down and defeat one of the living trains of Sangfielle. In the time since, they've crafted armor from their slain foe, and with that have come to be experts of all things train. They herd, they breach, they redirect. But they haven't yet killed a second.

      "description": "This episode contains content warnings for teeth, implied harm to animals, and alcohol. With a loud cry, the truth began to spread through Blackwick County. The mysterious egg sac once nestled into the recovered nest structure had been stolen and its guards coldcocked. Now, the Blackwick Group must trace it down, confront whoever's taken it, and bring it back… before a curse falls on Blackwick yet again. This week on Sangfielle: The Candle Factory Pt. 1 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Peoples Caprak (cap-ROK): The goat folks of the northlands, where they put up with dust, ash, snow, and the unilateral \"justice\" of the Pale Magistratum. Carpana (car - pahn - a) : They're little folks, three to four feet tall or so. A little like capybara, I suppose. Devils : Once, they were contained by (and made to administer) some vast network of hells. But they fought their way out, took over Aldomina, and nurtured a fledgling empire into an expansive one. Drakkan (drah-KAHN): I've always thought we look like seahorses. Skin pulled across spiny, exo-skeletal armor. Bright colors. Good looking. Heritrixes (hare-uh-trixes) : Heritrixes are immaterial beings, sometimes confused for ghosts, demons, or other sorts of supernatural spirits, who enter into contracts with physical hosts. Human: A smooth-skinned, hornless type of person, mostly found in the Heartland and in the Unschola Republica these days. Unremarkable. \"Except in variety,\" you'll often hear a human say, revealing only that they're more prideful than wise. Ojantani: The Ojantani, who share traits with buffalo and water oxen, are as often melancholic or timorous as they are the loud, stereotypical minotaur sort. Places Yellowfield : Before the Panic this little valley of yellow flowers was the territory of a petty wizard and the subjects he frightened or beguiled. He called it his Xanthic Demesne, but these days we just call it Yellowfield. In the center of the valley, there's a candle factory, and it is here that the old axiom refers: \"All the candle light in Sangfielle was made with just twenty odd hands.\" Facts and Figures Rana (she/her): An lonely devotee of Kaitankro who now lives out her days attending to one of her chosen god's many kite-shrines. Agdeline (she/her), Ettel (he/him), and Larch (he/him) : This devil, drakkan, and human trio once spent time mining in the hills of Blackwick. In recent times, they've found that poorly armed travelers make for better prospecting. Sometimes called \"the Toll Collectors.\" Bucho (he/him) (mentioned): Whether you first hear of him as \"Big Bucho\" or \"Two Step Bucho,\" once you meet him, you'll understand that no name does the gallant Shape Knight justice. Organizations The Covenant of Kaitankro: You've seen them, haven't you? The unsettlingly gregarious priests with the strange, chitinous crow masks?

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for skin blisters and boils, hallucinations, and scrimshaw done in teeth. There is a sense of verve in the air by the time the suns rise on Blackwick, today. Visitors arrive from every entry: A magnificent shape train at the station. A caravan and its bazaar. The grand opening of a new trade hall. A line of nuns, faces blooming bright and colorful. Yes, oh yes. It is Market Day in Blackwick. This week on Sangfielle: Market Day in Blackwick The Almanac of the Heartland Rider This issue of the Heartland Rider is brought to you by The Open Hand Trade Hall and its Chief Patron, Dayward yon Vantzon-Estonbergh, who would like you to know that he says\"Remember: I might be from Aldomina, but the Open Hand is -A Blackwick ' Original'-\" Organizations The Boundless Conclave: Less of an individual church, more of an association between hundreds of independent faiths. Small sects, nearly forgotten cults, and unjealous gods make up this vast pantheon. The Caravan of the Coin: Cursed by Ribbadon, Frog God of Wealth, these traveling merchant-clerics never arrive at a destination carrying what they expect. Sisters of the Mother-Beast: A dedicated priory of worshippers of a now-dead god, their faith now in a moment of transition towards a new figure of worship... Facts and Figures Erlin, the Tactful God of Lakes (he/him): People don't often think of \"lakeness,\" and that's because Erlin does the thinking for you. He embodies the relaxing, if humid, depths of Sangfielle's many lakes. Dr. Vellete Vandrake (she/her): Freelance Physic of Blackwick, Dr. Vandrake has mixed feelings on the influx of newcomers to Blackwick. On one hand, there's more work—and more income—than ever. On the other, there are more people than ever to complain about her bedside manner. Slumbous (any): A minor god of the Boundless Conclave, who is associated with the ritual practice of putting one's candles out at night, but whose domains extend beyond that to include the more general realm of routines of care and rituals of restfulness. Often depicted in a big, crooked hat. Stanislaka (she/they) : Marisha's replacement, the new attendant of the Boundless Conclave temple, an young ojantani whose faith to Slumbous knows no bounds. Chantilly Scathe (she/her): The signs and barkers rarely say her name alone. She ain't Chantilly, or even Ms. Scathe, she's always \"Ms. Chantilly Scathe and Her Shackled Engine.\" Don't let her showmanship and ringmaster garb fool you though: She seems to have done what no Shape Knight could: Make a train of the Shape, The Grand Cormorant Limited, her very own pet. Babor Mirah (they/them) : As the Trade-Medium of one of nomadic clans of the Caravan of the Coin, Babor serves as a leader Myron Andrashi (they/them): A reporter—and a damned good one—for this very publication, the Serialized Almanac of the Heartland Rider. Aterika'Kaal aka \"Roseroot\" aka \"Rose Shade\" : An ambivalent and ancient spirit. Offers the sweet smell and sublime beauty of roses and the sturdy foundation of a root structure. In exchange: Feed it. Only a small, dangerous branch of the deity remains. Genburi (he/him) : What's there to be said about that old rat that people don't already know? A divine professor, taller than most, with an eye as much for provocative fashion as book learning. Wears a lot of purple. Knows a bunch of languages. Not much else to say. Dayward yon Vantzon-Estonbergh aka Dayward YVE (he/him) : The moneyed scion of a minor Aldominan dynasty, Dayward YVE has traveled to the Heartland as both eager-apologist and curious explorer. Sensing opportunity, he's settled in Blackwick County. Dyre Ode (he/they) : When an agent of the almanac pressed this mysterious, masked figure for more information about him, they only repeated their name, as if to ensure we'd print it right, adding \"Dyre with Y but Ode as you'd like, a poem said in praise or a debt gone unpaid. It bothers me little, how you spell that name.\" Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Sylvi Clare ( @sylvibullet ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora and Austin Walker Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Text by Austin Walker Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

Safe in the company of the Didacts of Genburi, Lye Lychen, Duvall, and Es have a moment to rest and consider their options. Between this studious temple and the safety of Blackwick is the realm of Aterika'Kaal, twisted demi-god. And even beyond its reach, there is Roseroot Hall, where its blood thirsty remains sit in the manor's hidden heart, bound by unholy contract to Dayward YVE. If that was not enough, there is, also, the matter of the relic skull, ripped from the creature's roots. Much to consider, they think. Much to consider.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for description of haunting, disorientation, dissociation, insect infestation of a human body, and discussion of slavery, sacrifice, and mass death. Having arrived at Roseroot Hall, the Blackwick Group's investigation into the manor's supposed haunting may finally begin. The methodology is familiar: One must walk the grounds, take in the passive energies of its passageways, attend to first hand accounts, pore over the home's books, share tea and supper with its distressed master. Here, and rarely in the place that one might guess, is the answer. This week on Sangfielle: The Secret Ledger of Roseroot Hall Pt. 2 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Roseroot Hall : Now in the northern hills of Blackwick County, Roseroot Hall once stood mighty and imperious as a plantation house in the eastern half of the Heartland. Though the yon Vantzon-Estonbergh held it once, it fell into disrepair sometime after the panic. Details have been lost to time. Facts and Figures Dayward yon Vantzon-Estonbergh aka Dayward YVE (he/him) : The moneyed scion of a minor Aldominan dynasty, Dayward YVE has traveled to the Heartland as both eager-apologist and curious explorer. Sensing opportunity, he's settled in Blackwick County. Ana Berylia (she/her) : Dayward YVE's maid, a somewhat overwhelmed Carpana who has not adjusted to life in the Heartland. Her body is covered in brown/black hair with little streaks of grey at her temples. Mostly seen in uniform, a grey dress with white apron. Mr. Kenson (he/him) : Big Horn Ram Kaprak. White fur with brown and black spots. Personal valet. Copper wireframe glasses. Proper black suit. Dyre Ode (he/they): When an agent of the almanac pressed this mysterious, masked figure for more information about him, they only repeated their name, as if to ensure we'd print it right, adding \"Dyre with Y but Ode as you'd like, a poem said in praise or a debt gone unpaid. It bothers me little, how you spell that name.\" Organizations The Covenant of Kaitankro: You've seen them, haven't you? The unsettlingly gregarious priests with the strange, chitinous crow masks? Of course you have, with their stilt-legs and their stilt-houses and their collection of stakes and strings and, of course, the kites. I asked one once if it was a pun: Kite and Crow, chitin crow. Something like that. The priestess told me that Kaitankro was a very real god, if a funny one, and that one day, he visited her. Like every morning, she raised each of the town's kites up to the winds in daily worship, and Kaitankro landed on the smallest one—a sight to see, she said, since her god is so large a being. And like a carnivalist, Kaitankro walked down the wire, tips of her talons, until he met the priest at the bottom. There, I was told, they whispered in the priest's ear a single phrase: \"Better to live as birds on wires than die as men in the wind.\" Chaos, it seems, breeds community, too.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for discussion of bombings, insect infestation of a human body, gun use, viscera, and threatening with a knife. For the past few months, the Blackwick County council has kept Dayward yon Vantzon-Estonbergh at arm's reach, close enough that his Aldominan wealth can filter into town, but not so close that he could risk overturning the order of things. Now, he's called in a favor, and eager to keep things even, the council has turned to the Blackwick Group to meet his needs. The problem is less \"simple\" than \"timeless\": His home is not acting the way it should. Moonlight fails to pierce the windows. The halls twist and lead him to strange places. The very decor shifts behind him. This is, it seems, a haunted house. So who better than the Blackwick Group to attend his needs? Before they can, however, they must cross the distance (which Mr. YVE has decided to place between himself and the town), and climb the hills north. They ought only hope they aren't the only travelers in the hills... This week on Sangfielle: The Secret Ledger of Roseroot Hall Pt. 1 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places Roseroot Hall : Now in the northern hills of Blackwick County, Roseroot Hall once stood mighty and imperious as a plantation house in the eastern half of the Heartland. Though the yon Vantzon-Estonbergh held it once, it fell into disrepair sometime after the panic. Details have been lost to time. Facts and Figures Lye \"Lyke\" Lychen (he/him): Tossed out of one of the many occult academies of the Unschola Republica, Lyke came to Sangfielle to continue his magical education in the most hands-on (and pockets-full) way he could. Es (she/they): A heritrix with a penchant for the finer things in life and the perilous ventures needed to earn them. Duvall (he/him): Born into one of the few human families who still have noble status in Aldomina, Duvall wasted his inheritance on a doomed adventure into Sangfielle. Now colonized by the insectoid servants of the Structure, Duvall searches to solve a question as old as people: What is \"the self\"? Tamith \"Tamm\" Callaki (they/them): An aspiring young sort, 19 or 20, who works as a courier in Blackwick, their home town. Dayward yon Vantzon-Estonbergh aka Dayward YVE (he/him) : The moneyed scion of a minor Aldominan dynasty, Dayward YVE has traveled to the Heartland as both eager-apologist and curious explorer. Sensing opportunity, he's settled in Blackwick County. Ana Berylia (she/her) : Dayward YVE's maid, a somewhat overwhelmed Carpana who has not adjusted to life in the Heartland.

In recent time, they've found that poorly armed travelers make for better prospecting.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for implied execution, description of bound people, knives, fingernails, poison/chemical weapons, hallucination caused by substance, dissociation, and descriptions of boils/infected flesh. It was a simple task: Head down into the hidden basement of the Abbey's ruins and find out what happened to neighborhood youth Janek Polyte. But instead of a dank cellar, half of the Blackwick group found their way into a living hymn, simmering under eternal noon-suns, where ashen nuns worship a goddess they once betrayed even as they tried to save her. Inside, Polyte and a Pale Magistrate who pursued him with the same vigor as the Blackwick Group (if much more virulence). Now: A deal is struck and a simple task comes to a close. But not before the rain falls, begging someone to fall with it. This week on Sangfielle: The Hymn of the Mother-Beast Pt. 4 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Places The Priory of the Mother-Beast: In the streets of Concentus, some food sellers use specially treated props to advetise their goods. The color of fruit is brighter; the loaves of bread retain softness and texture indefinitely; meat glistens. Yet by extending their beauty through time, they trade their very nature as victuals, becoming injurious copies instead. Such is the Priory. Do not confuse the soft canyon breeze or the eternal noon sun for serenity. This place is ash, held. Blackwick County: From the mines to the lake, the hills to the flats, the town once called Eastern Folly has felt a little more expansive now that it's out of the hard grip of the old curse. It's people aren't perfect, but they've made it through some dark times, and that's more than most can say. The Second Canton, aka The Pale Magistratum : The Second Canton has ordered itself around its Magistrates—holy marshals given weapons blessed by Fulmina, goddess of immediate justice, and the right to use that power as they see it. Free Seas of Kay'va, formerly the Fourth Canton : First established after Cecile Cartine's revolution over 300 years ago, today Kay'va is home to a collection of aligned communes who swear that the only way to prosperity is through the defense of equality. The Residuum: A realm of vibrant color, where the things of the world go when their time in the material world fades away. A plane of death, but rendered in glorious light. Facts and Figures Sister Marisha (she/her): For decades, the human called Marisha served as the representative of the Boundless Conclave in Eastern Follow and as the only apparent follower of the old Cult of the Mother-Beast. Eager to guide, and quick to reprimand, she gained a reputation as a well meaning hard ass in the mining town. Now she finds herself adjusting to life inside this secret priory of salt, ash, and ceramic. Akule \"Janek\" Polyte (he/him): A Drakkan member of Blackwick County's youth community, a member of the group who went beneath the Abbey's ruins a year ago, and if his equipment is anything to go by, an undercover agent of the Free Seas of Kay'va. Ezek Semm (he/him): An up-and-coming Pale Magistrate, whose devotion to Fulmina, goddess of instant justice, is not to be questioned. It is, however, concomitant with his desire for glory. The Shape: Are the trains that run across the Heartland bound to the Structure, or do they direct it? Is the overlap between the two even real at all, or might two machinic forces be at work here in Sangfielle? Organizations The Telluricist Union: Made up by a mix of peoples driven to the hills by Aldomina, this group of knife sharpeners, herbalists, geologists, and all around investigators have made it their job to keep their old wisdom and see it used to help those in need. The best among them are called Keen. The Shape Knights : It took people with clear minds, great ingenuity, and implacable spirit to face down and defeat one of the living trains of Sangfielle. In the time since, they've crafted armor from their slain foe, and with that have come to be experts of all things train. They herd, they breach, they redirect. But they haven't yet killed a second.

Ephemera A hymn found in the notes of Janek Polyte Her love is vast and nourishing. Her glory does astound. Thus in sin we're flourishing, Tis sin to which we're bound. With words we weave her love and ours, And with our voices breathe: A halt to death, a halt to stars, A halt to what will be. But listen, Mother-Beast, please know: Tis love by which we've wrought A world in which you're split in woe, Instead of merely nought Your love is vast and flourishing. Your glory does astound.

One year after the people of Blackwick County (then Eastern Folly) broke a curse that had plagued the town for generations, a group of strange and determined professionals arrived. Explorers, investigators, wardens of nature and culture and everything in between. They'd come to answer the call for folks just like them, people who could ensure the town wouldn't fall under the sway of any other supernatural threat. And just a few days after they arrived, they got their first job. Janek Polyte, one of the town youths who wandered down underneath the Abbey a year ago and found the egg sac (which now rests nestled and pulsating near the mine's entry), has gone missing. And witnesses place him at the Abbey's underground entrance before he vanished. And so, the Blackwick Group heads off to their first job. Explore the under-ruins of the Abbey, locate the missing Drakkan kid, and figure out what in the name of the heartland is going on down there to begin with... This week on Sangfielle: The Hymn of the Mother-Beast Pt. 1 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Peoples Caprak (cap-ROK): The goat folks of the northlands, where they put up with dust, ash, snow, and the unilateral \"justice\" of the Pale Magistratum. Carpana (car - pahn - a) : They're little folks, three to four feet tall or so. A little like capybara, I suppose. Devils : Once, they were contained by (and made to administer) some vast network of hells. But they fought their way out, took over Aldomina, and nurtured a fledgling empire into an expansive one. Drakkan (drah-KAHN): I've always thought we look like seahorses. Skin pulled across spiny, exo-skeletal armor. Bright colors. Good looking. Heritrixes (hare-uh-trixes) : Heritrixes are immaterial beings, sometimes confused for ghosts, demons, or other sorts of supernatural spirits, who enter into contracts with physical hosts. Human: A smooth-skinned, hornless type of person, mostly found in the Heartland and in the Unschola Republica these days. Unremarkable. \"Except in variety,\" you'll often hear a human say, revealing only that they're more prideful than wise. Ojantani: The Ojantani, who share traits with buffalo and water oxen, are as often melancholic or timorous as they are the loud, stereotypical minotaur sort. Places Blackwick County: From the mines to the lake, the hills to the flats, the town once called Eastern Folly has felt a little more expansive now that it's out of the hard grip of the old curse. It's people aren't perfect, but they've made it through some dark times, and that's more than most can say. Aldomina (al-doh-mee-nah): What once stood as the name of the whole continent is now only the name of the Confederation that runs across the eastern half of the territory surrounding the Sangfielle, currently constituted by three sub-states called Cantons. The First Canton, aka the Throne of Dominion: Once a fledgling human empire but nearly 1900 years ago, a minor duke of some great hell led an effort to take it over. And once they did, they pushed what was an already spreading empire even further in that direction. The Second Canton, aka The Pale Magistratum (ma-juh-strah-tuhm) : The Second Canton has ordered itself around its Magistrates—holy marshals given weapons blessed by Fulmina, goddess of immediate justice, and the right to use that power as they see it. Unschola Republica, formerly the Third Canton (oon-skoh-la): For a millenia, the alchemists, mage-practitioners, and cryptotheological scholars of the Third Canton complained in secret about the leash kept on them by Aldomina's distant leaders. They've since slipped that leash, and whether that's for better or worse, time will tell. Free Seas of Kay'va, formerly the Fourth Canton (kai-vah) : First established after Cecile Cartine's revolution over 300 years ago, today Kay'va is home to a collection of aligned communes who swear that the only way to prosperity is through the defense of equality. The Fifth Canton, the Protectorate Kingdom of Ojantan (oh-JAHN-tahn): Ojantan was once a kingdom to rival Aldomina, and a solid place to live to boot, if a little over-structured for my taste. But the Devils got to the nation's leaders, and now it's been reduced to another Canton in the Empress' collection. Sangfielle, the Heartland: Once, it was a breadbasket for the whole Dominion, now this is territory haunted twice: first by a bloody, buried past, and second by an uncanny, indifferent future. Concentus, the Ringed City (kun-CHEN-tus): A vast ringed city surrounding (and containing) Sangfielle. Covered in magical wards, filled with those eager to delve into the heartland or to push back its most fearsome creatures. The gaslit city of Concentus is now the most technologically advanced metropolis of the continent. The Residuum: A realm of vibrant color, where the things of the world go when their time in the material world fades away. A plane of death, but rendered in glorious light. Facts and Figures Janek Polyte (he/him): A Drakkan member of Blackwick County's youth community, and a member of the group who went beneath the Abbey's ruins a year ago. Quiet in public, and little kept in his humble home. Proctor Ekashi Wolff (he/him): A leading member of the Triadic Pyre in Blackwick County, whose heritage and faith have led him to close communion with the Arinpata, the Ojantani \"Smiling God of Death,\" who also serves as the Triadic Pyre's God of Ashen Remains. Ekashi is an Ojantani himself, but was born and raised here in Blackwick, and has spent his life trying to keep it safe and stable. Though if you ask me, I have to wonder if he really cares about Blackwich, or if he just sees it as a place of sturdy form that can usher the world into fire peacefully. The Shape: Are the trains that run across the Heartland bound to the Structure, or do they direct it? Is the overlap between the two even real at all, or might two machinic forces be at work here in Sangfielle? Arinpata (they/them): A slim being of joyous countenance and many heights, whose painted face guides souls to the Residuum. Or so they say. Organizations The Disciples of the Triadic Pyre: Appropriately devoted to a trio of gods, the Triadic Pyre believe that entropy is the only certain thing in this world, and as such aim to master it. Recently began to mark workers willing to do their tasks in the mines with their brand. The Telluricist Union: Made up by a mix of peoples driven to the hills by Aldomina, this group of knife sharpeners, herbalists, geologists, and all around investigators have made it their job to keep their old wisdom and see it used to help those in need. The best among them are called Keen. The Shape Knights : It took people with clear minds, great ingenuity, and implacable spirit to face down and defeat one of the living trains of Sangfielle. In the time since, they've crafted armor from their slain foe, and with that have come to be experts of all things train. They herd, they breach, they redirect. But they haven't yet killed a second.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for discussion of knives, possession, insect infestation of a living person, death, animal slaughter, being buried alive, and drowning. It has been one year since the folks of Eastern Folly put an end to a generations-long curse, and a few months fewer since a vote brought a new name to the town and its environs: Blackwick County. The name was a compromise, evoking not only the darkening embers of the Triadic Pyre's ashen dogma, but also the warmth and comfort of night at home coming to its end with a little prayer to Slumbous. Name ain't the only changed in that town, though. As the days went on, and the understanding that the curse had been broken was felt more firmly, it seemed as both miners and townsfolk let themselves dream of further futures than they had before. Some folks settled down to start families, others sent word for friends and relatives to move to this newly prosperous burg. New business sprung up, and not all of them made it through the year, sure, but more than you'd think. This was a community that was only just now starting to know itself. The sort of town you heard about and thought was made up. A place really, truly, on the upswing. Even the trains seemed to be reliable, more or less. But the powers that be, so to speak, they knew better than to rest on laurels, no matter whose they were. I mean… Skeletal emissaries. Miners going deeper into the mountain. Sounds below the abbey. The damned egg. Can you blame them for putting out the call? Can you blame them for bringing together the Blackwick Group? This week on Sangfielle: The Blackwick Group The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Peoples Caprak (cap-ROK): The goat folks of the northlands, where they put up with dust, ash, snow, and the unilateral \"justice\" of the Pale Magistratum. Carpana (car - pahn - a) : They're little folks, three to four feet tall or so. A little like capybara, I suppose. Devils : Once, they were contained by (and made to administer) some vast network of hells. But they fought their way out, took over Aldomina, and nurtured a fledgling empire into an expansive one. Drakkan (drah-KAHN): I've always thought we look like seahorses. Skin pulled across spiny, exo-skeletal armor. Bright colors. Good looking. Heritrixes (hare-uh-trixes) : Heritrixes are immaterial beings, sometimes confused for ghosts, demons, or other sorts of supernatural spirits, who enter into contracts with physical hosts. Human: A smooth-skinned, hornless type of person, mostly found in the Heartland and in the Unschola Republica these days. Unremarkable. \"Except in variety,\" you'll often hear a human say, revealing only that they're more prideful than wise. Ojantani: The Ojantani, who share traits with buffalo and water oxen, are as often melancholic or timorous as they are the loud, stereotypical minotaur sort. Places Blackwick County: From the mines to the lake, the hills to the flats, the town once called Eastern Folly has felt a little more expansive now that it's out of the hard grip of the old curse. It's people aren't perfect, but they've made it through some dark times, and that's more than most can say. The Sleeping City: Every 13 years, a metropolis wakes with the buzzing sound of life. Do not cross its borders uninvited, especially not when it and its inhabitants are at rest. Facts and Figures The Course: There is debate about the true nature of the Heartland's Truth, the power that turned Sangfielle into what it is today . But the Cleavers call it the Course. Part river, part lesson, part direction traveled. Entirely beyond the grasp of mortal minds. The Structure: Reason, logic, sense. The world is, fundamentally, a place that fits together and functions. We may not like that, say the adherents of the structure. And sometimes, the world may move in ways beyond our particular ken. But there is something holding it together, and that , they say, is the Heartland's Truth: The Structure. The Shape: Are the trains that run across the Heartland bound to the Structure, or do they direct it? Is the overlap between the two even real at all, or might two machinic forces be at work here in Sangfielle?. Es (she/they): A heritrix with a penchant for the finer things in life and the perilous ventures needed to earn them. Virtue Mondegreen (she/her): Virtue was supposed to have been killed in the great vampiric purge, years before the panic. But it's like I said before, Sangfielle was strange long before the Devils noticed it. Marn Ancura (she/her): Recently raised to Keen status inside of the Telluricist Union, Marn's en route to Blackwick with aims to help folks the best she can (and solve one of the great medical mysteries of the heartland). Chine (he/they): The only member of the Blackwick Group to be born in Eastern Folly, Chine was called out to by the truth of the heartland. Duvall (he/him): Born into one of the few human families who still have noble status in Aldomina, Duvall wasted his inheritance on a doomed adventure into Sangfielle. Now colonized by the insectoid servants of the Structure, Duvall searches to solve a question as old as people: What is \"the self\"? Pickman (she/her) : Fifteen years. That's how long Pickman spent on the train. After being rescued by a Shape Knight, she found herself compelled to take up the armor and join their cause—a reaction that puts her in good company, as many other knights did just the same. Lye \"Lyke\" Lychen (he/him): Tossed out of one of the many occult academies of the Unschola Republica, Lyke came to Sangfielle to continue his magical education in the most hands-on (and pockets-full) way he could. Organizations The Boundless Conclave: Less of an individual church, more of an association between hundreds of independent faiths. Small sects, nearly forgotten cults, and unjealous gods make up this vast pantheon. The Disciples of the Triadic Pyre: Appropriately devoted to a trio of gods, the Triadic Pyre believe that entropy is the only certain thing in this world, and as such aim to master it. Recently began to mark workers willing to do their tasks in the mines with their brand. The Telluricist Union: Made up by a mix of peoples driven to the hills by Aldomina, this group of knife sharpeners, herbalists, geologists, and all around investigators have made it their job to keep their old wisdom and see it used to help those in need.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for human death, teeth, knives, possession, human branding One day of strange occurrences is, in some ways, a blessing . Good dinner time conversation. The stuff of campfire stories. Two ill-fated days? That's a warning and a courtesy. The troubled cough that precedes illness. An opportunity for you to prepare for worse. But three cursed days in a row? That's where you really have to worry, because it ain't just one thing. Three cursed days in a row is as often the end to a little township as it is the sign of a great dynasty's rise. With one or two, you've got a hex, maybe some begrudged witch or local spirit who wasn't paid its due. With three, you've got a blank page. And from writer to reader, let me tell you: Ain't nothing scarier than that. This week on Sangfielle: The Cursed of Eastern Folly Pt. 3 The Almanac of the Heartland Rider Peoples The Tooth Trolls: Every year, right around harvest time, the trolls climb up out from the lake and do their gardening by the shoreline. Every few years, some strapping and brash showoff goes \"to show them who really owns this land.\" Only thing is, they find out they had the answer wrong. Don't pay 'em no mind, and you'll be fine. The Lake Skeletons: What is there to know, as of yet. Rivalrous. Boisterous. See right through 'em. Places The Waterlogged Kingdom: At least that's what we're calling it for now. Deep under the water, an empress waits. There's been debate: Did they turn the wood from her sunken ship into a palace for her? Build castles out of the lake sand? Maybe they never stopped marching, and they're down there right now, just going round in circles. An likely area of inquiry, for certain Facts and Figures The Sunken Empress Altapasqua (she/her): Around fifty years after the panic set in, Altapasqua told her people she would ride across this cursed land and purge it of its disease and danger. She only made it about three fourths of the way. And well, it's as expected. She was down there ever since. Slumbous (any): A minor god of the Boundless Conclave, who is associated with the ritual practice of putting one's candles out at night, but whose domains extend beyond that to include the more general realm of routines of care and rituals of restfulness. Often depicted in a big, crooked hat. Snuffos (he/him): An even more minor god recognized by the Boundless Conclave, who decides whether to put out candles that tired people forget to snuff out before bed themselves. A petty god in more ways than one. Marisha (she/her): The previous attendant of the small Boundless Conclave temple in town. A caprak woman in her 50s, and a quiet fixture to the town. Stanislaka (she/they): Marisha's replacement, the new attendant of the Boundless Conclave temple, an young ojantani whose faith to Slumbous knows no bounds. Organizations The Boundless Conclave: Less of an individual church, more of an association between hundreds of independent faiths. Small sects, nearly forgotten cults, and unjealous gods make up this vast pantheon. The Disciples of the Triadic Pyre: Appropriately devoted to a trio of gods, the Triadic Pyre believe that entropy is the only certain thing in this world, and as such aim to master it.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for human death, discussion of cannibalism, the death of animals, knives, and knifework. The suns rise on Eastern Folly as another day begins. High in the trees, the fruit grows ever so slightly riper. And as the fruit grows larger and warmer in color, so too do the spirits of the people of the town. Miners haul back their finds with a grin, eager to flip this ironing board or that collection of ancient coins to whichever consignment shop or heartland broker makes the best deal. Main street shopkeeps give their customers an extra 5% off—a friends and family discount, they say, and ain't we all friends and family here? Fishers wave to their families as their boats come in, blessed by afternoon light. Except the light… the light is touched so, today. A shade of green, not yet sickly but pale and concerning. And under the abbey, it moves. This week on Sangfielle: The Curse of Eastern Folly Pt. 2 The Alamanac of the Heartland Rider Peoples Caprak (cap-ROK): The goat folks of the northlands, where they put up with dust, ash, snow, and the unilateral \"justice\" of the Pale Magistratum. Carpana (car - pahn - a) : They're little folks, three to four feet tall or so. A little like capybara, I suppose. Devils : Once, they were contained by (and made to administer) some vast network of hells. But they fought their way out, took over Aldomina, and nurtured a fledgling empire into an expansive one. Drakkan (drah-KAHN): I've always thought we look like seahorses. Skin pulled across spiny, exo-skeletal armor. Bright colors. Good looking. Heritrixes (hare-uh-trixes) : Heritrixes are immaterial beings, sometimes confused for ghosts, demons, or other sorts of supernatural spirits, who enter into contracts with physical hosts. Human: A smooth-skinned, hornless type of person, mostly found in the Heartland and in the Unschola Republica these days. Unremarkable. \"Except in variety,\" you'll often hear a human say, revealing only that they're more prideful than wise. Ojantani: The Ojantani, who share traits with buffalo and water oxen, are as often melancholic or timorous as they are the loud, stereotypical minotaur sort. Places ALDOMINA (al-doh-mee-nah): What once stood as the name of the whole continent is now only the name of the Confederation that runs across the eastern half of the territory surrounding the Sangfielle, currently constituted by three sub-states called Cantons. The First Canton, aka the Throne of Dominion: Once a fledgling human empire but nearly 1900 years ago, a minor duke of some great hell led an effort to take it over. And once they did, they pushed what was an already spreading empire even further in that direction. The Second Canton, aka The Pale Magistratum (ma-juh-strah-tuhm) : The Second Canton has ordered itself around its Magistrates—holy marshals given weapons blessed by Fulmina, goddess of immediate justice, and the right to use that power as they see it. Unschola Republica, formerly the Third Canton (oon-skoh-la): For a millenia, the alchemists, mage-practitioners, and cryptotheological scholars of the Third Canton complained in secret about the leash kept on them by Aldomina's distant leaders. They've since slipped that leash, and whether that's for better or worse, time will tell. Free Seas of Kay'va, formerly the Fourth Canton (kai-vah) : First established after Cecile Cartine's revolution over 300 years ago, today Kay'va is home to a collection of aligned communes who swear that the only way to prosperity is through the defense of equality. The Fifth Canton, the Protectorate Kingdom of Ojantan (oh-JAHN-tahn): Ojantan was once a kingdom to rival Aldomina, and a solid place to live to boot, if a little over-structured for my taste. But the Devils got to the nation's leaders, and now it's been reduced to another Canton in the Empress' collection. Sangfielle, the Heartland: Once, it was a breadbasket for the whole Dominion, now this is territory haunted twice: first by a bloody, buried past, and second by an uncanny, indifferent future. Concentus, the Ringed City (kun-CHEN-tus): A vast ringed city surrounding (and containing) Sangfielle. Covered in magical wards, filled with those eager to delve into the heartland or to push back its most fearsome creatures. The gaslit city of Concentus is now the most technologically advanced metropolis of the continent. Eastern Folly: A little mining town, touched by the heartland's truth. Facts and Figures The Harvest Festival: A yearly celebration of the fruit harvest in Eastern Folly, marked by folk plays, parades, and music. It nears... Janek Polyte: Among the group of 20-somethings who went down into the strange 'basement' of the old Abbey, Janek is the one who found himself pulled most closely to sights beyond… and to the cursed object they found on the altar. Organizations The Telluricist Union : When Aldomina expanded its empire into the heartland, it did so with conquest in mind and weapons in hand. They faced resistance of course. The peoples who'd lived here—people who today we'd call Carpana, Ojantani, Drakkan, and many others besides—had done so for thousands of years even before the Devils had escaped hell, and they weren't eager to see their ways of life destroyed. Nevertheless, they lost that fight. Many were killed directly, others enslaved, and some driven to barren lands in the hills, mountains, and wastes. The Telluricist Union comes from a group of the latter. A group of survivors, largely though not entirely Carpana, pulled together to survivor against all odds, combining know-how from this nation and that tribe, and developing new techniques and tools to make a hard life a little more livable. They sharpened knives, they aided the ill, they made elegantly simple machines, they studied the world around them. And then the Panic hit, the truth of the Heartland became increasingly loud. They lost folks in the chaos. But in the end, that only tempered their will to survive and maintain. The Telluricist Union, and the ones they call the Keen, were formed thereafter. Something like 300 members at any given time. People dedicated not only to keeping that old wisdom around, but to see it used to help folks in need. The Boundless Conclave: Less of an individual church, more of an association between hundreds of independent faiths. Small sects, nearly forgotten cults, and unjealous gods make up this vast pantheon. The Caravan of the Coin: Cursed by Ribbadon, Frog God of Wealth, these traveling merchant-clerics never arrive at a destination carrying what they expect. The Disciples of the Triadic Pyre: Appropriately devoted to a trio of gods, the Triadic Pyre believe that entropy is the only certain thing in this world, and as such aim to master it.

      "description": "This episode carries content warnings for discussion of death and an allusion to drowning. Welcome to Sangfielle . This episode marks not only the beginning of a new season for us, but a whole new world. For the last six years, our main series campaigns have mostly taken part in one of two worlds, even though they sometimes have huge time jumps and setting resets in them. So, if you're just jumping on, this is a pretty good place to do it. You'll be along for the ride with everyone else, with no old continuity to worry about. New characters, new places, new world. So, what is this world? What is Sangfielle? Well, the big picture is what I say in this episode's intro: Once, this was the agriculutural heartland of a vast empire which had slowly conquered this continent. Then, about 200 years ago, things started changing, and what was already a somewhat magical world became cursed and increasingly detatched from \"reality.\" Now it's a sort of re-frontier, with touches of dark fantasy, a bit of gothic and cosmic horror, some weird west and southern gothic flair, and a little bit of general mystery on top for good measure. That's all you really need to know. Yes, there is a history to this continent, one of imperial devils, slave revolts, unchained magical scholars, black-clad magistrates... it goes on and on. And all of that is fine and good, and you can read a bit about it below and hear us talk about it towards the start of the episode. But none of it really matters . Think of the big lore dump as a bonus, but there won't be a pop quiz or a test. What matters is what's in front of us. And what's in front of us is a strange little mining town in the northern hills. And today, using The Ground Itself by Everest Pipkin , we're going to learn about that town. And in just a few weeks, we'll use this little town as a home base (or a \"Haven\" in the nomenclature of Heart: The City Beneath by Grant Howitt and Christopher Taylor ) for all sorts of adventure. Before we get there, though, we start here, with a patch of land, some caves, and time. This week on Sangfielle: The Curse of Eastern Folly Pt. 1 The Alamanac of the Heartland Rider Peoples Caprak (cap-ROK): The goat folks of the north put up with a lot. Dust, ash, snow. Rocky mountains with very little arable soil. They made it work, but it was the fear of all the ways it might fail that led to the Magistratum. Carpana (car - pahn - a) : Back before Aldomnia strode across Sangfielle, the Carpana were one of the many peoples who lived here. They're little folks, three to four feet tall or so. A little like capybara, I suppose. They used to make their homes in the trees, well, not the trees per se, but in villages built on and between the branches of the lake-side forests across the heartland. Seemed like it was a good life. Lots of fruit, maybe some fish from the lakes? Little communities of 30 or 40. Anyway, then Aldomina came in, pushed them and so many others to the most barren parts of the mountains. After the panic, some moved back to their homes, but others had found new ways to live. That's how it goes. Devils : It's hard to speak to devils writ large , since the only devils I've ever met are those from Aldomina, and maybe those still in hell are different. But of those I've met, I've happened across two distinct varieties. The first are those who come from the Throne of Dominion itself, and they're haughty bastards always searching for a new way to demean you. The second are those who, when the panic hit, got left behind. What must it be like, I wonder, when your \"grand civilization\" reveals that you're no different than the rest of the muck it left to die? It ain't as bad as what we went through, that's for sure, but still, you meet the devils (and their descendents) that call the heartland home, and you can tell they carry that betrayal on them like a mark. Drakkan (drah-KAHN): They say we descended from the legendary dragons from some more wondrous age, but I don't know that I buy it. I've always thought we look like seahorses. Skin pulled across spiny, exo-skeletal armor. Many of us spent generations enslaved by Aldomina, who put us to work across Sangfielle, only to be left to its devices when the panic set in. Thankfully, in the southwest, we've taken a home for ourselves, and one day, once the almanac is complete, I hope to make it back there. Heritrixes (hare-uh-trixes) : Heritrixes are immaterial beings, sometimes confused for ghosts, demons, or other sorts of supernatural spirits, who enter into contracts with physical hosts. In exchange for their expertise and magical power, Heritrixes are allowed to take control of the host's body for an agreed upon period of time, giving them a way to experience the material world. I'd say that I wouldn't sign an agreement like that, but who's to know? Human: A smooth-skinned, hornless type of person, mostly found in the Heartland and in the Unschola Republica these days. Unremarkable. \"Except in variety,\" you'll often hear a human say, revealing only that they're more prideful than wise. Ojantani: Bigness doesn't always mean boisterousness. The Ojantani, who share traits with buffalo and water oxen the way I do with the colorful seahorses of the Kay'van seas, are as often melancholic or timorous as they are the loud, stereotypical minotaur sort. If there is a cultural trait among the Ojantani I've been fortunate enough to ride with, it's that they are always interested in how things fit together, and in whether or not something (or someone) has found its proper place—met with dignity and value—in this world. Places ALDOMINA (al-doh-mee-nah): What once stood as the name of the whole continent is now only the name of the Confederation that runs across the eastern half of the territory surrounding the Sangfielle, currently constituted by three sub-states called Cantons. The First Canton, aka the Throne of Dominion: Once a fledgling human empire but nearly 1900 years ago, a minor duke of some great hell led an effort to take it over. Who can blame them, the hells seem like a bad place to be. So, they took this once human empire over through a combination of bargaining, subterfuge, and force. And once they did it, and pushed what was an already spreading empire even further in that direction. The Second Canton, aka The Pale Magistratum (ma-juh-strah-tuhm) : If Aldomina has a superego, it is the Pale Magistratum. Though its populace now lives in dense cities, the first settlers of the ash-and-snow covered Second Canton led hardscrabble lives. In order to enforce rationing and harshly punish anyone who directly or indirectly harmed a member of a settlement, the culture ordered itself around its Magistrates—holy marshals given weapons blessed by Fulmina, goddess of immediate justice, and the right to use that power as they see fit. Today, these Magistrates exist in a complex hierarchy, but even the lowest ranking members of the order are fearsome arbiters of what they perceive as justice. Unschola Republica, formerly the Third Canton (oon-skoh-la): For a millenia, the alchemists, mage-practitioners, and cryptotheological scholars of the Third Canton complained in secret about the leash kept on them by Aldomina's distant leaders. In their towering universities, they taught approved curricula but hid their most occult research, biding their time for a day they could split away from the confederation. And when the Drakkan revolted, they found their opportunity, using the Kay'van uprising as a cover for their own split. Can't blame them for that, but I'll always remember that it was opportunity, and not morality, that led them to side with us. Free Seas of Kay'va, formerly the Fourth Canton (kai-vah) : Kay'va means \"Our House,\" and there could be no better name for my homeland. We call it \"The Free Seas,\" but it's actually a free association of communes, which we first established after our revolt over 300 years ago. Led by rebel slave and autodidact Cecile Cartine—founder of the worker-collectivist ideology which came to be known as Cartinism—not only did we managed to establish autonomy, but we also shook the very foundations of a damn near millennia old empire in the process. When it came time to build Concentus, the ringed city, I suppose we wanted to prove that it could do just as well, if not better, than any of the other nations of the continent. Which is probably why our chunk of the city is so often decorated with the flag of the revolution: a blue field, with golden sextant and machete connecting the waves to the stars. The Fifth Canton, the Protectorate Kingdom of Ojantan (oh-JAHN-tahn): The most recent Canton of Aldomina, added only around 350 years ago, just a generation before the Kay'van revolt. Previous to that, Ojantan was its own rival kingdom, stretching across the southern half of the continent. Because of being so recently conquered, the Ojantani dragged their feet and sabotaged efforts to move forces through their land towards Kay'va strongholds, contributing to the success of the revolution. In the old days, Ojantani was a solid place to live. Each person—even the living embodiments of their god folk—found their place in a grand social diagram. Unfortunately, sounds like some folks wanted to draw that diagram a little different. Sangfielle, the Heartland: Fought over for centuries, Aldomina rose to prominence millenia ago when it finally conquered this fertile land. A breadbasket for the whole Dominion, each canton once had part of the territory (though the Throne kept most of it for itself). This is territory haunted twice: first by a bloody, buried past, and second by an uncanny, indifferent future. Many fled, but many more did not have that luxury. Today, two centuries later, the heartland has become a re-frontier , a home to survivors clinging to each other and to those explorers, occultists, technologists, and devotees of the strange, called to this land of ash, metal, and ichor. Concentus, the Ringed City (kun-CHEN-tus): When the panic set in, the five great states responded in kind. For the first time since the Kay'van revolution, delegates from each power met and agreed that something must be done to contain the ill wind sweeping across the once verdant country. And so, Concentus was built as a collaboration. A vast ringed city, covered in magical wards, filled with those eager to delve into the heartland or to push back its most fearsome creatures. Because of relics and inventions recovered from the depths of the heartland, the gaslit city of Concentus is now the most technologically advanced metropolis of the continent. And yet, each moonrise feels like it may be the last... Eastern Folly: A little mining town, touched by the heartland's truth. Facts and Figures The Empress Altapasqua: Around fifty years after the panic set in, Altapasqua told her people she would ride across this cursed land and purge it of its disease and danger. She only made it about three fourths of the way. The Panic: People from the Cantons, people who didn't live here already, like to think that this all started about 200 years ago, but that's really just when the panic set in. First they noticed the soil had turned. Then it was the water. Then it was the dead walking, the ground slipping away. Then they got afraid. They call it \"the panic,\" I think because it's easier to swallow than facing it head on and calling it what it is: \"The Truth.\" Organizations The Boundless Conclave: Spread across the heartland, this religion is a (some say cynical) collection of hundreds of other faiths. Small sects, nearly forgotten cults, and unjealous gods make up this vast pantheon. As a lay member, you are allowed to use the facilities of any associated place of worship. As practicing clergy, joining the Conclave costs you some percentage of your tithe, but joins you to a network of other practitioners, places your god among the exalted many, and guarantees you at least some parishioners. In some ways, to join the Conclave is to make a bet: At least some of this stuff must be real, right? May as well throw in with everyone else and make the best of it. The Caravan of the Coin: It goes like this: Once, a pair of brothers wanted an ox, and so they did what they were told never to do. They made a deal with Ribbadon, the great Frog God of Wealth . \"Give us a silver coin,\" they said, and he did, on the condition that they return the coin that year, or else owe it and its double the next year, and so on, forever. Well, they bought the ox, and with that ox they bought a pair more, and soon they appeared quite rich. I write \"appeared\" because, in fact, they were deeply indebted to old Ribbadon. As the two grew in age and worry, they sought to make good on their debt, but there was one problem: They had, of course, spent that silver coin many decades ago, so they were at a loss. Until, they realized, with all their wealth, they could forge a coin like the one they were given, and fool the old frog. Wheelbarrows filled with silver and gold were led to Ribbadon's court, and in a single swipe of his tongue, he swallowed years of profit in an instant, and then bellowed his judgment. \"You have paid me back one more coin than you owe me, yet one less than you took.\" The brothers knew instantly that their deception had been for naught, but before they could object, a curse descended. \"There is no fortune too rich in taste for my tongue, and until I have my coin, on your tongues will be the only way to hold your fortune.\" When the brothers, their kin, their descendents, and even their servants returned home, they found that anything they'd carried with them had been turned into something else of the same weight. Gold coins turned lead. Prayer books transformed into straw. A rock to a diamond. This is why you see those caravans now, hauling mysterious cargo across the grasslands and deserts of the heartland. They're trading whatever it is they can, forever, in doomed worship of Ribbadon. Paying down interest. And looking for that old coin. They'll tell you that the lesson is that you cannot stop change, and so you must lean in to the chaos. Let yourself and everything you have be changed by curse of the heartland. And they'll demonstrate their new mastery over magics alchemical, illusionary, and alterative as proof of their philosophy's power. And yet… sometimes they'll tell you nothing at all, the hypocrites, because in their mouths they carry cargo they are desperate to keep. It is as old Ribbadon implied: Whatever they hold on their tongues is kept from the curse. The Disciples of the Triadic Pyre: I'll say as little as I can because there are few words one can write about them that won't guide them to you like a beacon, marking the ink, page, and writer to be burnt as fuel. The disciples worship a trio of gods that they call the Triadic Pyre, but it is hard to understand how these three beings—powerful though they may be—came first into alignment with each other. From the Magistrates of the Second Canton, they took Fulmina , goddess of immediate justice, and appointed her ruler of the Flame's Spark . From the terrible hierarchies of the locomotive Shape that runs across the heartland, they found a burning god among iron trains , whose name my lips dare not utter lest it lay its tracks towards you and I both, and aligned that beast with the Fire Alight . And finally, whether as cruel corruption or in a moment of lightness, they adopted the Ojantani Arinpata, the Smiling God of Death as their deity of Ashen Remains . Under it all is a simple belief: Even in the heartland where things sometimes find second or third life, in the end, everything burns, everything dies, everything ceases to be. And for the Disciples, the best place to be is holding the match.

      "description": "People will tell you that the heartland got sick about 200 years ago. When the dust came, reality left, and the panic set in. But trust me, it was ailing long before that. Don't get me wrong, you could understand why someone would die for it in the old days. Greens and golds, bread and honey. But around the time that those well dressed devils of Aldomina swept in, five, six hundred years ago, that's when things started to turn. They wanted to fence it in. Rows of corn and cane, columns of people. Nations reduced to gardens. Is it any wonder the ground itself started to ache? No one noticed until about 200 years ago, of course. See, the truth of the heartland—the truth of the world—is that it cannot be fenced in. So, the storms came, and they brought a deep sickness to the plains and valleys. Soil turned barren, animals twisted in form and character, unkind spirits swept through the fields, farmhouses, and burgs. Reality, unhinged, drew its own course. Unpredictable, though never dishonest. And as if in response, a rigid, mechanical malediction arrived, delivered by the cursed railway called the Shape. To be near places touched by such fearsome Structure was to hear a drum played too on beat, to see a circle drawn so smoothly as to make you stumble from its perfect curve. Those who could, those who held the whips and pocketbooks, fled. Those left behind tried to find stability, tried to make a home on this re-frontier of ash, metal, and ichor. Aldomina called this territory San Fielle. But there ain't nothin saintly this bout place. Now, we used the name that our ancestors, those forced to work this land or force from it, called it under their breath: Sangfielle . The Bloodfields.

      "description": "\"Why do we travel the Prophet's Path? This is a question raised yearly at this time, as we prepare for our Pilgrimage. Today, a year before the Millennial Celebration, which risks overshadowing the true answer with the spectacle of anniversary, I want to give as direct and clear an answer as I can imagine. When we trace the path that Logos Kantel traveled when they first came to this moon, we retell the story of their arrival, of their miracle working, and of their devotion to progression —the determination to move beyond the draw of conquest. Now, you might say, 'Gur Sevraq, don't we retell the stories of the prophet during nearly every service?' And we do, we do. But a story is not a simple thing. A story can change. It will shape itself around the way we tell it, or when we do. The room a story is told in seeps into the facts of the matter. The voice of the speaker, like the line of an artist, gives form to ambiguity. And, worse, there is no pure retelling. No single great orator who might be able to capture the truth, no metaphor incapable of losing its power, no choir whose songs can always, eternally lift us… or ground us, as need be. Nothing shapes a story more than the world we are in. It can twist meaning away from us, transport us into a world of stretched mirrors and garbled echoes. And that is why we return to the Path. Whether we walk or ride across the sands, when we travel the route that the Prophet did, we do so as a stylus into clay. We know the world writes on us. And so every year, we gather so that we might write back on it .\" An Excerpt from a Sermon by Gur Sevraq, leader of the Church of the Resin Hart, circa 1422 This week on PARTIZAN: Operation Shackled Sun: Act 3: The Stories Told About the Things We Do ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Curtain of Divinity : Though Kesh is technically governed through an elaborate parliamentary democracy, the truth is that The Curtain of Divinity, a secretive organization inside of the Stel (and with agents across all of the Principality), serves as the actual power behind the throne. Knowledge of the Curtain is carefully guarded, and its membership is even further protected. Currently, the Curtain is most firmly aligned with Kesh and Nideo, and fights in an open war against the Pact of Necessary Venture and Millennium Break. The Pact of Necessary Venture : Though they trace their lineage back to an exploratory committee founded in the late 14th century of the Perfect Millenium, the Pact was not made in earnest until five years ago in 1418 PM, soon after hostilities began between Kesh and Apostolos. Currently, the Pact has finds its greatest support from members of Columnar and Apostolos. They are in a state of open conflict against the Curtain and Millennium Break. Millennium Break: Dissidents, idealogues, rebels, and mercenaries. Even now, they agree on little, except this: It is time for a new Millennium. GLORY: With the help of advanced Columnar cloning science, the Glory Project (or simply GLORY), claims to have resurrected (and made immortal) heroes of the nation's past called Eidolons. On Partizan, they field Kleos, Apothesa, Vervain, and the squad's leader: Laurel, elect of Motion. Company of the Spade: A veteran mercenary unit founded by space miners who learned how to pilot Hollows in the most dangerous of settings. They've been brought to Partizan to combine both types of expertise. //People\\\\ The Witch in Glass (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the body of the Divine Past. Now scours Partizan for the lost, injured, and unsure, recruiting them into her growing city-state. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. Haunted by an old foe. Gur Sevraq (he/them): Once the Leader of the Church of the Resin Heart, now a discontinuous prophet: One self welded to the consciousness of their greatest living rival, the other a representative of everything he once opposed. Once controlled the Divine Future, but that was lost to Stel Nideo after his great fall. Kleos (they/them): Skin is fully like a shiny maroon. Bright red cloak wrapped around neck and hanging back like a cape, totally topless otherwise. Khaki army pant capris, a spear slung over their back, and a heavy sidearm at their waist. Pilots the Epoche. Gucci Garantine (she/her) : Defector from Stel Kesh, controller of House Brightline and HORIZON's efforts on Partizan. Now a powerful member of Millennium Break's political class, heading the Party of the Masque. //Places\\\\ Girandole: The massive gas giant around which Partizan orbits. Deep within its gaseous storms rests a secret Portcullis which leads towards the space sector containing the Nobel homeworld and Autonomy Itself. The Reflecting Pool: The city that has emerged inside of the Divine Past's body, led by the Witch in Glass. Its citizens come from every walk of life on Partizan, all united in the desire to leave the past behind and start a new life. Currently being used as a flagship for the allied forces of Millennium Break and the Witch in Glass. Obelle : A small, seaside town between Apostolos territory to the north and the independent lands of the Prophet's Path to the south. Once a sleepy agricultural town with tiny small tourist industry, it became the starting place of the now all-consuming war on Partizan when the Divine Past was driven into the sands west of the town. //Divines\\\\ The Divine Motion (she/her): Long after enemy fuel tanks run empty, Motion continues to power Apostolosian machines of war (like its infamous retinue, the Black Century) and service (including the massive Barranca Loop that allows Apostolos to regularly launch ships spaceward). Ver'MIllion Blue's rival. Has taken a new elect, Laurel, a clone of the Apostolosian war hero Cassander Timaeus Berenice, a young, yet intuitive Apostolosian commander known to be attentive and authoritative in equal measure. The Divine Asepsis (it/its) : \"Cleansed and purified\" Vigil City with its army of micro-mechanical servants until Millennium Break knocked it down for the count… and until Kalmera Broun took some of its parts to study in their free time. //Things\\\\ The Demiurgos (aka \"The Demiurge,\" Laurel's mech): A Pneuma model (see below) which has been modified using cutting edge research and materials, including recovered parts of the supposed \"exemplar,\" Branched materials, stabilized Perennial Wave particles, and, of course, Motion's own divine power. The Blue Channel: Kal'Mera's Broun's corvette. Though it's rated for spaceflight and features a cargo space large enough to hold at least three hollows, it does not have the ability to break escape velocity on its own. \"Autonomy Itself\"/\"The True Divine\"/The God of the Nobel/The God of Logos Kantel (they/them): Granted the power to transform Partizan into a living world to Logos Kantel 1000 years ago.

      "description": "With Kalar and the Figure in Bismuth rescued from the Pact and their apparently game-changing intelligence delivered—albeit cut in two and sent to different people—Millennium Break is ready to confront operation Shackled Sun directly. As such, the Company of the Spade and the Blue Channel lead an a 1-in-1000 attack against the secret Portcullis gate deep within the heart of Girandole. Can the group make it through the chemical clouds of the gas giant, board the enemy station, and stop the Pact's plan in its track? And more importantly: Win or lose, how will the world see them as they do it? This week on PARTIZAN: The Gate ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Curtain of Divinity : Though Kesh is technically governed through an elaborate parliamentary democracy, the truth is that The Curtain of Divinity, a secretive organization inside of the Stel (and with agents across all of the Principality), serves as the actual power behind the throne. Knowledge of the Curtain is carefully guarded, and its membership is even further protected. Currently, the Curtain is most firmly aligned with Kesh and Nideo, and fights in an open war against the Pact of Necessary Venture and Millennium Break. The Pact of Necessary Venture : Though they trace their lineage back to an exploratory committee founded in the late 14th century of the Perfect Millenium, the Pact was not made in earnest until five years ago in 1418 PM, soon after hostilities began between Kesh and Apostolos. Currently, the Pact has finds its greatest support from members of Columnar and Apostolos. They are in a state of open conflict against the Curtain and Millennium Break. Millennium Break: Dissidents, idealogues, rebels, and mercenaries. Even now, they agree on little, except this: It is time for a new Millennium. GLORY: With the help of advanced Columnar cloning science, the Glory Project (or simply GLORY), claims to have resurrected (and made immortal) heroes of the nation's past called Eidolons. On Partizan, they field Kleos, Apothesa, Vervain, and the squad's leader: Laurel, elect of Motion. Company of the Spade: A veteran mercenary unit founded by space miners who learned how to pilot Hollows in the most dangerous of settings. They've been brought to Partizan to combine both types of expertise. //People\\\\ Logos Kantel (they/them): The prophet who, it is said, brought life to the once barren moon of Partizan. For nearly 1000 years, they have been held as prisoner by the Curtain in the depths of a prison underneath the Chasmata Quarry. Now, \"rescued\" by the Pact of Necessary Venture, they are being led to a secret facility inside of a hidden Portcullis, deep in the depths of Girandole, where they will be able to reach out to their god for aid. Little do they know, the Pact of Necessary Venture is poised to enslave the being that comes through the gate. The Witch in Glass (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the body of the Divine Past. Now scours Partizan for the lost, injured, and unsure, recruiting them into her growing city-state. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. Haunted by an old foe. Gur Sevraq (he/them): Once the Leader of the Church of the Resin Heart, now a discontinuous prophet: One self welded to the consciousness of their greatest living rival, the other a representative of everything he once opposed. Once controlled the Divine Future, but that was lost to Stel Nideo after his great fall. Cas'alear Rizah (cas/cas', they/them) : Leader of the Swordbreakers, sibling of the Glorious Princept. Cas has brown skin with dark green hair up in a bun, with a few strands hanging down in front of their face (which is framed with similarly colored scales covering cas' jawline and neck. Broken sword tattoos under their eyes. Reputation as being beautiful and brave by allies, unflinching and unpredictable by foes. Pilots the notorious Ataraxia. Was badly wounded in the defense against Motion and GLORY in Auspice, and now, through a combination of the Witch in Glass' gifts and ongoing rehabilitation, is working to return to fighting form. Laurel (they/them): Elect of Motion, new mortal leader of GLORY, and a clone of Cassander Timaeus Berenice, an Apostolosian war hero of the Golden era. Recently selected by Motion as her new elect, catapulting them to leadership. They have served well, with a remarkable propensity for strategic thinking and tactical execution. Pilots the Demiurgos. Vervain (they/them): Member of GLORY, clone of their Apostolosian tragic hero namesake, and a bright reflection of Ver'Million Blue. Using their Divine, the historic Vervain was able to predict enemy movements and turn the tide of battles with uncanny strategic foresight. Kleos (they/them): Skin is fully like a shiny maroon. Bright red cloak wrapped around neck and hanging back like a cape, totally topless otherwise. Khaki army pant capris, a spear slung over their back, and a heavy sidearm at their waist. Pilots the Epoche. Apothesa (they/them): Former field commander of GLORY's main Hallow unit. Supposedly a clone of the ancient (perhaps even mythical) eidolon of construction, military action, and history. They have big team-parent energy. Long wavy hair, perfectly kept pilot uniform, stern features, sterner attitude. Pilots the Aporia. //Places\\\\ Girandole: The massive gas giant around which Partizan orbits. Deep within its gaseous storms rests a secret Portcullis which leads towards the space sector containing the Nobel homeworld and Autonomy Itself. The Reflecting Pool: The city that has emerged inside of the Divine Past's body, led by the Witch in Glass. Its citizens come from every walk of life on Partizan, all united in the desire to leave the past behind and start a new life. Currently being used as a flagship for the allied forces of Millennium Break and the Witch in Glass. Obelle : A small, seaside town between Apostolos territory to the north and the independent lands of the Prophet's Path to the south. Once a sleepy agricultural town with tiny small tourist industry, it became the starting place of the now all-consuming war on Partizan when the Divine Past was driven into the sands west of the town. //Divines\\\\ The Divine Space (it/its): Key to the Portcullis system's galactic operations, the Divine Space not only can step in to manage the opening and closing of the gates, but more importantly, tracks and monitors everything that moves from one Portcullis to another, giving Stel Orion, the Pact of Necessary Venture, and its elect Rye a serious advantage in all matters strategic and logistical. The Divine Motion (she/her): Long after enemy fuel tanks run empty, Motion continues to power Apostolosian machines of war (like its infamous retinue, the Black Century) and service (including the massive Barranca Loop that allows Apostolos to regularly launch ships spaceward). Ver'MIllion Blue's rival. Has taken a new elect, Laurel, a clone of the Apostolosian war hero Cassander Timaeus Berenice, a young, yet intuitive Apostolosian commander known to be attentive and authoritative in equal measure. //Things\\\\ The Demiurgos (aka \"The Demiurge,\" Laurel's mech): A Pneuma model (see below) which has been modified using cutting edge research and materials, including recovered parts of the supposed \"exemplar,\" Branched materials, stabilized Perennial Wave particles, and, of course, Motion's own divine power. The Blue Channel: Kal'Mera's Broun's corvette. Though it's rated for spaceflight and features a cargo space large enough to hold at least three hollows, it does not have the ability to break escape velocity on its own. \"Autonomy Itself\"/\"The True Divine\"/The God of the Nobel/The God of Logos Kantel (they/them): Granted the power to transform Partizan into a living world to Logos Kantel 1000 years ago. Guided the Nobel and other cultures in the Scutum-Centaurus arm through the course of their history. Operation Shackled Sun: An ongoing military operation led by Motion and her allies in the Pact of Necessary Venture. Through the use of a web of space stations called The Lattice , the Pact plans to capture the raw energy of the being that is worshipped as \"Autonomy Itself.\" The Portcullis System: Once, every 10 days, the Portcullis System activates. A hundred thousand of these massive structures, elongated, city-sized hexagons of stone and circuitry, shudder, shake, and howl all at once. And at the edge of every star system in the Divine Principality, a geyser of liquid energy, red and oppressive, explodes into darkness. Ships emerge from these crimson and white waves. Ships filled with medical supplies and mineral wealth, purveyors of faith and career politicians, censored information and refurbished war machines. The lifeblood of a vibrant, vicious empire. Curtain Ideograms : A vast collection of graphic symbols and code words used by the Curtain to communicate information clandestinely. //Additional Notes\\\\ ACT 1 SCORE Challenge #1: Rescue Kalar and the Figure in Bismuth Roll 1: Kalar: 3d6, 10 Cool (spinnable - SPUN: 13) Roll 2: Figure: 3d6, 15 Doubt (LOCKED) Roll 3: Thisbe: 3d6 11 Cool (Spinnable - LOCKED) Roll 4: Phrygian: 3d6 9 Doubt (Spinnable - LOCKED) Roll 5: Figure, 3d6, 7 Cool (Spinnable - LOCKED) Roll 6: Kalar, 3d6: 11 Doubt (Spinnable - LOCKED) Roll 7: Thisbe: 3d6, 13 Cool (Spinnable - LOCKED) Roll 8: N/A Total Cool: 44 Total Doubt: 35 Act 1 Total: 9 COOL Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Sylvi Clare ( @sylvisurfer ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora and Austin Walker Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Text by Austin Walker Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "It is the year 1424 of the Perfect Millennium. It is now. In the chaos-depths of Girandole, the Pact of Necessary Venture is shackling a god to an engine, an engine that would become a star, a star that would consume Partizan. A small sacrifice, they believe: necessary venture. Because what it will earn is clear: A new era for the galaxy, in which they would be the principled hegemons. But across the system, those few who know the danger of this plot rally to stop them. A few hundred thousand miles away, on the moon of Partizan, members of MIllennium Break ready their attack force, which will be brought up en masse into orbit by the Reflecting Pool, flagship of their dubious ally, the Witch in Glass. Meanwhile: Rushing from the now-repaired Partizan Portcullis: A Curtain Armada, eager to rendezvous with Mourningbride and finally leash this star system gone feral. But this climactic clash will not be won with arms alone. Throughout the Principality--war is fought not only on the battlefield, but also across an emerging media landscape, one where the truth is determined by salvos of propaganda, shaped by onslaughts of distraction, and interpreted by the sweet, whispered sermons of falsified prophets. And so the question is not simply \"Can Millennium Break win?\" It is \"What does victory look like? \" Will they be seen as revolutionary heroes or jealous upstarts? Compromised cynics or naive insurgents? Can they break free from the gravity of the old logics in a way so confident, so stunning, that they inspire people everywhere to see the world differently, to not only raise arms, but lock them in solidarity, too? This week on PARTIZAN: Operation Shackled Sun: Act 1: The Fray ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Curtain of Divinity : Though Kesh is technically governed through an elaborate parliamentary democracy, the truth is that The Curtain of Divinity, a secretive organization inside of the Stel (and with agents across all of the Principality), serves as the actual power behind the throne. Knowledge of the Curtain is carefully guarded, and its membership is even further protected. Was originally established to rein in the Principality's most tyrannical institutions and encourage growth and equity over generations, while hiding the truth of what lied beyond the Scutum-Centaurus Portcullis. Over time, their more noble aims were eroded, and only this final goal remained, along with a much more selfish goal of controlling the state. Currently, the Curtain is most firmly aligned with Kesh and Nideo, and fights in an open war against the Pact of Necessary Venture and Millennium Break. The Pact of Necessary Venture : Though they trace their lineage back to an exploratory committee founded in the late 14th century of the Perfect Millenium, the Pact was not made in earnest until five years ago in 1418 PM, soon after hostilities began between Kesh and Apostolos. It's original leadership committee, Plumeria, Gallica, Myosotis, Rye, and Hyacinth determined that to ensure the future stability of the Principality, the Pact would establish a power base in the Scutum–Centaurus arm, amass a vast fleet using the unexploited resources there, and sweep both princepts out of power, replacing the role with a five-part council representing each Stel equally. Each was an elect: Plumeria the elect of Past, Gallica of Present, Myosotis of Future, Rye of Space, and Hyacinth of Motion. Plumeria and Myosotis were killed during Gur Sevraq's theft of the Divine Future. Plumeria's successor, Cymbidium, was killed when Past crashed into the sands of the Prophet's Path. Hyacinth was killed in combat by the Rapid Evening, and was replaced by Laurel, a member of GLORY. Currently, the Pact has finds its greatest support from members of Columnar and Apostolos. They are in a state of open conflict against the Curtain and Millennium Break. Millennium Break: Dissidents, idealogues, rebels, and mercenaries. Even now, they agree on little, except this: It is time for a new Millennium. //People\\\\ Logos Kantel (they/them): The prophet who, it is said, brought life to the once barren moon of Partizan.

Little do they know, the Pact of Necessary Venture is poised to enslave the being that comes through the gate. Gucci Garantine (she/her) : Defector from Stel Kesh, controller of House Brightline and HORIZON's efforts on Partizan. Now a powerful member of Millennium Break's political class, heading the Party of the Masque. The Witch in Glass (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the body of the Divine Past. Now scours Partizan for the lost, injured, and unsure, recruiting them into her growing city-state. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. Haunted by an old foe. Xiphion, aka Zig'ell Barbos, aka The Red Roc (zig/zig's, he/him): Elect of the Divine Valour and rising star in the Apostolosian military. Zig'ell kept zig's Apostolosian name in personal use even after being chosen by Valour as its elect. He is a rising star in the Apostolosian military, famed for his talent as a pilot and commander. There is good reason for this: zig spent years serving as Cas'alear Rizah's confidant and lieutenant, before being promoted and transferred into service directly under the Divine Motion, working closely as the elect Laurel's right hand. A true believer in the Pact's mission to split the Principality up. //Places\\\\ Girandole: The massive gas giant around which Partizan orbits. Deep within its gaseous storms rests a secret Portcullis which leads towards the space sector containing the Nobel homeworld and Autonomy Itself. The Reflecting Pool: The city that has emerged inside of the Divine Past's body, led by the Witch in Glass. Its citizens come from every walk of life on Partizan, all united in the desire to leave the past behind and start a new life. Currently being used as a flagship for the allied forces of Millennium Break and the Witch in Glass. //Divines\\\\ The Divine Imperium: One of the first Divines of the Principality. It has blessed its Hallowed with extended flight capabilities and, in some cases, a burning aura of authority. The Divine Valour: A machine the size of a large Hallow, Valour can transform between a vast, roc-like bird form and a more traditional humanoid model. Soldiers claim that serving under Valour gives them a noticeable boost to their morale, but it is unclear if this is a feature of their proximity to the Divine or to its elect. //Things\\\\ \"Autonomy Itself\"/\"The True Divine\"/The God of the Nobel/The God of Logos Kantel (they/them): Granted the power to transform Partizan into a living world to Logos Kantel 1000 years ago. Guided the Nobel and other cultures in the Scutum-Centaurus arm through the course of their history. Operation Shackled Sun: An ongoing military operation led by Motion and her allies in the Pact of Necessary Venture. Through the use of a web of space stations called The Lattice , the Pact plans to capture the raw energy of the being that is worshipped as \"Autonomy Itself.\" The Portcullis System: Once, every 10 days, the Portcullis System activates. A hundred thousand of these massive structures, elongated, city-sized hexagons of stone and circuitry, shudder, shake, and howl all at once. And at the edge of every star system in the Divine Principality, a geyser of liquid energy, red and oppressive, explodes into darkness. Ships emerge from these crimson and white waves. Ships filled with medical supplies and mineral wealth, purveyors of faith and career politicians, censored information and refurbished war machines. The lifeblood of a vibrant, vicious empire. The Will of the Witch: The Hallow of the Figure in Bismuth. A hulking monstrosity in the shape of a knight, which can nevertheless move with explosive acceleration. Splintering crystals run through its body, and when confronted directly, its use of enormous weaponry separates it from other mechs of its scale. Mow: A recovered Zenith-A Project Eudaimonia prototype model. The build of a gorilla, quadrupedal & topheavy, a saddle horn-like addition on the back, battered but lovingly maintained. Curtain Ideograms : A vast collection of graphic symbols and code words used by the Curtain to communicate information clandestinely. \"The Bitten Bullet\" : A large personnel transport owned by the Pact of Necessary Venture. Currently docked on the Lattice, holding a large number of Pact troops… and the stowaways Kalar and the Figure in Bismuth.

      "description": "For generations, the Chasmata family has had an outsized place in the politics of Stel Kesh. Certainly, they were as loyal and stately as any other great house of the self-proclaimed First Stel. But their income, prestige, and reach seemed to exceed their material position in the Principality. Partly, this had to do with the dynasty's close ties to the Curtain. Like the Kesh family itself, many children of House Chasmata would go on to serve in the Principality's most secret and sacred institution. But there was something else, too. A reward, perhaps, for a most difficult service. This week on PARTIZAN: The Prison at the Top of the World ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ House Chasmata: Despite not being the highest ranking house on Partizan, the Chasmata family has governed Stel Kesh's holdings on the moon for as long as Kesh has been here. But in the last century, the family seems more interested in an archeological dig in the northern ice cap than in managing its estates. This has not, unfortunately for Apostolos, limited the amount of military might that Chasmata can bring to bear in an emergency. The Curtain of Divinity: Though Kesh is technically governed through an elaborate parliamentary democracy, the truth is that The Curtain of Divinity, a secretive organization inside of the Stel (and with agents across all of the Principality), serves as the actual power behind the throne. Knowledge of the Curtain is carefully guarded, and its membership is even further protected. Was originally established to rein in the Principality's most tyrannical institutions and encourage growth and equity over generations, while hiding the truth of what lied beyond the Scutum-Centaurus Portcullis. Over time, their more noble aims were eroded, and only this final goal remained, along with a much more selfish goal of controlling the state. Has recently announced its presence on Partizan and throughout the Principality. Currently in conflict with the Pact of Necessary Venture, Millennium Break, and the Organization for the Foundation of the Orion Republic. //People\\\\ Xiphion, aka Zig'ell Barbos, aka The Red Roc (zig/zig's, he/him): Elect of the Divine Valour and rising star in the Apostolosian military. Zig'ell kept zig's Apostolosian name in personal use even after being chosen by Valour as its elect. He is a rising star in the Apostolosian military, famed for his talent as a pilot and commander. There is good reason for this: zig spent years serving as Cas'alear Rizah's confidant and lieutenant, before being promoted and transferred into service directly under the Divine Motion, working closely as the elect Laurel's right hand. A true believer in the Pact's mission to split the Principality up. Corrasion (they/them): A branched sent with a research group, including Phrygian, to Partizan in order to investigate Gur Sevraq and their claims of a True Divine. Gucci Garantine (she/her) : Defector from Stel Kesh, controller of House Brightline and HORIZON's efforts on Partizan. Now a powerful member of Millennium Break's political class, heading the Party of the Masque. The Witch in Glass (she/her): A former scion of Kesh who, after knitting a bond with the adversary Perennial, came into control of the body of the Divine Past. Now scours Partizan for the lost, injured, and unsure, recruiting them into her growing city-state. A shaky ally of Millennium Break. Haunted by an old foe. Cas'alear Rizah (cas/cas', they/them) : Leader of the Swordbreakers, sibling of the Glorious Princept. Cas has brown skin with dark green hair up in a bun, with a few strands hanging down in front of their face (which is framed with similarly colored scales covering cas' jawline and neck. Broken sword tattoos under their eyes. Reputation as being beautiful and brave by allies, unflinching and unpredictable by foes. Pilots the notorious Ataraxia. Was badly wounded in the defense against Motion and GLORY in Auspice, and now, through a combination of the Witch in Glass' gifts and ongoing rehabilitation, is working to return to fighting form. Agon Ortlights (she/her): Aided by her servicebot companions, Agon worked hard to attain the rank of lieutenant in the Company of the Spade, where she's become a veteren mercenary, a skilled miner, and a hell of a drinking buddy. Sloe Uplight (he/him): His business card says \"Private Historian,\" his parlor rooms' security system says \"information broker,\" and his grinning mouth says \"no difference.\" A Kesh academic turned freelance fixer, turned again to Millennium Break intelligence officer. //Places\\\\ Chasmata Quarry: Founded almost one thousand years ago, the Chasmata family has been digging into the ice and stone at the north pole for as long as Kesh has been on the planet. Activity in the area has increased in the last century. No information gets in or out. Every scout sent to investigate the area has been lost forever. The Reflecting Pool: The city that has emerged inside of the Divine Past's body, led by the Witch in Glass. Its citizens come from every walk of life on Partizan, all united in the desire to leave the past behind and start a new life. //Divines\\\\ The Divine Valour: A machine the size of a large Hallow, Valour can transform between a vast, roc-like bird form and a more traditional humanoid model. Soldiers claim that serving under Valour gives them a noticeable boost to their morale, but it is unclear if this is a feature of their proximity to the Divine or to its elect. The Divine Past: Part floating city, part living library, and current home to the Reflecting Pool. The Divine Past was built tens of thousands of years before the Divine Principality was created. It stores an untold amount of information about the cultures it has observed, including the Divine Principality itself. //Things\\\\ Zenith-K Project Veneer: Melee-ranged shield mechs. Internals are similar to the Zenith-A project Kosmos which SI and the Rapid Evening fought in similarly cold conditions back during the Fort Icebreaker mission. Except instead of the reverse jointed legs and the spears, these have huge tower shields with pneumatic pile bunkers. Zenith-K Project Cornice: A cheap, mass produced version of the sniper form of the Katalepsis, which is the model name of Ver'Million Blue's hollow. These are glass cannons meant to lay down an absurd amount of long range fire. AdArm Quiver : On first glance, you might not think this is a hollow at all. But once the low, wide three-legged firing brace starts to walk, you'd understand that these artillery machines are able to move and even leap with great force and speed, making them excellent at holding (or hammering) an unstable frontline. \"The Bitten Bullet\" (referred to but not named) : A large personnel transport owned by the Pact of Necessary Venture.

      "description": "Miles to the south of the Chasmata Quarry, AO Rooke loads an artillery shell into cannon. It's the third to be fired, in a set of 50. He is providing cover, he was told, for the operation's infiltration unit to get what it was they needed. \"Except,\" he worried to himself, \"the infiltration unit did not know what it was they needed. He punctuated his concern by slamming the hatch on the howitzer shut. \"And that crew, specifically,\" he thought, \"is a strange fit for infiltration to begin with.\" And so AO Rooke had a thought: He and his crew would fire 50 rounds into the sky towards the Quarry. But he would do so at two-thirds the normal speed, giving Kalar, Phrygian, Sovereign Immunity, and the Figure in Bismuth just a little more time before the attention of the mysterious base fell on them. This week on PARTIZAN: The Tunnels Beneath ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ House Chasmata: Despite not being the highest ranking house on Partizan, the Chasmata family has governed Stel Kesh's holdings on the moon for as long as Kesh has been here. But in the last century, the family seems more interested in an archeological dig in the northern ice cap than in managing its estates. This has not, unfortunately for Apostolos, limited the amount of military might that Chasmata can bring to bear in an emergency. The Curtain of Divinity: Though Kesh is technically governed through an elaborate parliamentary democracy, the truth is that The Curtain of Divinity, a secretive organization inside of the Stel (and with agents across all of the Principality), serves as the actual power behind the throne. Knowledge of the Curtain is carefully guarded, and its membership is even further protected. Was originally established to rein in the Principality's most tyrannical institutions and encourage growth and equity over generations, while hiding the truth of what lied beyond the Scutum-Centaurus Portcullis. Over time, their more noble aims were eroded, and only this final goal remained, along with a much more selfish goal of controlling the state.

Zig'ell kept zig's Apostolosian name in personal use even after being chosen by Valour as its elect. He is a rising star in the Apostolosian military, famed for his talent as a pilot and commander. There is good reason for this: zig spent years serving as Cas'alear Rizah's confidant and lieutenant, before being promoted and transferred into service directly under the Divine Motion, working closely as the elect Laurel's right hand.

You could write a book about the excavations spread across the Columnar's Memoria Teardrop, or those digs spread hive-like through the Apostolosian Barranca, or the industrial pockmarks across the long Orion flats of the Low Slate.

      "description": "On a map, it would seem as if the Blue Channel and its inhabitants, revolutionaries of the Millennium Break movement, were nearing freedom from the Partizan system. But a map does not show the whole of the picture. For instance, a map would not reveal that heels of Aponia, hallow of GLORY ace pilot Sabeeha, were scraping across the roof of Kal'Mera Broun's ship. It would not show the members of the ship's crew taking increasingly risky action. And it would it show what surprises lie ahead of them, at their nearest destination... This week on PARTIZAN: Orbital Decay ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Pact of Necessary Venture : Though they trace their lineage back to an exploratory committee founded in the late 14th century of the Perfect Millenium, the Pact was not made in earnest until five years ago in 1418 PM, soon after hostilities began between Kesh and Apostolos. It's original leadership committee, Plumeria, Gallica, Myosotis, Rye, and Hyacinth determined that to ensure the future stability of the Principality, the Pact would establish a power base in the Scutum–Centaurus arm, amass a vast fleet using the unexploited resources there, and sweep both princepts out of power, replacing the role with a five-part council representing each Stel equally. Each was an elect: Plumeria the elect of Past, Gallica of Present, Myosotis of Future, Rye of Space, and Hyacinth of Motion. Plumeria and Myosotis were killed during Gur Sevraq's theft of the Divine Future. Plumeria's successor, Cymbidium, was killed when Past crashed into the sands of the Prophet's Path. Hyacinth was killed in combat by the Rapid Evening, but has already been replaced. GLORY: With the help of advanced Columnar cloning science, the Glory Project (or simply GLORY), claims to have resurrected (and made immortal) heroes of the nation's past called Eidolons. On Partizan, they field Kleos, Apothesa, Vervain, Sabeeha, and the squad's leader: Laurel, elect of Motion. //People\\\\ Avar (they/them) and Ryrira (she/her): Members of the Church of the Resin heart. Once Gur Sevraq's chief of security and quartermaster, respectively. Have a child, M'reb. Onboard the Blue Channel. Si'dra Balos (Si/Si's, they/them): During their time in a communications division of the Apostolosian Navy, Si'dra saw the cost of war first hand. Now they dream of a world where people can connect instead of fight. Onboard the Blue Channel. Jesset City (he/him) : Previously worked for Adamant Arms and Manufacturing, Jesset became full time Oxblood Clan lieutenant and then a major figure in Millennium Break. Expert technician, veteran hollow pilot, and Cipher Certified by Stel Nideo. Onboard the Blue Channel. Eiden Teak (he/him) : Soldier and commander in the Sable Court. Wears the wounds of past fights on him with a distinct sort of pride, inherited from his time fighting as an Apostolosian soldier: He's missing right leg under the knee, and a number of his antlers have been snapped and broken. Wears loose olive drab fatigues, marked by the occult insignia and wards of the Court. Onboard the Blue Channel. Sabeeha (they/them): Sabeeha is pound-for-pound GLORY's best pilot, though their specialities also include infiltration, disguise, and sabotage. Brown, light olive skin. Brown hair kept short and wavy, close to their head. Face and body both a little long, a little chubby. Big brown eyes. Slightly bushy brows. Pilots the Aponia. KRK-56 (he/him): Columnar long haul space freighter pilot/security for the SOV Feldspar Blue. Perched along his hull are many AdArm Scourge units--mosquito-like mechs that KRK can pilot remotely. Rye (he/him): Elect of the Divine Space, second of the Nine Coronet of Stel Orion, Chief Signatory of the Pact of Necessary Venture, and Provedore of all Divinity. //Places\\\\ Barranca : To the north of Obelle lies the Apostolosian province of Barranca, where mediterranian subtropical shores give way to a vast latticework of ravines and crags. There, military bases and civilian settlements sit in the crooks and alcoves, shaded by high canyon walls. Rising above it all is the famed Barranca Loop, a massive suspended cable system that runs up above the atmosphere like a giant bridge, and which allows Apostolos to launch ships and cargo into space. Heavily patrolled and under complete control of Stel Apostolos. //Divines\\\\ The Divine Motion (she/her): Long after enemy fuel tanks run empty, Motion continues to power Apostolosian machines of war (like its infamous retinue, the Black Century) and service (including the massive Barranca Loop that allows Apostolos to regularly launch ships spaceward). Ver'MIllion Blue's rival. The Divne Space (it/its): Tracks and analyzes all Portcullis System data. Was instrumental in the Principality's colonization efforts, especially after Stel Orion's incorporation. Unknown whether it or its elect, Rye, have any direct operational control of the system . //Things\\\\ The Portcullis System: Once, every 10 days, the Portcullis System activates. A hundred thousand of these massive structures, elongated, city-sized hexagons of stone and circuitry, shudder, shake, and howl all at once. And at the edge of every star system in the Divine Principality, a geyser of liquid energy, red and oppressive, explodes into darkness. Ships emerge from these crimson and white waves. Ships filled with medical supplies and mineral wealth, purveyors of faith and career politicians, censored information and refurbished war machines. The lifeblood of a vibrant, vicious empire. Aponia (Sabeeha's Hallow): A highly modified Kosmos unit (see below) which is able to transforms into a high-mobility aircraft mode. Though it can be outfitted with a custom, solid-state rifle, this limits its maneuverability and flight length, so Sabeeha often chooses to leave the weapon behind, instead favoring the machine's built in energy blades, featured on its wings in flight mode, or extending from elbows and knees in humanoid forum. As a holdout weapon, this configuration also comes with energy-powered throwing blades. Adamant Arms and Artifice Murders: These hollows are built for area denial, especially in space. They shift between two modes, a defensive \"closed wing\" mode, where heavy metal armor bolts surround their bodies like a cape, and \"open wing\" mode where those wings spread wide and can be fired. The wings consist of a dozen \"feathers\" each, with each long flight feather can be fired as a blunt weapon with its own onboard directional engine and booster. These feathers can be used as direct attack weapons, but are often instead used for area denial, blasting off along with many other feathers and then orbiting around a location in order to make the airspace around it deadly. Once Murders are able to deploy a large number of their feathers, an entire operational area can become a death trap. The Blue Channel: Kal'Mera's Broun's corvette. Though it's rated for spaceflight and features a cargo space large enough to hold at least three hollows, it does not have the ability to break escape velocity on its own. The Voice of the Exemplar : Howls and echoes through the canyons of the Barranca, where its power is captured by the Barranca Loop. Modular Base Kit: A collection of materials for the modular construction of an off-world headquarters for Millennium Break. Includes housing, water and air filters, an energy generator, communications equipment, agricultural gear, and basic trade goods (whether to be used as bribes or for the legitimate purchase of land). //Additional Notes\\\\ Primary Objective: Escape Partizan Secondary Objective: Safely extract with the Modular Base Kit Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ), Sylvia Clare ( @sylvisurfer ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Produced by Ali Acampora Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Text by Austin Walker Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

Both OFOR and their opposition, the yet-unnamed Principality loyalist faction, have support across class demographics. Many.corporations and independent guilds see OFOR as an opportunity for additional profit, while others believe that leaving the Principality is a risk too great to take. After Law's attack on Oxbridge, OFOR has largely relocated in \"The Old Old,\" a region towards the southern pole of Partizan untouched by Logos Kantel's miracle. //People\\\\ Avar (they/them) and Ryrira (she/her): Members of the Church of the Resin heart. Once Gur Sevraq's chief of security and quartermaster, respectively. Have a child, M'reb. Onboard the Blue Channel. Si'dra Balos (Si/Si's, they/them): During their time in a communications division of the Apostolosian Navy, Si'dra saw the cost of war first hand. Now they dream of a world where people can connect instead of fight. Onboard the Blue Channel. Jesset City (he/him) : Previously worked for Adamant Arms and Manufacturing, Jesset became full time Oxblood Clan lieutenant and then a major figure in Millennium Break. Expert technician, veteran hollow pilot, and Cipher Certified by Stel Nideo. Onboard the Blue Channel. Eiden Teak (he/him) : Soldier and commander in the Sable Court. Wears the wounds of past fights on him with a distinct sort of pride, inherited from his time fighting as an Apostolosian soldier: He's missing right leg under the knee, and a number of his antlers have been snapped and broken. Wears loose olive drab fatigues, marked by the occult insignia and wards of the Court. Onboard the Blue Channel. Sabeeha (they/them): Sabeeha is pound-for-pound GLORY's best pilot, though their specialities also include infiltration, disguise, and sabotage. Brown, light olive skin. Brown hair kept short and wavy, close to their head. Face and body both a little long, a little chubby. Big brown eyes. Slightly bushy brows. Pilots the Aponia. //Places\\\\ Barranca : To the north of Obelle lies the Apostolosian province of Barranca, where mediterranian subtropical shores give way to a vast latticework of ravines and crags. There, military bases and civilian settlements sit in the crooks and alcoves, shaded by high canyon walls. Rising above it all is the famed Barranca Loop, a massive suspended cable system that runs up above the atmosphere like a giant bridge, and which allows Apostolos to launch ships and cargo into space. Heavily patrolled and under complete control of Stel Apostolos. //Divines\\\\ The Divine Motion (she/her): Long after enemy fuel tanks run empty, Motion continues to power Apostolosian machines of war (like its infamous retinue, the Black Century) and service (including the massive Barranca Loop that allows Apostolos to regularly launch ships spaceward). Ver'MIllion Blue's rival. //Things\\\\ Aponia (Sabeeha's Hallow): A highly modified Kosmos unit (see below) which is able to transforms into a high-mobility aircraft mode. Though it can be outfitted with a custom, solid-state rifle, this limits its maneuverability and flight length, so Sabeeha often chooses to leave the weapon behind, instead favoring the machine's built in energy blades, featured on its wings in flight mode, or extending from elbows and knees in humanoid forum. As a holdout weapon, this configuration also comes with energy-powered throwing blades. Adamant Arms and Artifice Murders: These hollows are built for area denial, especially in space. They shift between two modes, a defensive \"closed wing\" mode, where heavy metal armor bolts surround their bodies like a cape, and \"open wing\" mode where those wings spread wide and can be fired. The wings consist of a dozen \"feathers\" each, with each long flight feather can be fired as a blunt weapon with its own onboard directional engine and booster. These feathers can be used as direct attack weapons, but are often instead used for area denial, blasting off along with many other feathers and then orbiting around a location in order to make the airspace around it deadly. Once Murders are able to deploy a large number of their feathers, an entire operational area can become a death trap. The Blue Channel: Kal'Mera's Broun's corvette. Though it's rated for spaceflight and features a cargo space large enough to hold at least three hollows, it does not have the ability to break escape velocity on its own. The Voice of the Exemplar : Howls and echoes through the canyons of the Barranca, where its power is captured by the Barranca Loop. Modular Base Kit: A collection of materials for the modular construction of an off-world headquarters for Millennium Break. Includes housing, water and air filters, an energy generator, communications equipment, agricultural gear, and basic trade goods (whether to be used as bribes or for the legitimate purchase of land). //Additional Notes\\\\ Primary Objective: Escape Partizan Secondary Objective: Safely extract with the Modular Base Kit Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ), Sylvia Clare ( @sylvisurfer ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Produced by Ali Acampora Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Text by Austin Walker Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "As the shape in the sea draws ever near, much of SBBR--with the help of their rivals in the Company of the Spade--begin to evacuate hundreds of thousands out of a city of millions. But Kal'mera Broun turns elsewhere, to their ship, looking for guidance before this new invader arrives. This week on PARTIZAN: The Red Light ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ Organization for the Foundation of the Orion Republic (OFOR): A group of growing import in Orion territory, who advocate for Orion's secession from the Divine Princiipality and re-establishment as a league of democratic, merchant republics. Both OFOR and their opposition, the yet-unnamed Principality loyalist faction, have support across class demographics. Many.corporations and independent guilds see OFOR as an opportunity for additional profit, while others believe that leaving the Principality is a risk too great to take. The Party of the Wolf: One of two quickly growing parties inside of Millennium Break, named for their fallen hero, Valence. Though both parties support revolution, the Party of the Wolf advocates for radical, military action across Partizan and (eventually) the Principality in whole. Currently led by Jesset City. The Party of the Masque: The other major party emerging inside of Millennium Break. Headed by Gucci Garantine, the Masques believe that a fast revolution will burn itself out (or be snuffed by the attention of the Principality writ large). They advocate for precision military action as part of a larger, ideological campaign that will bring the masses to their side of the conflict. The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of the prophet's religious mission. The \"resin heart\" in question is a 3-foot large object pulled from the sea 400+ years ago and displayed as a relic by the Church. It was originally part of the Exemplar. The Curtain of Divinity: Though Kesh is technically governed through an elaborate parliamentary democracy, the truth is that The Curtain of Divinity, a secretive organization inside of the Stel (and with agents across all of the Principality), serves as the actual power behind the throne. Knowledge of the Curtain is carefully guarded, and its membership is even further protected. Was originally established to rein in the Principality's most tyrannical institutions and encourage growth and equity over generations, while hiding the truth of what lied beyond the Scutum-Centaurus Portcullis. Over time, their more noble aims were eroded, and only this final goal remained, along with a much more selfish goal of controlling the state. Is currently in a covert war against the Pact of Necessary Venture. Largely aligned with Stels Kesh and Nideo. The Pact of Necessary Venture : Though they trace their lineage back to an exploratory committee founded in the late 14th century of the Perfect Millenium, the Pact was not made in earnest until five years ago in 1418 PM, soon after hostilities began between Kesh and Apostolos. It's original leadership committee, Plumeria, Gallica, Myosotis, Rye, and Hyacinth determined that to ensure the future stability of the Principality, the Pact would establish a power base in the Scutum–Centaurus arm, amass a vast fleet using the unexploited resources there, and sweep both princepts out of power, replacing the role with a five-part council representing each Stel equally. Each was an elect: Plumeria the elect of Past, Gallica of Present, Myosotis of Future, Rye of Space, and Hyacinth of Motion. Plumeria and Myosotis were killed during Gur Sevraq's theft of the Divine Future. Plumeria's successor, Cymbidium, was killed when Past crashed into the sands of the Prophet's Path. Hyacinth was killed in combat by the Rapid Evening, but has already been replaced. Has gained increasing influence among Stels Columnar and Apostolos. //People\\\\ Gucci Garantine (she/her) : Defector from Stel Kesh, controller of House Brightline and HORIZON's efforts on Partizan. Now a powerful member of Millennium Break's political class, heading the Party of the Masque. Jesset City (he/him) : Previously worked for Adamant Arms and Manufacturing, Jesset became full time Oxblood Clan lieutenant and then a major figure in Millennium Break. Expert technician, veteran hollow pilot, and Cipher Certified by Stel Nideo. Utilizes prostheses on his right arm, switching between an affordable myoelectric model with grip hooks and a custom model specifically designed for interfacing with a hollow cockpit. SBBR's CO for this mission. Agon Ortlights (she/her): Aided by her servicebot companions, Agon worked hard to attain the rank of lieutenant in the Company of the Spade, where she's become a veteren mercenary, a skilled miner, and a hell of a drinking buddy. In recent days, she and the Company have become major backers of the Party of the Masque inside of Millennium Break. But that doesn't mean that she isn't willing to bring her pragmatic talents to bear for the revolutionary project. Cas'alear Rizah (cas/cas', they/them) : Leader of the Swordbreakers, sibling of the Glorious Princept. Cas has brown skin with dark green hair up in a bun, with a few strands hanging down in front of their face (which is framed with similarly colored scales covering cas' jawline and neck. Broken sword tattoos under their eyes. Reputation as being beautiful and brave by allies, unflinching and unpredictable by foes. Pilots the notorious Ataraxia. Was badly wounded in the defense against Motion and GLORY in Auspice. The Witch in Glass (she/her): A mysterious figure who has recently begun prowling the cursed battlefields of Partizan, supposedly kidnapping, leading away, or otherwise retrieving the wounded and desperate. No one knows where she takes them, but reports always indicate that she arrives after the sound of bells and the appearance of strange distant shape in the sky. The Figure in Bismuth (he/them): The Right Hand of the Witch in Glass. Former school teacher, now a supernaturally gifted ace pilot. Comes bearing gifts. Kueen Overture \"K.O.\" Rooke (she/her): SBBR's contact at the Scrivener's Guild. A former ace pilot, lead mechanic, and battlefield commander, KO now uses her expertise to dispatch and guide mercenary units across Partizan as a broker in the Scrivener's Guild. Additionally performs some logistics work for Millennium Break and OFOR. Mother of Audacious Opportunity (\"A.O.\") Rooke. Audacious Opportunity (A.O.) Rooke (he/him) : Was a young freelance mercenary operating under Stel Orion charter before being captured by Stel Kesh on an assignment deep behind enemy lines. After serving in the Rapid Evening's infantry division, A.O. joined Millennium Break and SBBR where he became an ace pilot, able to wield the legendary Panther mech with great skill. //Places\\\\ Oxbridge: Most bridges connect land to land, but the enormous Bridge of the Ox connects ocean ports to the docks of largest freshwater lake on the moon. Under the bridge rests Oxbridge, a dense city of canals and crimson light, and the first large scale Principality settlement to come to the moon, nearly 1000 years ago. Oxbridge is split into three regions: Brightsky West, Underbridge, and Brightsky East. To the East and West, merchants, nobles, and the ever-upwardly mobile live, work, shop and play. But below the bridge's shadow is an undercity of laborers both local and transient, eking by from job to job, day to day, by the fuel of their effort and the light of the red, phosphorescent \"lamps\" that give Underbridge its distinct glow, even in daytime. Connecting it all together are a network of waterways, roads, and secret tunnels. And above it all is the Bridge of the Ox, the symbol of Orion's commitment to (and mastery of) brute-force ideology. In recent days, Oxbridge has been home to rolling gunfights and bloody skirmishes between those loyal to the Principality and those advocating for the state's secession and reformation as a league of merchant republics. The Reflecting Pool: The Witch in Glass' residence, the recovered and partially repaired body of Past. Part floating city, part living library. The Reflecting Pool was originally built tens of thousands of years before the Divine Principality was created. It stores an untold amount of information about the cultures it has observed, including the Divine Principality itself. //Things\\\\ The Red Light: A large figure, covered by red cloth, quickly approaching the Oxbridge shoreline.

      "description": "After months away, SBBR has finally returned to Oxbridge, only to find it burning. Every day, the city is rocked by its own political revolution, as members of the Organization for the Foundation of the Orion Republic--who seek to reform Stel Orion as a league of independent republics--fight against Principality loyalists in the streets, alleys, and canals of the Stel's largest city on Partizan. The City of Little and Plenty is scarring over. But SBBR (and much of Millennium Break) have their own wounds to attend to. This week on PARTIZAN: Guests, Invited and Otherwise ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ Organization for the Foundation of the Orion Republic (OFOR): A group of growing import in Orion territory, who advocate for Orion's secession from the Divine Princiipality and re-establishment as a league of democratic, merchant republics. Both OFOR and their opposition, the yet-unnamed Principality loyalist faction, have support across class demographics. Many.corporations and independent guilds see OFOR as an opportunity for additional profit, while others believe that leaving the Principality is a risk too great to take. The Party of the Wolf: One of two quickly growing parties inside of Millennium Break, named for their fallen hero, Valence. Though both parties support revolution, the Party of the Wolf advocates for radical, military action across Partizan and (eventually) the Principality in whole. Currently led by Jesset City. The Party of the Masque: The other major party emerging inside of Millennium Break. Headed by Gucci Garantine, the Masques believe that a fast revolution will burn itself out (or be snuffed by the attention of the Principality writ large). They advocate for precision military action as part of a larger, ideological campaign that will bring the masses to their side of the conflict. //People\\\\ Gucci Garantine (she/her) : Defector from Stel Kesh, controller of House Brightline and HORIZON's efforts on Partizan. Now a powerful member of Millennium Break's political class, heading the Party of the Masque. Jesset City (he/him) : Previously worked for Adamant Arms and Manufacturing, Jesset became full time Oxblood Clan lieutenant and then a major figure in Millennium Break. Expert technician, veteran hollow pilot, and Cipher Certified by Stel Nideo. Utilizes prostheses on his right arm, switching between an affordable myoelectric model with grip hooks and a custom model specifically designed for interfacing with a hollow cockpit. SBBR's CO for this mission. Cas'alear Rizah (cas/cas', they/them) : Leader of the Swordbreakers, sibling of the Glorious Princept. Cas has brown skin with dark green hair up in a bun, with a few strands hanging down in front of their face (which is framed with similarly colored scales covering cas' jawline and neck. Broken sword tattoos under their eyes. Reputation as being beautiful and brave by allies, unflinching and unpredictable by foes. Pilots the notorious Ataraxia. Was badly wounded in the defense against Motion and GLORY in Auspice. The Witch in Glass (she/her): A mysterious figure who has recently begun prowling the cursed battlefields of Partizan, supposedly kidnapping, leading away, or otherwise retrieving the wounded and desperate. No one knows where she takes them, but reports always indicate that she arrives after the sound of bells and the appearance of strange distant shape in the sky. The Figure in Bismuth (he/them): The Right Hand of the Witch in Glass. Former school teacher, now a supernaturally gifted ace pilot. Comes bearing gifts. //Divines\\\\ The Divine, Arbitrage (It/Its) : It is said that divinity was too long delayed this anteperennial machine, a god of trade. But the truth is, if it wanted to be divine in the twilight era, it simply would've negotiated that deal. //Places\\\\ Oxbridge: Most bridges connect land to land, but the enormous Bridge of the Ox connects ocean ports to the docks of largest freshwater lake on the moon. Under the bridge rests Oxbridge, a dense city of canals and crimson light, and the first large scale Principality settlement to come to the moon, nearly 1000 years ago. Oxbridge is split into three regions: Brightsky West, Underbridge, and Brightsky East. To the East and West, merchants, nobles, and the ever-upwardly mobile live, work, shop and play. But below the bridge's shadow is an undercity of laborers both local and transient, eking by from job to job, day to day, by the fuel of their effort and the light of the red, phosphorescent \"lamps\" that give Underbridge its distinct glow, even in daytime. Connecting it all together are a network of waterways, roads, and secret tunnels. And above it all is the Bridge of the Ox, the symbol of Orion's commitment to (and mastery of) brute-force ideology. In recent days, Oxbridge has been home to rolling gunfights and bloody skirmishes between those loyal to the Principality and those advocating for the state's secession and reformation as a league of merchant republics. Deep Dish Steak House: A loyal bar. Anomaly Theta-27: According to all available public records, a strange gravity well. Absolutely not a farming world. //Things\\\\ The Reflecting Pool: The Witch in Glass' residence.",

      "description": "Inside of the High Altar, dignitaries sit under the flickering light of a projector, while above them, the very subjects of the film they watch fend off an attack that threatens their lives. The divine Motion and GLORY, a unit of cloned Apostolosian supersoldiers which she has taken on as her pet project, have descended onto the small city of Auspice only to run headfirst into SBBR. The initial skirmishes have seen both sides battered and bruised, with schemes blooming into flowers of blood across the battlefield. As the night continues, every step locks into place, a dance sweeping across the city towards a final, desperate dip. This week on PARTIZAN: A Single Shot ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Isle of Logos: An independent nation built by the followers of the prophet Logos Kantel's around their very first church. Though only a small handful of islands in the Prophet's Sea, the Isles keep a standing defense force that rivals any individual unit of the Major Stels. The Branched : A post-human society of beings who have transformed their bodies into forms terrifying and spectacular and free--only to have the threat of war force them to rebuild themselves as soldiers first and foremost. The Black Century: Infamous retinue of the Divine Motion. Each member of this 100-person company serves for 100 years. Motion guarantees them this service. The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of the prophet's religious mission. The \"resin heart\" in question is a 3-foot large object--a component of the Exemplar--pulled from the sea 400+ years ago and displayed as a relic by the Church. In mourning after the loss of Gur Sevraq, though still committed to the cause. GLORY: With the help of advanced Columnar cloning science, the Glory Project (or simply GLORY), claims to have resurrected (and made immortal) heroes of the nation's past called Eidolons. On Partizan, they field Kleos, Apothesa, Vervain, Sabeeha, and the squad's leader: Laurel, elect of Motion. The Zenith Fund: A public institution of Stel Columnar that incubates, defends, and offers testing for teams pursuing cutting edge projects in a wide range of fields including medicine, environmental science, infrastructure, culture, and emerging military hardware. Aids with major projects across every other Stel, including Apostolos' Glory Project. Like the rest of Columnar, increasingly tied to the Pact of Necessary Venture. //People\\\\ Break Lieutenant Kalar Anakalar (he/him): A Millennium Break soldier who specializes in fighting Hollows without one of his own. Large, even for the commonly tall, bird-like Talonites. White and grey plumage, a long or cool coat. Originally a steeplejack in Obelle and a member of a religious community devoted to the Divine Peace. Believes that Divines should not be used in war. Phrygian (they/them): Also known by their callsign, Deck 7, Phrygian is a member of the Branched who arrived on Partizan with a team of undercover researchers who sought to understand the God preached about by Gur Sevraq. While investigating, they and their team were captured and researched by Stel Apostolos and the Pact of Necessary Venture. Phyrgian is the only remaining member of their team. Cas'alear Rizah (cas/cas', they/them) : Leader of the Swordbreakers, sibling of the Glorious Princept. Cas has brown skin with dark green hair up in a bun, with a few strands hanging down in front of their face (which is framed with similarly colored scales covering cas' jawline and neck. Broken sword tattoos under their eyes. Reputation as being beautiful and brave by allies, unflinching and unpredictable by foes. Pilots the notorious Ataraxia. Cares more about metaphors than astrophysics. Boole Batanca (they/them): Chancellor of the Isle of Logos, one of two chief executives of the small sovereign nation. A cephalopod type species, squid-like species, the same as Gigas Acano from Twilight Mirage. White/blue skin with black/brown markings. Tentacle hands, tentacle mouth, eyes adjust in size depending on environment and light. Unlike Gigas, though, this one also has some sort of shell like structure running up their back and parts of their head, almost like hair. Laurel (they/them): Elect of Motion, new mortal leader of GLORY, and a clone of Cassander Timaeus Berenice, an Apostolosian war hero of the Golden era. Recently selected by Motion as her new elect, catapulting them to leadership. They have served well, with a remarkable propensity for strategic thinking and tactical execution. Pilots the Demiurgos. Sabeeha (they/them): Sabeeha is pound-for-pound GLORY's best pilot, though their specialities also include infiltration, disguise, and sabotage. Brown, light olive skin. Brown hair kept short and wavy, close to their head. Face and body both a little long, a little chubby. Big brown eyes. Slightly bushy brows. Pilots the Aporia. Vervain (they/them): Member of GLORY, clone of their Apostolosian tragic hero namesake, and a bright reflection of Ver'Million Blue. Using their Divine, the historic Vervain was able to predict enemy movements and turn the tide of battles with uncanny strategic foresight. Kleos (they/them): Skin is fully like a shiny maroon. Bright red cloak wrapped around neck and hanging back like a cape, totally topless otherwise. Khaki army pant capris, a spear slung over their back, and a heavy sidearm at their waist. Pilots the Epoche. Apothesa (they/them): Former field commander of GLORY's main Hallow unit. Supposedly a clone of the ancient (perhaps even mythical) eidolon of construction, military action, and history. They have big team-parent energy. Long wavy hair, perfectly kept pilot uniform, stern features, sterner attitude. Pilots the Aporia. The Witch in Glass (she/her): A mysterious figure who has recently begun prowling the cursed battlefields of Partizan, supposedly kidnapping, leading away, or otherwise retrieving the wounded and desperate. No one knows where she takes them, but reports always indicate that she arrives after the sound of bells and the appearance of strange distant shape in the sky. //Places\\\\ Auspice: A seaside city in the Prophet's Path north of Marengo (which it is smaller than) and south of Obelle (which it dwarfs). Auspice is the final destination of the land travel portion of the yearly pilgrimage led by the Church of the Resin Heart, which has a great temple in the city called the High Altar. Resting on a landmass that appears on a map to be a finger pointing eastward, it has become a coastal refuge for members of Millennium Break. The Golden Branch: A sector of the galaxy extremely far from PARTIZAN, on the other side of the galactic core. The civilizations of Kesh and Apostolos first began there. Now, it is home to the Branched. //Divines\\\\ The Divine Motion (she/her): Long after enemy fuel tanks run empty, Motion continues to power Apostolosian machines of war (like its infamous retinue, the Black Century) and service (including the massive Barranca Loop that allows Apostolos to regularly launch ships spaceward). Ver'MIllion Blue's rival. Has taken a new elect, Laurel, a clone of the Apostolosian war hero Cassander Timaeus Berenice, a young, yet intuitive Apostolosian commander known to be attentive and authoritative in equal measure. //Things\\\\ Strand Semaphore: Using ancient Hyphan technology, this messenger service is able to send text-based communications to anywhere on-moon, so long as they've built an outpost there. The backbone of the private comms network used by Millennium Break. Ataraxia (Cas'alear's mech): A white, purple, and yellow mantid-shaped machine blessed by the divine Commitment and developed by Stel Columnar's Zenith Fund. Each of its six curved limbs can light up its edges with energy beams. On the ground, it can dance in combat in such a way that any two limbs can be its temporary feet, and when it's in flight, it becomes a complete whirlwind of violence. Named for the philosophical concept key to ancient Stoicism. The Demiurgos (aka \"The Demiurge,\" Laurel's mech): A Pneuma model (see below) which has been modified using cutting edge research and materials, including recovered parts of the supposed \"exemplar,\" Branched materials, stabilized Perennial Wave particles, and, of course, Motion's own divine power. Aponia (Sabeeha's Hallow): A highly modified Kosmos unit (see below) which is able to transforms into a high-mobility aircraft mode. Though it can be outfitted with a custom, solid-state rifle, this limits its maneuverability and flight length, so Sabeeha often chooses to leave the weapon behind, instead favoring the machine's built in energy blades, featured on its wings in flight mode, or extending from elbows and knees in humanoid forum. As a holdout weapon, this configuration also comes with energy-powered throwing blades. Katalepsis Mk. II (Vervain's Hallow): Like Milli's own Katalepsis, this model began as an exploration into combining features from both the Kosmos and the and the Obscura (see below for reference on both). Deep, dark teal with gold accents, rounded head shape built to scan its surroundings. Can launch dozens of drones into the air for reconnaissance and observation, which will quickly locate anything nearby, but must remain stationery to do that. Can launch micro missiles at locked targets from its shoulders. Its signature weapon is a huge V-shaped rifle that gives it a unique silhouette when attached to the Katalepsis' back. Because it is powered by Motion, the V Rifle is able to release incredible damaging energy attacks: Either in a devastating, short range spread when open, or as an incredible powerful long range railgun-like shot at range. Up close, Vervain can run this energy throughout the interior of the V's two \"blades,\" creating a unique, shear-like melee weapon. Epoché (Kleos' Hallow) A Kosmos unit highly modified for top-of-class melee functionality. Deep brown, triangular head headshape, humanoid machine with gold accents, and a faceplate made of brown stone, and heavy skirt plates to defend its upper legs/lower torso. A long, oval shield built onto it's left arm, a pair of grappling hook launchers on its skirt. Wields a guisarme--a spear that has a hook on the reverse side of the blade. The bottom of the weapon's shaft is weighted with a dense metal to allow for heavy clubbing attacks, and since the guisarme is able to split into two, connected by a long electrified cable, both the blade and club are able to be wielded simultaneously. Kleos is known to spin it around in a disorienting fashion and wield either side as a ranged weapon, using the electrified cable to disable anyone who gets caught up in the chain. Aporia (Apothesa's Hallow): A Kosmos unit retrofitted for high level defensive tactics. Able to deploy both physical walls and particle fields to block off areas of the battlefield. Additionally, wields a glaive and shotgun. Zenith-A Project Kosmos (for reference): Designed by the Columnar Zenith Fund for Apostolosian use, these hefty hollows are designed for melee supremacy. Their bulky, reverse jointed legs allow them to explode with speed into close range (where they can do serious damage with their long heat glaives), or to hold their ground from incoming assaults (supported by the stock, circular shield each unit wields). The cost of this strength is a lack of versatility: Between the added articulation and pre-programmed combat routines required for the elaborate weapon use these hollows are known for, there simply wasn't room left for any serious ranged weaponry. Z-A Project Pneuma Prototype (for reference): The Pnuema is a model based on the basic design ethos first explored with the Z-A Kosmos. Instead of being focused on extreme close range, the Pneuma is meant to dominate the battlefield as a heavyweight, mid-range commander. Despite its increased scale, large ovoid vernier engines allow it a great deal of mobility, making it an intimidating machine to face--even more so when you take into account the fact that its heat glave has been affixed with a pump-action rocket launcher. Zenith-C Obscura (for reference) : Wide shoulders that lead down to treaded legs. Can launch dozens of drones into the air for reconnaissance and observation, which will quickly locate anything nearby, but must remain stationery to do that. Can launch micro missiles at locked targets, has small vulcans for infantry and small armored counter attack--does little to close range mechs. //Additional Notes\\\\ Primary Objectives : Prevent the High Altar (Point Ampersand) from being breached. If Attacked, escort Boole to Point Bracket for Extraction. Bonus Objective: Prevent the forward base at Point Comma from falling. This is where your long distance Strand Semaphore station is, along with long range scanners, Rules of Engagement Deployment of chemical, biological, and/or poisonous weapons: Even in the case of open combat, none of these weapons are to be used. We need to convince the Isles of Logos to joining up with us. Prisoners must be taken alive: We need intel, we need bargaining chips, and we need to show this world that we're just not the terrorists that we've been made out to be.

      "description": "For Kalar Anakalar and Phrygian, SBBR's newest recruits, it seemed like another boilerplate mission. A too-warm, too-quiet night in seaside town, making sure that the people in suits and dresses could go about their politicking and gallivanting in safety. But when Ver'Million Blue called in a strange occurrence at the Strand Semaphore station to the north of Auspice, they understood this would be no ordinary mission. But no warning would prepare these new recruits--or the rest of SBBR for that matter--for GLORY, and the hardest fight they'd faced yet.

Originally a steeplejack in Obelle and a member of a religious community devoted to the Divine Peace. Believes that Divines should not be used in war. Phrygian (they/them): Also known by their callsign, Deck 7, Phrygian is a member of the Branched who arrived on Partizan with a team of undercover researchers who sought to understand the God preached about by Gur Sevraq. While investigating, they and their team were captured and researched by Stel Apostolos and the Pact of Necessary Venture. Phyrgian is the only remaining member of their team. Cas'alear Rizah (cas/cas', they/them) : Leader of the Swordbreakers, sibling of the Glorious Princept. Cas has brown skin with dark green hair up in a bun, with a few strands hanging down in front of their face (which is framed with similarly colored scales covering cas' jawline and neck. Broken sword tattoos under their eyes. Reputation as being beautiful and brave by allies, unflinching and unpredictable by foes. Pilots the notorious Ataraxia. Cares more about metaphors than astrophysics. Boole Batanca (they/them): Chancellor of the Isle of Logos, one of two chief executives of the small sovereign nation. A cephalopod type species, squid-like species, the same as Gigas Acano from Twilight Mirage. White/blue skin with black/brown markings. Tentacle hands, tentacle mouth, eyes adjust in size depending on environment and light. Unlike Gigas, though, this one also has some sort of shell like structure running up their back and parts of their head, almost like hair. Laurel (they/them): Elect of Motion, new mortal leader of GLORY, and a clone of Cassander Timaeus Berenice, an Apostolosian war hero of the Golden era. Recently selected by Motion as her new elect, catapulting them to leadership. They have served well, with a remarkable propensity for strategic thinking and tactical execution. Pilots the Demiurgos. Sabeeha (they/them): Sabeeha is pound-for-pound GLORY's best pilot, though their specialities also include infiltration, disguise, and sabotage. Brown, light olive skin. Brown hair kept short and wavy, close to their head. Face and body both a little long, a little chubby. Big brown eyes. Slightly bushy brows. Pilots the Aporia. Vervain (they/them): Member of GLORY, clone of their Apostolosian tragic hero namesake, and a bright reflection of Ver'Million Blue. Using their Divine, the historic Vervain was able to predict enemy movements and turn the tide of battles with uncanny strategic foresight. Kleos (they/them): Skin is fully like a shiny maroon. Bright red cloak wrapped around neck and hanging back like a cape, totally topless otherwise. Khaki army pant capris, a spear slung over their back, and a heavy sidearm at their waist. Pilots the Epoche. Apothesa (they/them): Former field commander of GLORY's main Hallow unit. Supposedly a clone of the ancient (perhaps even mythical) eidolon of construction, military action, and history. They have big team-parent energy. Long wavy hair, perfectly kept pilot uniform, stern features, sterner attitude. Pilots the Aporia. //Places\\\\ Auspice: A seaside city in the Prophet's Path north of Marengo (which it is smaller than) and south of Obelle (which it dwarfs). Auspice is the final destination of the land travel portion of the yearly pilgrimage led by the Church of the Resin Heart, which has a great temple in the city called the High Altar. Resting on a landmass that appears on a map to be a finger pointing eastward, it has become a coastal refuge for members of Millennium Break. The Golden Branch: A sector of the galaxy extremely far from PARTIZAN, on the other side of the galactic core. The civilizations of Kesh and Apostolos first began there. Now, it is home to the Branched. //Divines\\\\ The Divine Motion (she/her): Long after enemy fuel tanks run empty, Motion continues to power Apostolosian machines of war (like its infamous retinue, the Black Century) and service (including the massive Barranca Loop that allows Apostolos to regularly launch ships spaceward). Ver'MIllion Blue's rival. Has taken a new elect, Laurel, a clone of the Apostolosian war hero Cassander Timaeus Berenice, a young, yet intuitive Apostolosian commander known to be attentive and authoritative in equal measure. //Things\\\\ Strand Semaphore: Using ancient Hyphan technology, this messenger service is able to send text-based communications to anywhere on-moon, so long as they've built an outpost there. The backbone of the private comms network used by Millennium Break. Ataraxia (Cas'alear's mech): A white, purple, and yellow mantid-shaped machine blessed by the divine Commitment and developed by Stel Columnar's Zenith Fund. Each of its six curved limbs can light up its edges with energy beams. On the ground, it can dance in combat in such a way that any two limbs can be its temporary feet, and when it's in flight, it becomes a complete whirlwind of violence. Named for the philosophical concept key to ancient Stoicism. The Demiurgos (aka \"The Demiurge,\" Laurel's mech): A Pneuma model (see below) which has been modified using cutting edge research and materials, including recovered parts of the supposed \"exemplar,\" Branched materials, stabilized Perennial Wave particles, and, of course, Motion's own divine power. Aponia (Sabeeha's Hallow): A highly modified Kosmos unit (see below) which is able to transforms into a high-mobility aircraft mode. Though it can be outfitted with a custom, solid-state rifle, this limits its maneuverability and flight length, so Sabeeha often chooses to leave the weapon behind, instead favoring the machine's built in energy blades, featured on its wings in flight mode, or extending from elbows and knees in humanoid forum. As a holdout weapon, this configuration also comes with energy-powered throwing blades. Katalepsis Mk. II (Vervain's Hallow): Like Milli's own Katalepsis, this model began as an exploration into combining features from both the Kosmos and the and the Obscura (see below for reference on both). Deep, dark teal with gold accents, rounded head shape built to scan its surroundings. Can launch dozens of drones into the air for reconnaissance and observation, which will quickly locate anything nearby, but must remain stationery to do that. Can launch micro missiles at locked targets from its shoulders. Its signature weapon is a huge V-shaped rifle that gives it a unique silhouette when attached to the Katalepsis' back. Because it is powered by Motion, the V Rifle is able to release incredible damaging energy attacks: Either in a devastating, short range spread when open, or as an incredible powerful long range railgun-like shot at range. Up close, Vervain can run this energy throughout the interior of the V's two \"blades,\" creating a unique, shear-like melee weapon. Epoché (Kleos' Hallow) A Kosmos unit highly modified for top-of-class melee functionality. Deep brown, triangular head headshape, humanoid machine with gold accents, and a faceplate made of brown stone, and heavy skirt plates to defend its upper legs/lower torso. A long, oval shield built onto it's left arm, a pair of grappling hook launchers on its skirt. Wields a guisarme--a spear that has a hook on the reverse side of the blade. The bottom of the weapon's shaft is weighted with a dense metal to allow for heavy clubbing attacks, and since the guisarme is able to split into two, connected by a long electrified cable, both the blade and club are able to be wielded simultaneously. Kleos is known to spin it around in a disorienting fashion and wield either side as a ranged weapon, using the electrified cable to disable anyone who gets caught up in the chain. Aporia (Apothesa's Hallow): A Kosmos unit retrofitted for high level defensive tactics. Able to deploy both physical walls and particle fields to block off areas of the battlefield. Additionally, wields a glaive and shotgun. Zenith-A Project Kosmos (for reference): Designed by the Columnar Zenith Fund for Apostolosian use, these hefty hollows are designed for melee supremacy. Their bulky, reverse jointed legs allow them to explode with speed into close range (where they can do serious damage with their long heat glaives), or to hold their ground from incoming assaults (supported by the stock, circular shield each unit wields). The cost of this strength is a lack of versatility: Between the added articulation and pre-programmed combat routines required for the elaborate weapon use these hollows are known for, there simply wasn't room left for any serious ranged weaponry. Z-A Project Pneuma Prototype (for reference): The Pnuema is a model based on the basic design ethos first explored with the Z-A Kosmos. Instead of being focused on extreme close range, the Pneuma is meant to dominate the battlefield as a heavyweight, mid-range commander. Despite its increased scale, large ovoid vernier engines allow it a great deal of mobility, making it an intimidating machine to face--even more so when you take into account the fact that its heat glave has been affixed with a pump-action rocket launcher. Zenith-C Obscura (for reference) : Wide shoulders that lead down to treaded legs. Can launch dozens of drones into the air for reconnaissance and observation, which will quickly locate anything nearby, but must remain stationery to do that. Can launch micro missiles at locked targets, has small vulcans for infantry and small armored counter attack--does little to close range mechs. //Additional Notes\\\\ Primary Objectives : Prevent the High Altar (Point Ampersand) from being breached.

      "description": "It has been just over fifty days since Millennium Break took Cruciat, and each day has been more busy than the last. The hammer of the Principality fell on the organization's independent cells across the moon, and now the leaders of Millennium Break seek allies wherever they can find them. No potential partner in the fight against tyranny is more important than the Isle of Logos. As a sovereign nation with key control in Partizan's great sea, the Isle could offer Millennium Break a literal port in troubled waters. And so, Gucci Garantine and Apparatus Aperitif have spent the better part of a month negotiating towards that end. Protecting these ever-moving negotiations has been trying, as SBBR can attest to. Even the quiet days, where nothing happens, require utmost focus and practiced determination. Yet they cannot hope for such a today to be such a day: One where the only red they see is that of the carpet rolled out for VIPs, where the only flash in their eyes comes from the cameras capturing the event. To the north, the air of Obelle cracks with the sound of artillery fire. But here in Auspice, Zo'la has finished their film, and it is due its audience. This week on PARTIZAN: The Grand Premiere ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Isle of Logos: An independent nation built by the followers of the prophet Logos Kantel's around their very first church. Though only a small handful of islands in the Prophet's Sea, the Isles keep a standing defense force that rivals any individual unit of the Major Stels. The Branched : A post-human society of beings who have transformed their bodies into forms terrifying and spectacular and free--only to have the threat of war force them to rebuild themselves as soldiers first and foremost. The Black Century: Infamous retinue of the Divine Motion. Each member of this 100-person company serves for 100 years. Motion guarantees them this service. The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of the prophet's religious mission. The \"resin heart\" in question is a 3-foot large object--a component of the Exemplar--pulled from the sea 400+ years ago and displayed as a relic by the Church. In mourning after the loss of Gur Sevraq, though still committed to the cause. //People\\\\ Break Lieutenant Kalar Anakalar (he/him): A Millennium Break soldier who specializes in fighting Hollows without one of his own.

      "description": "Content Warnings for this Episode Throughout: Violence During a Public Event 00:00 - 20:30: Disrespect of the Dead, Implied Disrespect of a Dead Body 1:41:00 - End: Death, Deliberation about Character Sacrifice, Suicide by Sacrifice, Immolation, Violence During a Public Event, Hey everyone, this has been a really heavy week: Wildfires across the western United States, Hurricane Laura in the Caribbean and gulf states, the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha and the murder of two Black Lives Matter protesters by Kyle Rittenhouse, all during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Given all of that, we wanted to be very upfront about the content of this week's episode, which is also a pretty heavy one. We stand in solidarity with those who are suffering right now--both under the weight of police brutality and natural disaster--, and we know that even natural disasters often cut hardest against those in the margins. So I hope you'll take a moment to consider helping those in need right now. Below are a small collection of links to funds or resources where you can figure out ways to support folks right now. We know this is an incomplete list, but we hope it's a start. Milwaukee Freedom Fund Northern California Wildfire Relief Resource Page Community Foundation of Southwest Louisiana Hurricane Relief Fund ---- Below the amber leaves of Goldcrown, masses gather to pay respect to a fallen hero who is more pyrite than gold. And above them, pallid yellow clouds gather in fallow anticipation of what is to come: An event worthy of the cenotaph's sobriquet. The whirring of aircraft blades to the east. The rumble of truck, unseen, to the west. And in the middle, SBBR, waiting to draw. This week on PARTIZAN: A Cemetery for Heroes //Organizations\\\\ The Knights of Order: Order towers over the world in both physicality and presence. Though it rests, without Elect, its blessed Hallows enact its will and search for one worthy to pilot it. //People\\\\ Crysanth Kesh (she/her) : Third in line to the throne of Kesh. As Gabardine of the Curtain of Divinity, Crysanth is the highest ranking member of the Curtain on Partizan. Brother Alard Cadmus : Knights of Order leader. Gruff, old, and determined, but understands Order better than any. Believes Order must be tamed . //Places\\\\ The Verglaz Taiga: Wrapped around the northern latitudes of Partizan, the Verglaz is a beauty to take in, at least from the comfort of the palatial Kesh estates which dot its wooded expanses. Soon after Millennium Break's capture of Cruciat, Kesh deployed what it and its allies in Nideo are calling a miracle that echoes those done by Logos Kantel one thousand years ago: the melting of the snows, and the emergence of a new, jungle biome, emerging from the rocky plains, snowy hills, and dense forests that were already in kesh territory. Nooncrown : A holy cemetery located in the Estatelands of Kesh, where many elects, Princepts, Eidolons, and other heroes from across the principality are buried and watched over by the Divine Order and its cult. Goldtown: An ad hoc village made that surrounds the southern half of Nooncrown, made up of Cruciat's exiled bourgeois class. //Divines\\\\ Order: A massive and slumbering Divine, part monument, part knight. Abhors chaos. Seeks an elect. //Things\\\\ Zenith-K Project Filigree : Delicate and light hollows, like leaves on the wind, built for long distance escort ops because they require little fuel and have low profiles. Humanoid with glider wings. Zenith-K Project Pinnacle : Humanoid knight-mechs, similar in many ways to the Zenith-A Project Kosmos units that were designed for Apostolos, though without the distinctive curves, rear-jointed legs, and Apostolosian style. Have spears bolted to their right underarms and close range blades under their left. The spears are able to be used as a projectile with a coiled cable, allowing for the spatial manipulation of enemy hollows. Memoria : A rare precious material with a high, natural storage capacity. Clarified Memoria : The Sable Court has developed a process by which they \"reveal\" the truth of Memoria gems, which allows the already potent material to conjure and confer the miraculous. The Eyes of the Exemplar: Special memoria that seem to be naturally clarified. Recovered from the now-abandoned Equiaxed Commune underneath Vigil City. //Additional Notes\\\\ Primary Objective: Prevent Kesh from retrieving the shipment of clarified memoria also known as \"The Eyes of the Exemplar.\" Secondary Objective: Successfully retrieve the Eyes of the Exemplar for Millennium Break. Rules of Engagement: Hurt none of the funeral's attendees. Do not wake Order, whatever you do.

      "description": "A month ago, Millennium Break seized control of Cruciat, ushering in a new age on the holy moon of Partizan. But like a counterpunch already chambered, the great Stels of the Divine Principality hit back with force and speed, driving minor Millennium Break bases into the dirt. Today, along with Cruciat, the only two strongholds left to the revolutionary group are the Lambic House and a trio of cities along the eastern edge of the Prophet's Path. Millennium Break must hold this ground, at all costs. And that is why, though they were one of the founders of the group, and its first executive elected, Valence's request for support in finding the parts of the Exemplar was denied. Even now, with actionable intel from their contact in Columnar, SBBR was being told that they'd need to go it alone. And with the memory of Gur Sevraq fresh in their minds, they saw no other option... This week on PARTIZAN: Buried Beneath Golden Leaves ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Knights of Order: Order towers over the world in both physicality and presence. Though it rests, without Elect, its blessed Hallows enact its will and search for one worthy to pilot it. //People\\\\ Jesset City (he/him) : Previously worked for Adamant Arms and Manufacturing, Jesset became full time Oxblood Clan lieutenant and then a major figure in Millennium Break. Expert technician, veteran hollow pilot, and Cipher Certified by Stel Nideo. Utilizes prostheses on his right arm, switching between an affordable myoelectric model with grip hooks and a custom model specifically designed for interfacing with a hollow cockpit. SBBR's CO for this mission. Gucci Garantine (she/her) : AKA Saint Dawn. Defector from Stel Kesh, controller of House Brightline and HORIZON's efforts on Partizan. Now a powerful member of Millennium Break's political class.. Crysanth Kesh (she/her) : Third in line to the throne of Kesh. As Gabardine of the Curtain of Divinity, Crysanth is the highest ranking member of the Curtain on Partizan. Brother Alard Cadmus : Knights of Order leader. Gruff, old, and determined, but understands Order better than any. Believes Order must be tamed . //Places\\\\ Oxbridge: Most bridges connect land to land, but the enormous Bridge of the Ox connects ocean ports to the docks of largest freshwater lake on the moon. Under the bridge rests Oxbridge, a dense city of canals and crimson light, and the first large scale Principality settlement to come to the moon, nearly 1000 years ago. Oxbridge is split into three regions: Brightsky West, Underbridge, and Brightsky East. To the East and West, merchants, nobles, and the ever-upwardly mobile live, work, shop and play. But below the bridge's shadow is an undercity of laborers both local and transient, eking by from job to job, day to day, by the fuel of their effort and the light of the red, phosphorescent \"lamps\" that give Underbridge its distinct glow, even in daytime. Connecting it all together are a network of waterways, roads, and secret tunnels. And above it all is the Bridge of the Ox, the symbol of Orion's commitment to (and mastery of) brute-force ideology. Deep Dish Steak House: A loyal bar. The Verglaz Taiga: Wrapped around the northern latitudes of Partizan, the Verglaz is a beauty to take in, at least from the comfort of the palatial Kesh estates which dot its wooded expanses.

Zenith-K Project Pinnacle : Humanoid knight-mechs, similar in many ways to the Zenith-A Project Kosmos units that were designed for Apostolos, though without the distinctive curves, rear-jointed legs, and Apostolosian style. Have spears bolted to their right underarms and close range blades under their left. The spears are able to be as a projectile with a coiled cable, allowing for the spatial manipulation of enemy hollows. //Additional Notes\\\\ Primary Objective: Prevent Kesh from retrieving the shipment of clarified memoria also known as \"The Eyes of the Exemplar.\" Secondary Objective: Successfully retrieve the Eyes of the Exemplar for Millennium Break. Rules of Engagement: Hurt none of the funeral's attendees. Do not wake Order, whatever you do.

      "description": "Hey everyone, welcome to a very special bonus episode of Friends at the Table. As we said on Twitter, we're currently taking a few weeks off after the end of Kingdom to catch up on things, prep for the rest of PARTIZAN, and generally tak ea break. Many of us here on the show have spent some of that break by playing Blaseball , the internet sensation that VICE's Gita Jackson describes as \"an online, joke-y, facsimile of [baseball] ... about baseball fandom, and the bullshit that goes along with it.\" It's an absolute blast, and because so many of us were getting into it, Art had the great idea of wanting to sponsor a season or two of the game. So, he reached out, we chatted with the folks behind Blaseball (though we didn't get to meet the commissioner himself), and here we are. If you are just joining us for the first time as a fan of Blaseball who doesn't know anything about us, we hope this episode is an enjoyable introduction into the sort of stories we tell and games we play. If you're a fan of ours who is itching for more PARTIZAN, well, I hope this visit to a figure from the past helps sate that thirst. If you'd like to check out Sports Are Just Numerology by Ben Roswell, the game we play in this bonus episode, you can do that by clicking right here . We'll be taking this week and potentially next week off, but please look forward to our return. Have some great stuff in the can already. Until then, be safe, have fun, and go Millennials!

      "description": "For those who live under tyranny, the exhaustion and fear is such that it can be hard to even imagine or recognize what escape or progress or revolution look like. But when Icebreaker Prime came over the horizon, the citizens of Cruciat, beaten down by generations of chic, high-minded Kesh terror, knew exactly what they were looking at. Millennium Break. Cruciat was all but undefended, with the bulk of Kesh's forces engaged with Motion her Apostlosian forces to the west--an attack they would not have anticipated if not for late coming intelligence from an Apostolosian traitor. Now, the revolution had to make a final decision in this first stretch of what would surely be a decades long campaign: Was it time to make a definitive strike. To take not just any city, but the city a Princept sometimes calls home. The city where the prisoners turned radicals of the Rapid Evening were once held. Where knowledge is locked away from those that need it most. Where hierarchy is woven into the streets themselves. The question on everyone's minds wasn't what the cost would be if Millennium Break took Cruciat. It was what it would be if they didn't. This week on PARTIZAN: The Storm Over Cruciat ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Curtain of Divinity: Though Kesh is technically governed through an elaborate parliamentary democracy, the truth is that The Curtain of Divinity, a secretive organization inside of the Stel (and with agents across all of the Principality), serves as the actual power behind the throne. Knowledge of the Curtain is carefully guarded, and its membership is even further protected. Was originally established to rein in the Principality's most tyrannical institutions and encourage growth and equity over generations, while hiding the truth of what lied beyond the Scutum-Centaurus Portcullis. Over time, their more noble aims were eroded, and only this final goal remained, along with a much more selfish goal of controlling the state. Is currently in a covert war against the Pact of Necessary Venture. The Pact of Necessary Venture : Though they trace their lineage back to an exploratory committee founded in the late 14th century of the Perfect Millenium, the Pact was not made in earnest until five years ago in 1418 PM, soon after hostilities began between Kesh and Apostolos. It's original leadership committee, Plumeria, Gallica, Myosotis, Rye, and Hyacinth determined that to ensure the future stability of the Principality, the Pact would establish a power base in the Scutum–Centaurus arm, amass a vast fleet using the unexploited resources there, and sweep both princepts out of power, replacing the role with a five-part council representing each Stel equally. Each was an elect: Plumeria the elect of Past, Gallica of Present, Myosotis of Future, Rye of Space, and Hyacinth of Motion. Plumeria and Myosotis were killed during Gur Sevraq's theft of the Divine Future. Plumeria's successor, Cymbidium, was killed when Past crashed into the sands of the Prophet's Path. Hyacinth was killed in combat by the Rapid Evening, but has already been replaced. The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of the prophet's religious mission. The \"resin heart\" in question is a 3-foot large object pulled from the sea 400+ years ago and displayed as a relic by the Church. It was originally part of the Exemplar. Millennium Break: Dissidents, idealogues, rebels, and mercenaries launch a revolution from a state-of-the-art mobile fortress. They agree on little, except this: It is time for a new Millennium. Strand Semaphore: Using ancient Hyphan technology, this messenger service is able to send text-based communications to anywhere on-moon, so long as they've built an outpost there. The backbone of the private comms network used by Millennium Break. Lambic House: A group of beer-brewing monks who both operate a brewery and manage a sizable civilian settlement deep in the mountains of the Pique Ridge. Part of the Shepherd's Crook. HORIZON: In the popular consciousness, HORIZON is a radical, anti-Principality terrorist organization. In actuality, they are a radical-reformist group, which seeks to drive out what it perceives as corruption in an empire that ought be pursuing noble (instead of selfish) ends. Rumored to be funded by Stel Kesh's House Brightline. The Mysteries Metronomica/ \"Metronomica\"/\"The Cult of Perennial\" : Guided by the paradoxical belief in historical cycles and radical freedom, the Isles of Logos offers this faith of the Adversary, Perennial, perhaps the only safe ground in the entire galaxy. The Red Fennecs: Technically, the Red Fennecs are an Apostolosian logistics and transport squad. In actuality, they're utilized by their commanding officer, Tes'ili Serikos, as the backbone of a humble smuggling operation. The Sable Court: Some say that on dark nights, they have seen these Ashen witches on the eastern edge of Lake Timea, horns and antlers glittering in the light of Girandole. Some even say that a former elect walks among them. Heresy, all of it. Company of the Spade: A veteran mercenary unit founded by space miners who learned how to pilot Hollows in the most dangerous of settings. They've been brought to Partizan to combine both types of expertise. The Oxblood Clan : What started as a group of orphans turned into a labor guild and criminal enterprise with connections across Partizan. Occasionally run rough-and-tumble military ops for extra cash. Allies with SBBR. //People\\\\ The Peaceful Princept (he/him): Born Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh, The Peaceful Princept is one of two current pretenders to the title. He was not meant to inherit the position, but instead was thrust into it as part of Stel Kesh's attempt to hold onto the title after Dahlia defected to Stel Apostolos. When he was still \"only\" Cynosure Kesh, he was a mediocre negotiator of economic policy (notably losing ground to Stel Orion's Rye, elect of Space, during the Kesh-Coronet Trade Dispute of 1390) and an even more mediocre poet (having written the much panned collection \"In All Days the Sun Second\"). He is attending the Summer Passage of Arms. Both The Curtain and the Pact of Necessary Venture hope to manipulate him in order to better secure their power. The Glorious Princept (they/them): The second pretender to the title of Princept. Born to house Kesh and current Apokine of Stel Apostolos, they are known to many as simply 'Dahlia. Unlike Cynosure, Dahlia is a beloved leader who has proven themselves in court and on the battlefield in the ongoing war against the Branched far from the moon of Partizan. At the same time, they wage war against Stel Kesh and promise to bring to light misdeeds perpetrated by the Principality against the Apostolosian people. Though they are not at the Summer Passage this year, in the year of their majority, they attended as a competitor and won six events, sweeping the Passage and gaining the title \"The Six-Fold Champion.\" Kueen Overture \"K.O.\" Rooke (she/her): SBBR's contact at the Scrivener's Guild. A former ace pilot, lead mechanic, and battlefield commander, KO now uses her expertise to dispatch and guide mercenary units across Partizan as a broker in the Scrivener's Guild. Mother of Audacious Opportunity (\"A.O.\") Rooke. Crysanth Kesh (she/her) : Clementine Kesh's mother. Third in line to the throne of Kesh. As Gabardine of the Curtain of Divinity, Crysanth is the highest ranking member of the Curtain on Partizan. Cas'alear Rizah (cas/cas', they/them) : Leader of the Swordbreakers. Cas has brown skin with dark green hair up in a bun, with a few strands hanging down in front of their face (which is framed with similarly colored scales covering cas' jawline and neck. Broken sword tattoos under their eyes. Reputation as being beautiful and brave by allies, unflinching and unpredictable by foes. Pilots the notorious Ataraxia. Apparatus Aperitif (they/them): Logos City, the largest independent city on Partizan, is known as a religious center, but its robotic night mayor ensures that everyone has a good time at the end of their time traveling the Prophet's Path. Representative of the Mysteries Metronomica onboard Icebreaker Prime. Gur Sevraq (he/them): Leader of the Church of the Resin Heart. Miracle worker. Currently on board Icebreaker Prime. Has possession of the Divine Future, which gives them startling prescience and the ability to imagine futures outside of the confines of the hegemonic and imperialist world around him. Si'dra Balos (Si/Si's, they/them): During their time in a communications division of the Apostolosian Navy, Si'dra saw the cost of war first hand. Now they dream of a world where people can connect instead of fight. Tes'ili Serikos (they/them, tes/tes') : This Apostolosian transport specialist, black marketeer, and Tes'ili Serikos can get just about anything just about anywhere, for a price. Short, round, fuzzy, and good natured… unless you screw tes over. The Blossom (he/him): The Lambic House is just supposed to make beer, sell it around the world, and keep people happy. But with each keg delivered by the sect's Abbot of Provision, the Blossom also serves a short, populist whisper. Zo'la (zo/zo's, they/them): As a projection artists, Zo'la seeks to create a cinematic work that captures the dynamic spirit of this historical moment. Born to Columnar, then drawn to the Apostlosian ideology of Dynamism (which values speed, change, and violence above all else. A wildcard and a vanguard. Friends with Gucci Garantine, despite having spent time on opposite sides of the Kesh/Apostolos war. Agon Ortlights (she/her): Aided by her servicebot companions, Agon worked hard to attain the rank of lieutenant in the Company of the Spade, where she's become a veteren mercenary, a skilled miner, and a hell of a drinking buddy. A.O. Rooke (he/him): Former Stel Orion mercenary, now commander of the Rapid Evening's \"toughs\" squad. Eiden Teak (he/him) : Soldier and commander in the Sable Court. Wears the wounds of past fights on him with a distinct sort of pride, inherited from his time fighting as an Apostolosian soldier: He's missing right leg under the knee, and a number of his antlers have been snapped and broken. Wears loose olive drab fatigues, marked the occult insignia and wards of the Court. Mourningbride (she/her): An initiate in the Sable Court, and a former Elect. Alise Breka (she/her): Guest lecturer at Verglaz University and Author of popular Renegade Hearts pulp series, which tells stories of daring and romantic Hallow pilots. On Partizan to research her next book, partly by interviewing the imprisoned pirate Exeter Leap. //Places\\\\ The Prophet's Sea: A massive ocean that dominates the center of most maps of Partizan. It is said that the sea was made by the prophet Logos Kantel in their first miracle, after walking the length of its radius and climbing a set of hills that would soon become islands. The Verglaz Taiga: Wrapped around the northern latitudes of Partizan, the Verglaz is a beauty to take in, at least from the comfort of the palatial Kesh estates which dot its wooded expanses. From the smaller villages and towns, where feudal tenants huddle for warmth in the snow, whatever aesthetic pleasure the taiga may offer the rich is lost. In the south west, though, a new source of warmth has made its presence known: The burning engine of the Apostolosian war machine, which melts the ice away with artillery barrage and crashed mech, both. Cruciat: The Jewel of Kesh's holdings on Partizan (and the home of the Stel's Winter Palace) sits on a cross shaped island in the northernmost reaches of the Prophet's Sea The Winter Palace : Owned and managed by House Kesh, but eternal \"home\" to the Princept, whether they choose to visit or not. Built for privacy and access, featuring both its own port and trainyard. Westhaven : Kesh's military might is most centered in this province, which stretches across its westmost ports and up against its border with chief rival, Apostolos. \"Westhaven stands so that we may serve dinner in the palace.\" The Estatelands : The southeastern taiga, where the climate is most temperate and the tall trees stand closely together, is home to the dozens of noble families who rule Kesh's lands on Partizan. Miles of canopy suddenly broken by vast, cleared and pruned acreage. The North Gallery: Decades before Museum Row was an established destination, the North Gallery collected art about and ephemera from Kesh's original colonization of the Verglaz Taiga on Partizan. //Things\\\\ Icebreaker Prime: A massive arsenal, garrison, airfield, and a firebase all rolled into one. Icebreaker Prime is a rumbling carrier which prowls land and sea, armed with innumerable weapons and potentially housing over ten thousand soldiers. Currently, Icebreaker Prime is under the command of Clementine Kesh and the Rapid Evening, and is hidden in the most unperturbed waters of the Prophet's Sea. \"Autonomy Itself\"/\"The True Divine\"/The God of the Nobel/The God of Logos Kantel (they/them): Granted the power to transform Partizan into a living world to Logos Kantel 1000 years ago. Guided the Nobel and other cultures in the Scutum-Centaurus arm through the course of their history. A God of becoming, not being, process, not finality. Their origin is unknown, sometimes debated, but rarely considered important to their devotees, who care more about Their current divinity rather than the circumstances by which it was arrived at. The phrases \"the True Divine\" and \"Autonomy Itself\" are found in some Progressive Asterists texts and doctrine, but also across heterodox and heretical religious creeds and in the teachings of gnostic and esoteric secret societies. The Exemplar : \"God's Divine.\" Originally built 1000 years ago, now spread in \"parts\" across the moon. Its beating heart was left in the sea. It's countless eyes buried under the Memoria Teardrop. Its blood runs through the springs of the Pique Ridge. Its powerful voice echoes through the windswept canyons of the Barranca. And, perhaps, something else trapped below the ice in the northern reaches of Kesh territory in the Verglaz Taiga. Bing 32: Broun's floating, cat sized drone able to use a variety of tools. Now mass produced for use across Millennium Break. //Additional Notes\\\\ Crossroads Crossroad #1: Will The Kingdom allow civilian refugees to live on Icebreaker Prime? Crossroad #2: Will the Kingdom rob the surreptitious Columnar and Orion arms shipments in order to address our resource problem? Crossroad #3: Will the Kingdom hold elections? Crossroad #4: Will the Kingdom put counterrevolutionaries on trial? Crossroad #5: Will The Kingdom accept the aid of the Pact of Necessary Venture in the form of a secure island, from which MB can expand their operation and farm food safe from the crisis? Crossroad #6: Will The Kingdom invade Vigil City in order to rescue the Equiaxed Commune there? Crossroad #7: Will The Kingdom participate in the Summer Passage of Arms? Crossroad #8: Will the Kingdom invade Cruciat? The Millenium Break Manifesto We will help those displaced by the war on Partizan We will claim supplies only when it adds losses to the ledgers of the unjust. Free and Fair elections will be held every two years. Burn thrones, build tables. When we provide for ourselves, we can provide for others. We will not turn our backs on allies in need. If you must play their game, make sure to bloody their noses. Character Bonds Valence : I feel the uncomfortable draw of the unknown from Apparatus, but must keep focus on the revolution and the way of God. An overindulgence of curiosity would sidetrack me. Apparatus : Gur Sevraq has always been a bit of a Day Mayor. I hope he has not gotten too used to the light. Gur Sevraq : Milli is right to distrust all who seek to direct her power, but she ought fight for those who share her dreams yet lack her strength. Milli : Sovereign Immunity's connections could get us out of prison. I need to make sure this summit doesn't make him forget that. SI : This is the moment Clementine must show her mettle as a leader. If she is truly a frivolous child I will find someone better. Clem : United, Gucci and I could be a powerful force for Kesh, with me at its head. Her misplaced egalitarianism, however, is a problem. Gucci : Broun knows how to get things done and I know what they want in return. But there's a difference between service and loyalty, and I don't know when or where they'll draw that line. Broun : I need Valence to keep their promise to me but I don't believe they can.

      "description": "However the Summer Passage of Arms--a yearly competition of strength, skill, acumen, and style--began, it has followed in the fate of many similar comptetitons prior and become a proxy for nationalistic fervor. On the Isle of Summer in the Prophet's Sea, all five Great Stels gather to test each other in a host of events. Commenters often say that the games bring out \"the best of the Principality.\" This is true, though perhaps more true--and obvious through its omission--it is the case that the Passage serves to hide the worst of the Principality, too. The winner earns glory, but each Stel--even those currently at war with each other--also seeks something else through their simple presence at the games: To convince the world that this is what 'civilization' looks like. At home, the Stels drive their boots into the backs of their most vulnerable citizens. But here on the beautiful Isle of Summer, they gather in the name of fair and even conflict on an agreed upon battleground to see who is the noblest of them all. This week on PARTIZAN: She Said, \"To Win We Must Play!\" ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Summer Passage of Arms: The Summer Passage is as much an event as an organization, a committee that holds a yearly competition of athletics, martial prowess, cultural acumen, and all else expected in a hero of the Divine Principality. As such, each Stel serves as patron to an official team, though smaller organizations (Progressive Asterist churches,Stel Orion corporations, Columnar regional funds, etc.) are known to send their own teams. As Partizan is the rare place where all five Stels meet, the event is held on the moon yearly, with results shared (albeit slowly) across the whole of the Principality. Though key events change from Summer to Summer, they often include an element of hollow proficiency. In this year's event, sponsored teams are required to compete across hollow wrestling, synchronized sharp shooting, poetry, the biathlon, and the Divine Providence, a race and obstacle course that tests each competitors endurance and agility. Though they are not official events, patrons are also encouraged to participate through a general display of style, and a non-ranked demonstration of spear technique. The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of the prophet's religious mission. The \"resin heart\" in question is a 3-foot large object pulled from the sea 400+ years ago and displayed as a relic by the Church. It was originally part of the Exemplar.

      "description": "With its internal threats sorted, at least for now, Millennium Break's de facto leaders shift the bulk of their attention outward. As rebellion is sparked across Partizan, a new question takes center stage: If Millennium Break wants to lead this revolutionary moment, does it need to step out into the light of day? Who can they save if they take this risk? And who do they put in harms way if they refuse to rise to the challenge? As a dire situation develops in the Memoria Teardrop, it becomes clear that these are not hypothetical questions. A decision must be made. This week on PARTIZAN: Breaking Vigil ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Vigil City Equiaxed Commune: Across Columnar space, the Equiaxed--a culture of people who augment their synthetic frames with living, organic materials for a variety of reasons--are persecuted, outlawed, arrested, and even experimented on. One way that this vulnerable and targeted group has found some peace is to live together in communal living spaces, where they can support each other emotionally and materially, sharing skills, resources, and information. One such group is the Commune at Vigil City, which is located towards the Northern edge of the city's reaches. There is a massive cavern underneath a dreary office park, and the structures that stretch above also delve below. It is a vertically-hanging housing project, each tower a stalactite filled with lives. And around it all, shimmering memoria like one thousand thousand eyes in the dark: A resource that Stel Columnar would do anything to get hold of. 301st Appraisal Unit : Before the Columnar commits the resources necessary to take something for their own, this small reconnaissance unit comprised of soldiers, engineers, and academics needs to find it The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of the prophet's religious mission. The \"resin heart\" in question is a 3-foot large object pulled from the sea 400+ years ago and displayed as a relic by the Church. It was originally part of the Exemplar. Millennium Break: Dissidents, idealogues, rebels, and mercenaries launch a revolution from a state-of-the-art mobile fortress. They agree on little, except this: It is time for a new Millennium. Strand Semaphore: Using ancient Hyphan technology, this messenger service is able to send text-based communications to anywhere on-moon, so long as they've built an outpost there. Lambic House: A group of beer-brewing monks who both operate a brewery and manage a sizable civilian settlement deep in the mountains of the Pique Ridge. Part of the Shepherd's Crook. HORIZON: In the popular consciousness, HORIZON is a radical, anti-Principality terrorist organization. In actuality, they are a radical-reformist group, which seeks to drive out what it perceives as corruption in an empire that ought be pursuing noble (instead of selfish) ends. Rumored to be funded by Stel Kesh's House Brightline. The Mysteries Metronomica/ \"Metronomica\"/\"The Cult of Perennial\" : Guided by the paradoxical belief in historical cycles and radical freedom, the Isles of Logos offers this faith of the Adversary, Perennial, perhaps the only safe ground in the entire galaxy. The Red Fennecs: Technically, the Red Fennecs are an Apostolosian logistics and transport squad. In actuality, they're utilized by their commanding officer, Tes'ili Serikos, as the backbone of a humble smuggling operation. The Sable Court: Some say that on dark nights, they have seen these Ashen witches on the eastern edge of Lake Timea, horns and antlers glittering in the light of Girandole. Some even say that a former elect walks among them. Heresy, all of it. Company of the Spade: A veteran mercenary unit founded by space miners who learned how to pilot Hollows in the most dangerous of settings. They've been brought to Partizan to combine both types of expertise. The Oxblood Clan : What started as a group of orphans turned into a labor guild and criminal enterprise with connections across Partizan. Occasionally run rough-and-tumble military ops for extra cash. Allies with SBBR. //People\\\\ Kenzington \"Kenzi\" Be (she/her) : Commanding Officer of the Columnar 301st Appraisal Unit. Has legs that can fold down into tank treds--in some ways, she looks like the humanoid version of Broun's mech, the Three Cheers! Has a long oval torso and a totally spherical head with dozens of cameras on it that sort of extends from her torso. Quintessence \"Tessence\" Rey (he/him): A young member of the secret Equiaxed commune in Vigil City, Tessence is the community's only remaining military defender. In his custom Kosmos unit, he has helped defend his family and friends from Columnar aggression numerous times. He did, however, have a card up his sleeve: An EDICT system, kept in operating condition since the time of the Divine Clash, through a combination of cleverness, effort, and good luck. Apparatus Aperitif (they/them): Logos City, the largest independent city on Partizan, is known as a religious center, but its robotic night mayor ensures that everyone has a good time at the end of their time traveling the Prophet's Path. Representative of the Mysteries Metronomica onboard Icebreaker Prime. Gur Sevraq (he/them): Leader of the Church of the Resin Heart. Miracle worker. Currently on board Icebreaker Prime. Has possession of the Divine Future, which gives them startling prescience and the ability to imagine futures outside of the confines of the hegemonic and imperialist world around him. Si'dra Balos (Si/Si's, they/them): During their time in a communications division of the Apostolosian Navy, Si'dra saw the cost of war first hand. Now they dream of a world where people can connect instead of fight. Tes'ili Serikos (they/them, tes/tes') : This Apostolosian transport specialist, black marketeer, and Tes'ili Serikos can get just about anything just about anywhere, for a price. Short, round, fuzzy, and good natured… unless you screw tes over. The Blossom (he/him): The Lambic House is just supposed to make beer, sell it around the world, and keep people happy. But with each keg delivered by the sect's Abbot of Provision, the Blossom also serves a short, populist whisper. Zo'la (zo/zo's, they/them): As a projection artists, Zo'la seeks to create a cinematic work that captures the dynamic spirit of this historical moment. Born to Columnar, then drawn to the Apostlosian ideology of Dynamism (which values speed, change, and violence above all else. A wildcard and a vanguard. Friends with Gucci Garantine, despite having spent time on opposite sides of the Kesh/Apostolos war. Agon Ortlights (she/her): Aided by her servicebot companions, Agon worked hard to attain the rank of lieutenant in the Company of the Spade, where she's become a veteren mercenary, a skilled miner, and a hell of a drinking buddy. A.O. Rooke (he/him): Former Stel Orion mercenary, now commander of the Rapid Evening's \"toughs\" squad. Eiden Teak (he/him) : Soldier and commander in the Sable Court. Wears the wounds of past fights on him with a distinct sort of pride, inherited from his time fighting as an Apostolosian soldier: He's missing right leg under the knee, and a number of his antlers have been snapped and broken. Wears loose olive drab fatigues, marked the occult insignia and wards of the Court. Mourningbride (she/her): An initiate in the Sable Court, and a former Elect. Alise Breka (she/her): Guest lecturer at Verglaz University and Author of popular Renegade Hearts pulp series, which tells stories of daring and romantic Hallow pilots. On Partizan to research her next book, partly by interviewing the imprisoned pirate Exeter Leap. //Places\\\\ The Memoria Teardrop: A range of mountains and high plains, dense with mineral resources. Named for \"memoria,\" a rare precious material with a high, natural storage capacity. Vigil City: The capital city of Stel Columnar on Partizan. Sits on the southern end of the \"Teardrop\" on a high plateau. The densest city on Partizan, Vigil City is also the most automated city on the moon. The Prophet's Sea: A massive ocean that dominates the center of most maps of Partizan. It is said that the sea was made by the prophet Logos Kantel in their first miracle, after walking the length of its radius and climbing a set of hills that would soon become islands. Marengo: Oxbridge's biggest rival to the far west of Orion territory, Marengo borders the Prophet's Path and because of that has been favored by three groups: faithful hoping to draw on the strength of passing pilgrims; traders eager to take tourist coin; and criminals who like the proximity of uncontrolled territory. Auspice: A seaside city in the Prophet's Path north of Marengo (which it is smaller than) and south of Obelle (which it dwarfs). Auspice is the final destination of the land travel portion of the yearly pilgrimage led by the Church of the Resin Heart. Resting on a landmass that appears on a map to be a finger pointing eastward, it has become a coastal refuge for members of Millennium Break. //Divines\\\\ The Divine Asepsis : Vigil City is the densest urban settlement on the moon, and yet, every morning, it is spotless. Give thanks to Asepsis' swarm of robotic servants. //Things\\\\ Icebreaker Prime: A massive arsenal, garrison, airfield, and a firebase all rolled into one. Icebreaker Prime is a rumbling carrier which prowls land and sea, armed with innumerable weapons and potentially housing over ten thousand soldiers. Currently, Icebreaker Prime is under the command of Clementine Kesh and the Rapid Evening, and is hidden in the most unperturbed waters of the Prophet's Sea. Zugzwang: The state of play in Chess when one play is forced to make moves to their own disadvantage. EDICT System : The E lectronic D ivine I nterface and C ontrol T echnology System was originally deployed during the Divine Clash, over 2400 years ago. Requires a great deal of power to activate, and needs to be transported by multiple large trucks, but when it is used, it can badly disrupt Divine activity--at least most of the time. There are many theories as to which Divines are affected and why, with many believing it is determined by provenance or era of Divine, some internal system of the EDICT itself, or even the current condition of the Perennial Wave. AdArm Troop: Designed by The de facto \"grunt\" mech of the Divine Principality. 55~ feet tall bipedal hollow, mid sized but bulky in aesthetic. Blocky, visible cabling. Head is a rectangular unit (with a long, flat LED-lit single \"eye\") that functions as a sensor suite, and attached to its right (above the shoulder) is a heavy cannon. Left arm has actuator/clasper, right has bayonet. Panther: An ancient mech once piloted by a near mythological hero of a war barely remembered. Medium sized, black, humanoid, angular, and birdlike in some elements of its design. In another life, it could split itself up into independently flying microwings, each of which could serve as a flanking weapon. Its current pilot can not conceive of using it in this way. Formerly piloted by Clementine Kesh. Blessed by Future. Three Cheers! : Kal'mera Broun's hollow, a heavily modified Adamant Arms and Artifice (aka AdArm) machine. Humanoid with the ability to take a mobility form. Equipped for long range volleying. Easily removable/replaceable plates with non-standard rivets. Heads Up : Exeter Leap's hallow, a re-fitted Emergentec Rapid Response Type III Breaching Ambulance which he has converted for criminal purposes. Large cylindrical legs taper upwards towards the head. Armored fists and a back mounted mortar. Blessed by Future. Mow: A recovered Zenith-A Project Eudaimonia prototype model. The build of a gorilla, quadrupedal & topheavy, a saddle horn-like addition on the back, battered but lovingly maintained. Stray Dog : Million's hollow, a Zenith-A Project Katalepsis prototype model, stolen when she went AWOL from GLORY. Medium-sized and humanoid in base shape, but able to rearrange its body to accommodate the rail gun built into the torso and left arm. Each limb is double jointed with sleek black and silver plating. There is only one glowing eye on the head, which houses the Stray Dog's aiming systems and pilot. Blessed by Future. Transgress Oblige : The hollow of Gucci Garantine, and a chief symbol of the terrorist organization Horizon. Whitesmoke color body, with the torso, shoulders, and upper arms covered in a sort of secondary armor layer that is blue with gold flourishes. Carries a bazooka and a pair of beam partizan (with a golden beam blade) which can retract into a beam saber. Below the blue armor layer is a secondary core, made of some sort of rare crystal: When revealed, those that see it are struck by the power and magnificence of humanity itself. Hippocampus : Valence's hollow, an AdArm Prototype Loveliness. A small, ovoid cockpit that has two \"chicken legs\" attached to it. Helicopter blades fold out from inside the cockpit and onto the top of the mech to give it basic flight. Old Glory: Sovereign Immunity's hallow, a modified Singh Sisters Wheel Service & Heavy Industry Ltd. \"Deltoid\" model. Used for rapid agricultural construction, able to create small shelters in minutes, and large modular structures in a matter of hours instead of days. Able to rapidly create barricades with large construction panels. Wields a spike-planting gun and a scythe, the latter of which was appropriated from an agricultural hollow. Once featured the icon of the Shepherd's Crook, but this was melted by a flamethrower, then removed, leaving behind the negative space of the symbol instead of a scorch mark. Blessed by Future. //Additional Notes\\\\ Crossroads Crossroad #1: Will The Kingdom allow civilian refugees to live on Icebreaker Prime?

      "description": "A week away from the moon of Partizan, a vessel rare in its luxury and power orbited the Portcullis which connects this provincial system to the rest of the empire. Inside, the living leaders of the Pact of Necessary Venture conferred with the sort of secrecy afforded only to the truly powerful. Their question: What was to be done about Millennium Break? On paper, the two groups had great reason to despise each other: Gur Sevraq had robbed the Pact of a Divine, killing its elect and a former elect of Past in the process. The Pact had attacked Valence's homeworld, and disregarded the authority of the True Divine. Motion had been bested by the Rapid Evening, and found herself a rival in Ver'Million Blue--a rivalry felt in the jealous heart of Motion's new elect, a young, yet intuitive Apostolosian commander known to be attentive and authoritative in equal measure. And yet, it was clear that the group was a potential ally in the struggle against the Princepts' endless war and the Principality's outmoded system of governance. But should the Pact offer quiet support? Should they go public and join the Break in the trenches? Perhaps they should simply infiltrate the group and help shape them towards the Pact's needs. It was Gallica, elect of Present, who determined the plan of action, and Gallica, thus, who would deliver the offer. The only question was whether Millennium Break understood the precarious position they rested in well enough to make the right decision. This week on PARTIZAN: Courage in the Shadow of Opportunity ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Pact of Necessary Venture : Though they trace their lineage back to an exploratory committee founded in the late 14th century of the Perfect Millenium, the Pact was not made in earnest until five years ago in 1418 PM, soon after hostilities began between Kesh and Apostolos. It's original leadership committee, Plumeria, Gallica, Myosotis, Rye, and Hyacinth determined that to ensure the future stability of the Principality, the Pact would establish a power base in the Scutum–Centaurus arm, amass a vast fleet using the unexploited resources there, and sweep both princepts out of power, replacing the role with a five-part council representing each Stel equally. Each was an elect: Plumeria the elect of Past, Gallica of Present, Myosotis of Future, Rye of Space, and Hyacinth of Motion. Plumeria and Myosotis were killed during Gur Sevraq's theft of the Divine Future. Plumeria's successor, Cymbidium, was killed when Past crashed into the sands of the Prophet's Path. Hyacinth was killed in combat by the Rapid Evening, but has already been replaced. The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of the prophet's religious mission. The \"resin heart\" in question is a 3-foot large object pulled from the sea 400+ years ago and displayed as a relic by the Church. It was originally part of the Exemplar. Millennium Break: Dissidents, idealogues, rebels, and mercenaries launch a revolution from a state-of-the-art mobile fortress. They agree on little, except this: It is time for a new Millennium. Strand Semaphore: Using ancient Hyphan technology, this messenger service is able to send text-based communications to anywhere on-moon, so long as they've built an outpost there. Lambic House: A group of beer-brewing monks who both operate a brewery and manage a sizable civilian settlement deep in the mountains of the Pique Ridge. Part of the Shepherd's Crook. HORIZON: In the popular consciousness, HORIZON is a radical, anti-Principality terrorist organization. In actuality, they are a radical-reformist group, which seeks to drive out what it perceives as corruption in an empire that ought be pursuing noble (instead of selfish) ends. Rumored to be funded by Stel Kesh's House Brightline. The Mysteries Metronomica/ \"Metronomica\"/\"The Cult of Perennial\" : Guided by the paradoxical belief in historical cycles and radical freedom, the Isles of Logos offers this faith of the Adversary, Perennial, perhaps the only safe ground in the entire galaxy.

Occasionally run rough-and-tumble military ops for extra cash. Allies with SBBR. //People\\\\ Gallica (she/her): Elect of the Divine Present, Chief Emissary of Stel Nideo, Verse (missionary) in the Holy Church of Received Asterism, signatory of the Pact of Necessary Venture, and Anodyne of all Divinity. Gallica has spent the last five years living, in effect, as a double agent. Her role as a Verse of Received Asterism and Nidean Emissary is to ensure unity among the Stels and repair the harm done to Stel Nideo's reputation by The Farmer. But she simultaneously has sown discord against the Princepts, aided in the creation of the Pact's shadow fleets, and made herself a great deal of profit in the process. Because of Present's unique abilities, she is the most traveled mortal being in the Divine Principality. Apparatus Aperitif (they/them): Logos City, the largest independent city on Partizan, is known as a religious center, but its robotic night mayor ensures that everyone has a good time at the end of their time traveling the Prophet's Path. Representative of the Mysteries Metronomica onboard Icebreaker Prime. Gur Sevraq (he/them): Leader of the Church of the Resin Heart. Miracle worker. Currently on board Icebreaker Prime. Has possession of the Divine Future, which gives them startling prescience and the ability to imagine futures outside of the confines of the hegemonic and imperialist world around him. Si'dra Balos (Si/Si's, they/them): During their time in a communications division of the Apostolosian Navy, Si'dra saw the cost of war first hand. Now they dream of a world where people can connect instead of fight. Tes'ili Serikos (they/them, tes/tes') : This Apostolosian transport specialist, black marketeer, and Tes'ili Serikos can get just about anything just about anywhere, for a price. Short, round, fuzzy, and good natured… unless you screw tes over. The Blossom (he/him): The Lambic House is just supposed to make beer, sell it around the world, and keep people happy. But with each keg delivered by the sect's Abbot of Provision, the Blossom also serves a short, populist whisper. Zo'la (zo/zo's, they/them): As a projection artists, Zo'la seeks to create a cinematic work that captures the dynamic spirit of this historical moment. Born to Columnar, then drawn to the Apostlosian ideology of Dynamism (which values speed, change, and violence above all else. A wildcard and a vanguard. Friends with Gucci Garantine, despite having spent time on opposite sides of the Kesh/Apostolos war. Agon Ortlights (she/her): Aided by her servicebot companions, Agon worked hard to attain the rank of lieutenant in the Company of the Spade, where she's become a veteren mercenary, a skilled miner, and a hell of a drinking buddy. A.O. Rooke (he/him): Former Stel Orion mercenary, now commander of the Rapid Evening's \"toughs\" squad. Eiden Teak (he/him) : Soldier and commander in the Sable Court. Wears the wounds of past fights on him with a distinct sort of pride, inherited from his time fighting as an Apostolosian soldier: He's missing right leg under the knee, and a number of his antlers have been snapped and broken. Wears loose olive drab fatigues, marked the occult insignia and wards of the Court. Mourningbride (she/her): An initiate in the Sable Court, and a former Elect. Alise Breka (she/her): Guest lecturer at Verglaz University and Author of popular Renegade Hearts pulp series, which tells stories of daring and romantic Hallow pilots. On Partizan to research her next book, partly by interviewing the imprisoned pirate Exeter Leap. //Places\\\\ The Prophet's Sea: A massive ocean that dominates the center of most maps of Partizan. It is said that the sea was made by the prophet Logos Kantel in their first miracle, after walking the length of its radius and climbing a set of hills that would soon become islands. Marengo: Oxbridge's biggest rival to the far west of Orion territory, Marengo borders the Prophet's Path and because of that has been favored by three groups: faithful hoping to draw on the strength of passing pilgrims; traders eager to take tourist coin; and criminals who like the proximity of uncontrolled territory. Auspice: A seaside city in the Prophet's Path north of Marengo (which it is smaller than) and south of Obelle (which it dwarfs). Auspice is the final destination of the land travel portion of the yearly pilgrimage led by the Church of the Resin Heart. Resting on a landmass that appears on a map to be a finger pointing eastward, it has become a coastal refuge for members of Millennium Break. //Divines\\\\ Present (it/its): On first blush, Present might be confused for a small, if luxurious frigate. And sometimes, it is just that: Its oval structure houses living quarters, a humble armory, enough cargo space to hold a single hollow, and even a fully stocked bar. But at a snap of its elect's fingers, it transforms into a humanoid war machine that serves its elect loyally, outclasses any single Hollow or Hallow in operation, and is capable of holding its own against many other Divines in combat. Neither of these facets are what really define Present, though. Instead, it is the divine's ability to blink from one location to another, traveling across huge distances in an instant. A journey which would take even the most well-appointed ship of the Principality's vast fleets a year takes Present only a second. In a world so fractured and large, where distance is felt materially, presence becomes a miracle. //Things\\\\ Icebreaker Prime: A massive arsenal, garrison, airfield, and a firebase all rolled into one. Icebreaker Prime is a rumbling carrier which prowls land and sea, armed with innumerable weapons and potentially housing over ten thousand soldiers. Currently, Icebreaker Prime is under the command of Clementine Kesh and the Rapid Evening, and is hidden in the most unperturbed waters of the Prophet's Sea. //Additional Notes\\\\ Crossroads Crossroad #1: Will The Kingdom allow civilian refugees to live on Icebreaker Prime?

      "description": "One might think that, with elections behind them, Millennium Break would turn its full attention outwards, towards the world it was trying to change. Instead, like an athlete determined to operate at peak performance, it turned further inward. Bringing democracy onboard Icebreaker was all well and good. A solid first step. But what was to be done about Clementine Kesh? What was to be done about those who would send fellow revolutionaries to die instead of stand with their comrades? What would be done about those who abetted the reactionaries? They set the world on fire in the name of justice only to ask: What might justice look like? This week on PARTIZAN: Millennium Break: The First and Second Arrests of Clementine Kesh ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of the prophet's religious mission. The \"resin heart\" in question is a 3-foot large object pulled from the sea 400+ years ago and displayed as a relic by the Church. It was originally part of the Exemplar. Millennium Break: Dissidents, idealogues, rebels, and mercenaries launch a revolution from a state-of-the-art mobile fortress. They agree on little, except this: It is time for a new Millennium. Strand Semaphore: Using ancient Hyphan technology, this messenger service is able to send text-based communications to anywhere on-moon, so long as they've built an outpost there. Lambic House: A group of beer-brewing monks who both operate a brewery and manage a sizable civilian settlement deep in the mountains of the Pique Ridge. Part of the Shepherd's Crook. HORIZON: In the popular consciousness, HORIZON is a radical, anti-Principality terrorist organization. In actuality, they are a radical-reformist group, which seeks to drive out what it perceives as corruption in an empire that ought be pursuing noble (instead of selfish) ends. Rumored to be funded by Stel Kesh's House Brightline. The Mysteries Metronomica/ \"Metronomica\"/\"The Cult of Perennial\" : Guided by the paradoxical belief in historical cycles and radical freedom, the Isles of Logos offers this faith of the Adversary, Perennial, perhaps the only safe ground in the entire galaxy. The Red Fennecs: Technically, the Red Fennecs are an Apostolosian logistics and transport squad. In actuality, they're utilized by their commanding officer, Tes'ili Serikos, as the backbone of a humble smuggling operation. The Sable Court: Some say that on dark nights, they have seen these Ashen witches on the eastern edge of Lake Timea, horns and antlers glittering in the light of Girandole. Some even say that a former elect walks among them. Heresy, all of it. Company of the Spade: A veteran mercenary unit founded by space miners who learned how to pilot Hollows in the most dangerous of settings. They've been brought to Partizan to combine both types of expertise. The Oxblood Clan : What started as a group of orphans turned into a labor guild and criminal enterprise with connections across Partizan. Occasionally run rough-and-tumble military ops for extra cash. Allies with SBBR. //People\\\\ Sloe Uplight (he/him): His business card says \"Private Historian,\" his parlor rooms' security system says \"information broker,\" and his grinning mouth says \"no difference.\" A Kesh academic turned freelance fixer. Now, his attention has turned to Millennium Break. Quintessence \"Tessence\" Rey (he/him): A young member of the secret Equiaxed commune in Vigil City, Tessence is the community's only remaining military defender. In his custom Kosmos unit, he has helped defend his family and friends from Columnar aggression numerous times. He did, however, have a card up his sleeve. Jesset City (he/him) : Previously worked for Adamant Arms and Manufacturing, Jesset became full time Oxblood Clan lieutenant (and rising star) after his participation in the fateful mission in Obelle, and solidified his status as a leader after the assault on Orzen. Expert technician, rapidly developing hollow pilot, and Cipher Certified by Stel Nideo. Utilizes prostheses on his right arm, switching between an affordable myoelectric model with grip hooks and a custom model specifically designed for interfacing with a hollow cockpit. Apparatus Aperitif (they/them): Logos City, the largest independent city on Partizan, is known as a religious center, but its robotic night mayor ensures that everyone has a good time at the end of their time traveling the Prophet's Path.

      "description": "Word traveled fast: The Oxblood Clan had demanded elections, and whether they'd get them had become the talk of all Icebreaker. For the hundreds on board familiar with the guild's practices, Oxblood's insistence was no surprise. The group was famous for deciding on things \"as a family,\" which meant a mix of extempore votes on the shop floor and regular elections for key decision-making roles throughout the organization. But the degree to which the entire fortress had been consumed with the question? That was a surprise. The scale of Oxblood's representation on board was part of that. In a crew of over a thousand, they made up a solid block of a few hundred, and that meant that a whisper was heard as a galewind. Within a day, a game of telephone (and the Oxblood reputation for drama) had transformed the election fliers into \"fires,\" demands written in burning oil across the topdeck. But it was also due to the novelty. While many had brushed against lowercase D democracy in their daily lives--whether that was reading about the (mostly appointed) Kesh legislature's referendum votes or deciding which Zenith Fund research project to donate auxiliary processing hours to--many of those onboard had never even considered the possibility that their opinion should matter as much as anyone else's. But that novelty was a double edged sword. Stark and stolid hierarchies had extended the Principality for over 5,000 years. What if this voting thing was a little more than a fad? A small worm chewing away in the brain of the newly free. \"You are not worth it,\" it says. \"Return to the dirt.\" This week on PARTIZAN: Who Will Lead Millennium Break? ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of the prophet's religious mission.

Though colloquially referred to as \"the cult of Perennial,\" a title that many group members accept with a sort of sardonic pride, the full name of the group is the Mysteries Metronomica, or simply Metronomica. Both Metronomica's theology and praxis center on the ideas of eternal recurrence, historical cycles (large and small), and the impossibility of stability. History will turn, and they will help it on its way. Their relationship with Perennial gives them a unique relationship to the Perennial Wave.

      "description": "First off, a quick note of thanks to everyone who has already contributed to our fundraising efforts for Reclaim the Block, The Bail Project, BYP100, and The Marshall Project, which we announced last week. Thanks to your donations we've raised over $70,000 for these causes, which is INCREDIBLE. But the sale continues. You can go to friendsatthetable.itch.io to contribute. Let's push for $100k! At peak operating efficiency, Icebreaker Prime can comfortably house almost 10,000 soldiers, sailors, and service members, with plenty of room to train, work, and even relax. But here, in the middle of the Prophet's Sea, far from the Apostolosian supply lines for which it was built, and still badly damaged from Kesh's dramatic assault months prior, Icebreaker Prime is anything but operating at peak efficiency. From rations to rifles, the storehouses grow emptier by the day. Entire decks are off limits, flooded or worse. The technicians are still figuring out how the engine actually works--which means they're far from understanding how to totally fix it. The fortress is mighty, yet thin: a single attack could mean its end. And so, the revolutionaries of Millennium Break need to make a choice. Do they aim their weapons on the un- and underprotected vessels of the planet's richest Stels? Do they dare let loose the notorious pirate, Exeter Leap? Or do they scrimp and save, maintaining on what little they have, turning to violence only when absolutely necessary, or when safety is guaranteed.. This week on PARTIZAN: Forward, to Piracy (Sharp Tensions Across Tremulous Seas) ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ Stel Kesh: The oldest established power in the galaxy, built around a stuffy (and secretive) aristocracy. They are tied to the Past. History, knowledge, stubbornness. Stel Nideo: Created the largest faith in the empire, and used that influence to shape (and surveil) mass culture. They are tied to the Present. Faith, coercion, stability. Stel Orion: An industrial giant that controls more literal space than any other Stel, yet is also the most fragmented and unstable. They are tied to Space . Wealth, labor, expansion. Stel Columnar: A fence-sitting democracy, made up largely of synthetics on the cutting edge of technology, art, politics, and war. They are tied to the Future. Innovation, style, cowardice. Stel Apostolos: A dynamic and diverse military powerhouse, guided by an iconic, but controversial leader. They are tied to Motion . Speed, change, violence. Scrivener's Guild: An organization of (armed) clerks who mediate negotiations, draft contracts, and keep records of all industrial, commercial, and private business operations with Orion-aligned organizations. Unhappy with SBBR's performance. The Church of Received Asterism: The most widely practiced faith in the galaxy, and one of the earliest major organizations in the Divine Principality, created at the beginning of the Miraculous Millenium, over 3000 years ago. Teaches that Divines, the immortal machines and mechs that helped establish the Principality's hold on the galaxy, reflect the best aspects of the state itself. The divine Strength, in other words, is like a living flag of the Principality's own strength. Organized as a central church, led by a religious leader named a \"Cycle,\" whose will is enacted across the Principality by their many \"Songs,\" who rule worlds, star systems, or sometimes entire constellations. The Church of Progressive Asterism: Created as the teachings of the prophet Logos Kantel grew in popularity 1000 years ago, and made a secondary state religion in order to prevent a large schism. Teaches that Divines are true embodiments of their names, and that the citizens and states of the Principality should look to them as guiding stars. The Divine Strength, in other words, is a reflection of strength itself, or maybe \"god's strength,\" and we should aspire to make our strength look like the divine's. Unlike Received Asterism, there is no single central church, but hundreds of smaller sects, schools, and cults, each devoted to individual Divines, grouped sub-pantheons, or otherwise adjusted beliefs. The Disciples of Logos: A small sect, technically of Progressive Asterists, who believe that Progressive Asterism itself operates under a misunderstanding of the prophet Logos Kantel's words. Membership spans Divinity, but remains miniscule in size compared to even other Progressive Asterist sects. The core tenets and practices of the Disciples of Logos are built around aspiration, actualization, and \"progression\" from one's current self (or from society's current state) to a future one. To encourage that process of change, the Disciples of Logos offer services like tutoring, transport, medical aid, shelter, and counseling to those on their journeys. The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of the prophet's religious mission. The \"resin heart\" in question is a 3-foot large object pulled from the sea 400+ years ago and displayed as a relic by the Church. It was originally part of the Exemplar. The Friends of Gur Sevraq: The name given to the current membership of the Church of the Resin heart, who follow the teachings of a new prophet, Gur Sevraq, who has reportedly performed a number of miracles. They teach the value of and need for open communication between regular members of the principality, and dream of a galactic-communications network which would allow people to send messages between worlds in a matter of seconds or minutes instead of days, weeks, or months. With that established, the Friends believe, change and \"progression\" would sweep through the Principality. Millennium Break: Dissidents, idealogues, rebels, and mercenaries launch a revolution from a state-of-the-art mobile fortress. They agree on little, except this: It is time for a new Millennium. Strand Semaphore: Using ancient Hyphan technology, this messenger service is able to send text-based communications to anywhere on-moon, so long as they've built an outpost there. Lambic House: A group of beer-brewing monks who both operate a brewery and manage a sizable civilian settlement deep in the mountains of the Pique Ridge. Part of the Shepherd's Crook. The Shepherd's Crook: A sect inside of Received Asterism which began soon after the founding of the church as a collection of monks who provided safety and service to then-new colonies… in exchange for wealth and power. Though their extortionist tendencies (and military might) was reined in by the central church, they remain a group focused on local communities rather than central bureaucracy or dogma. They've also become the home of the Sovereign Immunities, an elite rank of political advisor which carries the freedom to speak directly when others would be censored and which is offered a high degree of diplomatic immunity. HORIZON: In the popular consciousness, HORIZON is a radical, anti-Principality terrorist organization. In actuality, they are a radical-reformist group, which seeks to drive out what it perceives as corruption in an empire that ought be pursuing noble (instead of selfish) ends. Rumored to be funded by Stel Kesh's House Brightline. The Mysteries Metronomica/ \"Metronomica\"/\"The Cult of Perennial\" : Guided by the paradoxical belief in historical cycles and radical freedom, the Isles of Logos offers this faith of the Adversary, Perennial, perhaps the only safe ground in the entire galaxy. Though colloquially referred to as \"the cult of Perennial,\" a title that many group members accept with a sort of sardonic pride, the full name of the group is the Mysteries Metronomica, or simply Metronomica. Both Metronomica's theology and praxis center on the ideas of eternal recurrence, historical cycles (large and small), and the impossibility of stability. History will turn, and they will help it on its way. Their relationship with Perennial gives them a unique relationship to the Perennial Wave. The Red Fennecs: Technically, the Red Fennecs are an Apostolosian logistics and transport squad. In actuality, they're utilized by their commanding officer, Tes'ili Serikos, as the backbone of a humble smuggling operation. The Sable Court: Some say that on dark nights, they have seen these Ashen witches on the eastern edge of Lake Timea, horns and antlers glittering in the light of Girandole. Some even say that a former elect walks among them. Heresy, all of it. Company of the Spade: A veteran mercenary unit founded by space miners who learned how to pilot Hollows in the most dangerous of settings. They've been brought to Partizan to combine both types of expertise. The Oxblood Clan : What started as a group of orphans turned into a labor guild and criminal enterprise with connections across Partizan. Occasionally run rough-and-tumble military ops for extra cash. Allies with SBBR. //People\\\\ Apparatus Aperitif (they/them): Logos City, the largest independent city on Partizan, is known as a religious center, but its robotic night mayor ensures that everyone has a good time at the end of their time traveling the Prophet's Path. Representative of the Mysteries Metronomica onboard Icebreaker Prime. Gur Sevraq (he/them): Leader of the Church of the Resin Heart. Miracle worker. Currently on board Icebreaker Prime. Has possession of the Divine Future, which gives them startling prescience and the ability to imagine futures outside of the confines of the hegemonic and imperialist world around him. Si'dra Balos (Si/Si's, they/them): During their time in a communications division of the Apostolosian Navy, Si'dra saw the cost of war first hand. Now they dream of a world where people can connect instead of fight. Tes'ili Serikos (they/them, tes/tes') : This Apostolosian transport specialist, black marketeer, and Tes'ili Serikos can get just about anything just about anywhere, for a price. Short, round, fuzzy, and good natured… unless you screw tes over. The Blossom (he/him): The Lambic House is just supposed to make beer, sell it around the world, and keep people happy. But with each keg delivered by the sect's Abbot of Provision, the Blossom also serves a short, populist whisper. Zo'la (zo/zo's, they/them): As a projection artists, Zo'la seeks to create a cinematic work that captures the dynamic spirit of this historical moment. Born to Columnar, then drawn to the Apostlosian ideology of Dynamism (which values speed, change, and violence above all else. A wildcard and a vanguard. Friends with Gucci Garantine, despite having spent time on opposite sides of the Kesh/Apostolos war. Thetonious aka \"Tone\" (they/them) - Gucci's primary bodyguard, originally served in a Kesh military commando squad. Elite-class expertise in urban combat, infiltration, and rapid escalation tactics. Zosimel (they/them): Legendary Apostolosian military tactician famous for troop maneuvers that overawed the enemy, producing a sensation of being overwhelmed even when the numbers didn't reflect that. Zosimel eventually outlined this strategy as a sort of broader philosophy called Dynamism. Agon Ortlights (she/her): Aided by her servicebot companions, Agon worked hard to attain the rank of lieutenant in the Company of the Spade, where she's become a veteren mercenary, a skilled miner, and a hell of a drinking buddy. A.O. Rooke (he/him): Former Stel Orion mercenary, now commander of the Rapid Evening's \"toughs\" squad. Eiden Teak (he/him) : Soldier and commander in the Sable Court. Wears the wounds of past fights on him with a distinct sort of pride, inherited from his time fighting as an Apostolosian soldier: He's missing right leg under the knee, and a number of his antlers have been snapped and broken. Wears loose olive drab fatigues, marked the occult insignia and wards of the Court. Mourningbride (she/her): An initiate in the Sable Court, and a former Elect. Alise Breka (she/her): Guest lecturer at Verglaz University and Author of popular Renegade Hearts pulp series, which tells stories of daring and romantic Hallow pilots. On Partizan to research her next book, partly by interviewing the imprisoned pirate Exeter Leap. //Places\\\\ The Prophet's Sea: A massive ocean that dominates the center of most maps of Partizan. It is said that the sea was made by the prophet Logos Kantel in their first miracle, after walking the length of its radius and climbing a set of hills that would soon become islands. //Things\\\\ Icebreaker Prime: A massive arsenal, garrison, airfield, and a firebase all rolled into one. Icebreaker Prime is a rumbling carrier which prowls land and sea, armed with innumerable weapons and potentially housing over ten thousand soldiers. Currently, Icebreaker Prime is under the command of Clementine Kesh and the Rapid Evening, and is hidden in the most unperturbed waters of the Prophet's Sea. //Additional Notes\\\\ Crossroads Crossroad #1: Will The Kingdom allow civilian refugees to live on Icebreaker Prime? Crossroad #2: Will the Kingdom rob the surreptitious Columnar and Orion arms shipments in order to address our resource problem? The Millenium Break Manifesto We will help those displaced by the war on Partizan. Character Bonds Valence : I feel the uncomfortable draw of the unknown from Apparatus, but must keep focus on the revolution and the way of God. An overindulgence of curiosity would sidetrack me. Apparatus : Gur Sevraq has always been a bit of a Day Mayor. I hope he has not gotten too used to the light. Gur Sevraq : Milli is right to distrust all who seek to direct her power, but she ought fight for those who share her dreams yet lack her strength. Milli : Sovereign Immunity's connections could get us out of prison. I need to make sure this summit doesn't make him forget that. SI : This is the moment Clementine must show her mettle as a leader. If she is truly a frivolous child I will find someone better. Clem : United, Gucci and I could be a powerful force for Kesh, with me at its head. Her misplaced egalitarianism, however, is a problem. Gucci : Broun knows how to get things done and I know what they want in return. But there's a difference between service and loyalty, and I don't know when or where they'll draw that line. Broun : I need Valence to keep their promise to me but I don't believe they can.

      "description": "Hey everyone, Austin here. Today's episode kicks off an eight episode run tracing the revolutionary movement on Partizan that formed at the end of the previous episode.We'll be playing (butchering?) the Kingdom 2nd Edition playtest by Ben Robbins. Below, you can find all the standard info that is in an episode dossier, but in lieu of a traditional description, I wanted to use this space to let you know about an initiative that we're kicking off today. As the themes of our show have probably illustrated, all of us on this show are deeply invested in issues of justice and equality. We all stand behind the protests that have emerged across the country and world demanding justice for the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Tayler, Tony McDade, Ahmaud Arbery, and the countless others who have been taken from us. It has given us a great deal of hope to see so many rally against a culture of white supremacy and cruel, violent, and negligent policing. To that end, we're donating $5,000 to a few groups, listed below, to help them in their fight against injustice. We'd love it if you could help us raise even more. To help encourage that, we've worked with the artists and organizers of all four of the previous Friends at the Table fan zines to get permission to offer digital copies of those zines to help raise money. It's an INCREDIBLE collection of work from over 100 artists, and you can get them all right here. We're also offering the three completed Friends at the Table Patreon postcard sets digitally for the first time ever, at a greatly reduced price from their original month-to-month cost. To check all of this out, just go to friendsatthetable.itch.io . You can pick up any of the zines for $10, each of the postcard sets for $50, or the entire bundle for a flat $150. Finally, if you're reading this today (June 5th, 2020), then that means that Bandcamp is waiving their fees on all purchases. And because of that, Jack will be donating any money from purchases of Friends at the Table soundtracks or anything else on their Bandcamp ( notquitereal.bandcamp.com ) today. So that's another way you can support this drive. About the Groups We're Supporting Reclaim the Block began in 2018 and organizes Minneapolis community and city council members to move money from the police department into other areas of the city's budget that truly promote community health and safety. They believe health, safety and resiliency exist without police of any kind. They organize around policies that strengthen community-led safety initiatives and reduce reliance on police departments. They do not believe that increased regulation of or public engagement with the police will lead to safer communities, as community testimony and documented police conduct suggest otherwise. Black Youth Project 100 is a national, member-based organization of Black 18-35 year old activists and organizers, dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all Black people. They do this through building a network focused on transformative leadership development, direct action organizing, advocacy, and political education using a Black queer feminist lens. BYP100 has chapters in Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Washington D.C., and Wisconsin. The Bail Project is a national nonprofit organization that provides free bail assistance and pre-trial support to thousands of low-income people every year while advocating for dramatic transformation of the current criminal justice system. The Marshall Project is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news organization that seeks to create and sustain a sense of national urgency about the U.S. criminal justice system. Again, you can support this initiative by going to friendsatthetable.itch.io . Thanks, and I hope you enjoy this week's episode. ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ Stel Kesh: The oldest established power in the galaxy, built around a stuffy (and secretive) aristocracy.

Currently, Icebreaker Prime is under the command of Clementine Kesh and the Rapid Evening, and is hidden in the most unperturbed waters of the Prophet's Sea. \"Autonomy Itself\"/\"The True Divine\"/The God of the Nobel/The God of Logos Kantel (they/them): Granted the power to transform Partizan into a living world to Logos Kantel 1000 years ago. Guided the Nobel and other cultures in the Scutum-Centaurus arm through the course of their history. A God of becoming, not being, process, not finality. Their origin is unknown, sometimes debated, but rarely considered important to their devotees, who care more about Their current divinity rather than the circumstances by which it was arrived at. The phrases \"the True Divine\" and \"Autonomy Itself\" are found in some Progressive Asterists texts and doctrine, but also across heterodox and heretical religious creeds and in the teachings of gnostic and esoteric secret societies. The Exemplar : \"God's Divine.\" Originally built 1000 years ago, now spread in \"parts\" across the moon. Its beating heart was left in the sea. It's countless eyes buried under the Memoria Teardrop. Its blood runs through the springs of the Pique Ridge. Its powerful voice echoes through the windswept canyons of the Barranca. And, perhaps, something else trapped below the ice in the northern reaches of Kesh territory in the Verglaz Taiga. //Additional Notes\\\\ Crossroad #1: Will The Kingdom allow civilian refugees to live on Icebreaker Prime? Character Bonds Valence : I feel the uncomfortable draw of the unknown from Apparatus, but must keep focus on the revolution and the way of God. An overindulgence of curiosity would sidetrack me. Apparatus : Gur Sevraq has always been a bit of a Day Mayor. I hope he has not gotten too used to the light. Gur Sevraq : Milli is right to distrust all who seek to direct her power, but she ought fight for those who share her dreams yet lack her strength. Milli : Sovereign Immunity's connections could get us out of prison. I need to make sure this summit doesn't make him forget that. SI : This is the moment Clementine must show her mettle as a leader. If she is truly a frivolous child I will find someone better. Clem : United, Gucci and I could be a powerful force for Kesh, with me at its head. Her misplaced egalitarianism, however, is a problem. Gucci : Broun knows how to get things done and I know what they want in return. But there's a difference between service and loyalty, and I don't know when or where they'll draw that line. Broun : I need Valence to keep their promise to me but I don't believe they can.

      "description": "The town of Rezevi is quiet, most days. Five years ago, when the war with Kesh first kicked off, the sleepy fishing town's residents wondered if their lives would be shaken by the conflict. But as an Apostolosian town, the demands of war--mandatory service, expectation of quarter, junior and senior reserve duty--were already stitched into daily life. In reality, it simply meant that their assigned fishing quotas raised a bit. But over the last week, a shocking number of strangers have passed through Rezevi, offering high-tech military scrap in exchange for necessities like bedding, fuel, and chowder. What the citizens of Rezevi do not know, of course, is that the now-invisible Icebreaker Prime sits in the sea a few hours away, where the Rapid Evening licks its wounds and prepares to play host to rebels, revolutionaries, and radicals the likes of which Clementine Kesh could hardly imagine. This week on PARTIZAN: On the Eve of Revolution ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ Strand Semaphore: Using ancient Hyphan technology, this messenger service is able to send text-based communications to anywhere on-moon, so long as they've built an outpost there. Lambic House: A group of beer-brewing monks who both operate a brewery and manage a sizable civilian settlement deep in the mountains of the Pique Ridge. Part of the Shepherd's Crook. The Shepherd's Crook: A sect inside of Received Asterism which began soon after the founding of the church as a collection of monks who provided safety and service to then-new colonies… in exchange for wealth and power. Though their extortionist tendencies (and military might) was reined in by the central church, they remain a group focused on local communities rather than central bureaucracy or dogma. They've also become the home of the Sovereign Immunities, an elite rank of political advisor which carries the freedom to speak directly when others would be censored and which is offered a high degree of diplomatic immunity. The Pact of Necessary Venture : Though they trace their lineage back to an exploratory committee founded in the late 14th century of the Perfect Millenium, the Pact was not made in earnest until five years ago in 1418 PM, soon after hostilities began between Kesh and Apostolos. It's original leadership committee, Plumeria, Gallica, Myosotis, Rye, and Hyacinth determined that to ensure the future stability of the Principality, the Pact would establish a power base in the Scutum–Centaurus arm, amass a vast fleet using the unexploited resources there, and sweep both princepts out of power, replacing the role with a five-part council representing each Stel equally. The Curtain of Divinity: Though Kesh is technically governed through an elaborate parliamentary democracy, the truth is that The Curtain of Divinity, a secretive organization inside of the Stel (and with agents across all of the Principality), serves as the actual power behind the throne. Knowledge of the Curtain is carefully guarded, and its membership is even further protected. Was originally established to rein in the Principality's most tyrannical institutions and encourage growth and equity over generations, while hiding the truth of what lied beyond the Scutum-Centaurus Portcullis. Over time, their more noble aims were eroded, and only this final goal remained, along with a much more selfish goal of controlling the state. Is currently in a silent war against the Pact of Necessary Venture. The Mysteries Metronomica/ \"Metronomica\"/\"The Cult of Perennial\" : Guided by the paradoxical belief in historical cycles and radical freedom, the Isles of Logos offers this faith of the Adversary, Perennial, perhaps the only safe ground in the entire galaxy. Though colloquially referred to as \"the cult of Perennial,\" a title that many group members accept with a sort of sardonic pride, the full name of the group is the Mysteries Metronomica, or simply Metronomica. Both Metronomica's theology and praxis center on the ideas of eternal recurrence, historical cycles (large and small), and the impossibility of stability. History will turn, and they will help it on its way. Their relationship with Perennial gives them a unique relationship to the Perennial Wave. The Red Fennecs: Technically, the Red Fennecs are an Apostolosian logistics and transport squad. In actuality, they're utilized by their commanding officer, Tes'ili Serikos, as the backbone of a humble smuggling operation. The Sable Court: Some say that on dark nights, they have seen these Ashen witches on the eastern edge of Lake Timea, horns and antlers glittering in the light of Girandole. Some even say that a former elect walks among them. Heresy, all of it. Company of the Spade: A veteran mercenary unit founded by space miners who learned how to pilot Hollows in the most dangerous of settings. They've been brought to Partizan to combine both types of expertise. The Oxblood Clan : What started as a group of orphans turned into a labor guild and criminal enterprise with connections across Partizan. Occasionally run rough-and-tumble military ops for extra cash. Allies with SBBR. The Swordbreakers : An Apostolosian squad blessed by the Divine Commitment and led by Cas'alear Rizah, the adopted sibling of the Apokine and Princept Dahlia. They're known across the war as legend killers who punch above their weight. //People\\\\ Si'dra Balos (Si/Si's, they/them): During their time in a communications division of the Apostolosian Navy, Si'dra saw the cost of war first hand. Now they dream of a world where people can connect instead of fight. Tes'ili Serikos (they/them, tes/tes') : This Apostolosian transport specialist, black marketeer, and Tes'ili Serikos can get just about anything just about anywhere, for a price. Short, round, fuzzy, and good natured… unless you screw tes over. The Blossom (he/him): The Lambic House is just supposed to make beer, sell it around the world, and keep people happy. But with each keg delivered by the sect's Abbot of Provision, the Blossom also serves a short, populist whisper. Cas'alear Rizah (cas/cas', they/them) : Leader of the Swordbreakers. Cas has brown skin with dark green hair up in a bun, with a few strands hanging down in front of their face (which is framed with similarly colored scales covering cas' jawline and neck. Broken sword tattoos under their eyes. Reputation as being beautiful and brave by allies, unflinching and unpredictable by foes. Pilots the notorious Ataraxia. Plumeria (she/her): Former elect of the Divine Past, High Designate of Stel Kesh, signatory of the Pact of Necessary Venture, and Bibliognost of all Divinity. Killed during the theft of the divine Future. Gallica (she/her): Elect of the Divine Present, Chief Emissary of Stel Nideo, Verse (missionary) in the Holy Church of Received Asterism, signatory of the Pact of Necessary Venture, and Anodyne of all Divinity. Myosotis (he/him): Former elect of Future, Chair of the Zenith Fund, signatory of the Pact of Necessary Venture and Wright of all Divinity. Future was stolen from him. Rye (he/him): Elect of the Space, Second of the Nine Coronet of Stel Orion, Chief Signatory of the Pact of Necessary Venture, and Provedore of all Divinity Hyacinth (they/them): Former Elect of Motion, Grand Marshal of the Interior, and signatory of the Pact of Necessary Venture, and Prōtostratōr of all Divinity. Served for 99 years as commander of the Black Century. Zo'la (zo/zo's, they/them): As a projection artists, Zo'la seeks to create a cinematic work that captures the dynamic spirit of this historical moment. Born to Columnar, then drawn to the Apostlosian ideology of Dynamism (which values speed, change, and violence above all else. A wildcard and a vanguard. Friends with Gucci Garantine, despite having spent time on opposite sides of the Kesh/Apostolos war. Agon Ortlights (she/her): Aided by her servicebot companions, Agon worked hard to attain the rank of lieutenant in the Company of the Spade, where she's become a veteren mercenary, a skilled miner, and a hell of a drinking buddy. Figure A (they/them): A synthetic being that once worked inside of the Divine Past, working to make the data the Divine had available to it more understandable by other people. Crysanth Kesh (she/her) : Clementine Kesh's mother. Third in line to the throne of Kesh. As Gabardine of the Curtain of Divinity High ranking member of The Curtain, the highest such on Partizan itself. Cymbidium (he/him): The deceased Elect of the Divine Past. Gave Thisbe a message to deliver to Mourningbride. //Places\\\\ Rezevi: A small fishing village on the island-dotted northwestern coast of the Apostolosian Barranca. The nearest town to the current location of the still-cloaked Fort Icebreaker. The Prophet's Sea: A massive ocean that dominates the center of most maps of Partizan. It is said that the sea was made by the prophet Logos Kantel in their first miracle, after walking the length of its radius and climbing a set of hills that would soon become islands. Icebreaker Prime: A massive arsenal, garrison, airfield, and a firebase all rolled into one. Icebreaker Prime is a rumbling carrier which prowls land and sea, armed with innumerable weapons and potentially housing over ten thousand soldiers. Currently, Icebreaker Prime is under the command of Clementine Kesh and the Rapid Evening, and is hidden in the most unperturbed waters of the Prophet's Sea. The Isles of Logos: An independent nation built by the followers of the prophet Logos Kantel's around their very first church. Though only a small handful of islands in the Prophet's Sea, the Isles keep a standing defense force that rivals any individual unit of the Major Stels. //Divines\\\\ The Divine Past: Part floating city, part living library. The Divine Past was built tens of thousands of years before the Divine Principality was created. It stores an untold amount of information about the cultures it has observed, including the Divine Principality itself. The only person who can access this information is its Elect, who wanders its endless halls and travels across Divinity as equal parts librarian, priest, ship captain, and diplomat. Was destroyed when it crashed into the sand west of Obelle. Is currently being rebuilt.

      "description": "After a stunning victory in Orzen, the Society of Banners and Bright Returns must now face the cold light of day. Bodies wounded, hollows damaged, and reputations scarred, Broun, Thisbe, and Valence recuperate as best they can. But as the war becomes ever more complicated, and as new expectations are placed on them, tensions raise from a simmer to a boil. This week on PARTIZAN: On the Edge of Fracture ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ Stel Kesh: The oldest established power in the galaxy, built around a stuffy (and secretive) aristocracy. They are tied to the Past. History, knowledge, stubbornness. Stel Nideo: Created the largest faith in the empire, and used that influence to shape (and surveil) mass culture. They are tied to the Present. Faith, coercion, stability. Stel Orion: An industrial giant that controls more literal space than any other Stel, yet is also the most fragmented and unstable. They are tied to Space . Wealth, labor, expansion. Stel Columnar: A fence-sitting democracy, made up largely of synthetics on the cutting edge of technology, art, politics, and war. They are tied to the Future. Innovation, style, cowardice. Stel Apostolos: A dynamic and diverse military powerhouse, guided by an iconic, but controversial leader. They are tied to Motion . Speed, change, violence. Scrivener's Guild: An organization of (armed) clerks who mediate negotiations, draft contracts, and keep records of all industrial, commercial, and private business operations with Orion-aligned organizations. Unhappy with SBBR's performance. The Oxblood Clan: What started as a group of orphans turned into a labor guild and criminal enterprise with connections across Partizan. Occasionally run rough-and-tumble military ops for extra cash. Allies with SBBR. The Curtain of Divinity: Though Kesh is technically governed through an elaborate parliamentary democracy, the truth is that The Curtain of Divinity, a secretive organization inside of the Stel (and with agents across all of the Principality), serves as the actual power behind the throne. Knowledge of the Curtain is carefully guarded, and its membership is even further protected. Was originally established to rein in the Principality's most tyrannical institutions and encourage growth and equity over generations, while hiding the truth of what lied beyond the Scutum-Centaurus Portcullis. Over time, their more noble aims were eroded, and only this final goal remained, along with a much more selfish goal of controlling the state. The Pact of Necessary Venture : Though they trace their lineage back to an exploratory committee founded in the late 14th century of the Perfect Millenium, the Pact was not made in earnest until five years ago in 1418 PM, soon after hostilities began between Kesh and Apostolos. It's original leadership committee, ████████, ███████, ████████, ███, and ████████ determined that to ensure the future stability of the Principality,the Pact would establish a power base in the Scutum–Centaurus arm, amass a vast fleet using the unexploited resources there, and sweep both princepts out of power, █████████ ███ ████ ████ █ █████████ ███████ ████████████ ████ ████ ███████. The Nobel: The people and culture from which Valence originates. They live beyond Partizan, in the Scutum-Centaurus arm of the Milky Way, which a past Princept declared was not to be colonized or even explored. But years ago they suffered an attack by the Pact of Necessary Venture, though who specifically ordered the attack is still unknown. The majority of Nobel worship the same God as the Disciples of Logos, though the specifics of each faith remain unique. They are gaseous, telepathic beings who often use mechanical bodies in order to interact with other sorts of people. The Church of Received Asterism: The most widely practiced faith in the galaxy, and one of the earliest major organizations in the Divine Principality, created at the beginning of the Miraculous Millenium, over 3000 years ago. Teaches that Divines, the immortal machines and mechs that helped establish the Principality's hold on the galaxy, reflect the best aspects of the state itself. The divine Strength, in other words, is like a living flag of the Principality's own strength. Organized as a central church, led by a religious leader named a \"Cycle,\" whose will is enacted across the Principality by their many \"Songs,\" who rule worlds, star systems, or sometimes entire constellations. The Church of Progressive Asterism: Created as the teachings of the prophet Logos Kantel grew in popularity 1000 years ago, and made a secondary state religion in order to prevent a large schism. Teaches that Divines are true embodiments of their names, and that the citizens and states of the Principality should look to them as guiding stars. The Divine Strength, in other words, is a reflection of strength itself, or maybe \"god's strength,\" and we should aspire to make our strength look like the divine's. Unlike Received Asterism, there is no single central church, but hundreds of smaller sects, schools, and cults, each devoted to individual Divines, grouped sub-pantheons, or otherwise adjusted beliefs. The Disciples of Logos: A small sect, technically of Progressive Asterists, who believe that Progressive Asterism itself operates under a misunderstanding of the prophet Logos Kantel's words. Membership spans Divinity, but remains miniscule in size compared to even other Progressive Asterist sects. The core tenets and practices of the Disciples of Logos are built around aspiration, actualization, and \"progression\" from one's current self (or from society's current state) to a future one. To encourage that process of change, the Disciples of Logos offer services like tutoring, transport, medical aid, shelter, and counseling to those on their journeys. The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of the prophet's religious mission. The \"resin heart\" in question is a 3-foot large object pulled from the sea 400+ years ago and displayed as a relic by the Church. It was originally part of the Exemplar. The Friends of Gur Sevraq: The name given to the current membership of the Church of the Resin heart, who follow the teachings of a new prophet, Gur Sevraq, who has reportedly performed a number of miracles. They teach the value of and need for open communication between regular members of the principality, and dream of a galactic-communications network which would allow people to send messages between worlds in a matter of seconds or minutes instead of days, weeks, or months. With that established, the Friends believe, change and \"progression\" would sweep through the Principality. The Sable Court: Some say that on dark nights, they have seen these Ashen witches on the eastern edge of Lake Timea, horns and antlers glittering in the light of Girandole. Some even say that a former elect walks among them. Heresy, all of it. //People\\\\ Kueen Overture Rooke (she/her): SBBR's contact at the Scrivener's Guild. A former ace pilot, lead mechanic, and battlefield commander, KO now uses her expertise to dispatch and guide mercenary units across Partizan as a broker in the Scrivener's Guild. Booker Treequote (he/him) : Senior Broker for the Scrivener's Guild. Called in to audit SBBR's recent activities. Gur Sevraq (he/them): Leader of the Church of the Resin Heart. Miracle worker. Currently on board Icebreaker Prime. Has possession of the Divine Future, which gives them startling prescience and the ability to imagine futures outside of the confines of the hegemonic and imperialist world around him. The Tranquil Princept: Made an oath with the God of the Nobel 1000 years ago, promising that the Principality would not go beyond Partizan into the Scutum-Centaurus arm until they had dissolved their empire and become an equitable society. Created the Curtain of Divinity to achieve that goal. Gucci Garantine (she/her) : Leader of HORIZON's efforts on Partizan.. Jesset City (he/him) : Oxblood Clan lieutenant, engineer, and pilot. Mourningbride (she/her): An initiate in the Sable Court, and a former Elect. //Places\\\\ Oxbridge: Most bridges connect land to land, but the enormous Bridge of the Ox connects ocean ports to the docks of largest freshwater lake on the moon. Under the bridge rests Oxbridge, a dense city of canals and crimson light, and the first large scale Principality settlement to come to the moon, nearly 1000 years ago. Oxbridge is split into three regions: Brightsky West, Underbridge, and Brightsky East. To the East and West, merchants, nobles, and the ever-upwardly mobile live, work, shop and play. But below the bridge's shadow is an undercity of laborers both local and transient, eking by from job to job, day to day, by the fuel of their effort and the light of the red, phosphorescent \"lamps\" that give Underbridge its distinct glow, even in daytime. Connecting it all together are a network of waterways, roads, and secret tunnels. And above it all is the Bridge of the Ox, the symbol of Orion's commitment to (and mastery of) brute-force ideology. Orzen: A city in the Pique Ridge. SBBR, HORIZON, and the Oxblood Clan attacked the city in an effort to recover information about Past's destruction and the Rapid Evening from a Palace archive there. Deep Dish Steak House: A loyal bar. The Prophet's Sea: A massive ocean that dominates the center of most maps of Partizan. It is said that the sea was made by the prophet Logos Kantel in their first miracle, after walking the length of its radius and climbing a set of hills that would soon become islands. The Prophet's Path: An autonomous region to the west of the Prophet's Sea, south of Apostolosian territory and north of Orion. These dusty badlands are dotted with small villages, farms, and other settlements. Its furthest, most western reaches are untouched by Kantel's miracle. In order to celebrate the millennial anniversary of Logos Kantel's arrival, the Church of the Resin Heart is traveling a pilgrimage on the route the prophet once took. The Isles of Logos: An independent nation built by the followers of the prophet Logos Kantel's around their very first church. Though only a small handful of islands in the Prophet's Sea, the Isles keep a standing defense force that rivals any individual unit of the Major Stels. //Divines\\\\ The Divine, Arbitrage (It/Its) : It is said that divinity was too long delayed this anteperennial machine, a god of trade. But the truth is, if it wanted to be divine in the twilight era, it simply would've negotiated that deal. //Things\\\\ \"Autonomy Itself\"/\"The True Divine\"/The God of the Nobel/The God of Logos Kantel (they/them): Granted the power to transform Partizan into a living world to Logos Kantel 1000 years ago. Guided the Nobel and other cultures in the Scutum-Centaurus arm through the course of their history. A God of becoming, not being, process, not finality. Their origin is unknown, sometimes debated, but rarely considered important to their devotees, who care more about Their current divinity rather than the circumstances by which it was arrived at. The phrases \"the True Divine\" and \"Autonomy Itself\" are found in some Progressive Asterists texts and doctrine, but also across heterodox and heretical religious creeds and in the teachings of gnostic and esoteric secret societies. The Exemplar : \"God's Divine.\" Originally built 1000 years ago, now spread in \"parts\" across the moon. Its beating heart was left in the sea. It's countless eyes buried under the Memoria Teardrop. Its blood runs through the springs of the Pique Ridge. Its powerful voice echoes through the windswept canyons of the Barranca. And, perhaps, something else trapped below the ice in the northern reaches of Kesh territory in the Verglaz Taiga.

      "description": "In the valley where Juniper lies along a slight river, the Divine Motion has brought her enduring velocity to bear. In front of her, the vanguard of her Black Century, the tip of an endless spear. Behind her, the vast machinery of the greatest military power in the history of life itself. And in her sights, unworthy prey: The Rapid Evening, a group sent to die for an empire they don't believe in and fractured even in their seditious ambitions. This week on PARTIZAN: BITTER AIR - COMBUSTION ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Red Fennecs: Technically, the Red Fennecs are an Apostolosian logistics and transport squad. In actuality, they're utilized by their commanding officer, Tes'ili Serikos, as the backbone of a humble smuggling operation. The Black Century: Infamous retinue of the Divine Motion. Each member of this 100-person company serves for 100 years. Motion guarantees them this service. House Whitestar: A generation ago, House Whitestar was a footnote: A noble house in name alone, with an ancient (and novel) connection to Apostolos. But then a scion of their house was elected as Princept. Now, they have a little weight to throw around and a chip on their shoulder. Home to the virtuoso strategist Lucia Whitestar. House Chasmata: The Chasmata family has governed Stel Kesh's holdings for as long as Kesh has had holdings on Partizan. But in the last century, the family seems more interested in an archeological dig in the northern ice cap than in managing its estates. This has not, unfortunately for Apostolos, limited the amount of military might that Chasmata can bring to bear in an emergency. The Pact of Necessary Venture: The Pact of Necessary Venture: Though they trace their lineage back to an exploratory committee founded in the late 14th century of the Perfect Millenium, the Pact was not made in earnest until five years ago in 1418 PM, soon after hostilities began between Kesh and Apostolos. It's original leadership committee, ████████, ███████, ████████, ███, and Hyacinth determined that to ensure the future stability of the Principality, ███ ████ █████ █████████ █ █████ ████ ██ ███ ████████████████ ███, █████ a vast fleet █████ ███ ███████████ █████████ █████, ███ █████ ████ ████████ ███ ██ █████, █████████ ███ ████ ████ █ █████████ ███████ ████████████ ████ ████ ███████. //People\\\\ Tes'ili Serikos (they/them, tes/tes') : This Apostolosian transport specialist, black marketeer, and Tes'ili Serikos can get just about anything just about anywhere, for a price. Short, round, fuzzy, and good natured… unless you screw tes over. A.O. Rooke (he/him): Former Stel Orion mercenary, now commander of the Rapid Evening's \"toughs\" squad. Hyacinth (they/them): Elect of Motion. Serving in their 99th year, Hyacinth is nearing the end of their tenure in the Black Century. Gur Sevraq (he/them): Leader of the Church of the Resin Heart. Reported miracle worker. Currently in Rapid Evening custody. Has possession of the Divine Future, which gives them startling prescience and the ability to imagine futures outside of the confines of the hegemonic and imperialist world around him. Lucia Whitestar (she/her): \" Lady Whitestar\" is Clementine's peer, emerging strategic genius, and eighth in line to the throne of Princept. Leading the operation to breach Fort Icebreaker. Alberz Chasmata (he/him): Lord Chasmata operates all of his house's military operations on Partizan. Given the house's military strength, that makes him among the moon's most influential people. //Places\\\\ Fort Icebreaker: Fort Icebreaker isn't a fort so much as what might be called the \"main line of resistance\" separating Kesh from Apostolos across a 500 mile stretch of Partizan. Despite its name, Fort Icebreaker comprises hundreds of military facilities, including watchtowers, artillery emplacements, anti-armor barriers, an array of advanced surveillance systems, and 12 major bases. That isn't to say that there isn't also A Fort Icebreaker, though: Icebreaker Prime is real and it is massive, an arsenal, garrison, airfield, and a firebase all rolled into one. Worse: It moves. Icebreaker Prime is a rumbling land carrier which prowls the tundra armed with innumerable weapons and housing over ten thousand of Apostolos' most skilled soldiers. And, worst of all, it does not only move across the ground, but below it, too. Point Juniper: One of the two central bases in Fort Icebreaker's long line, but also the weakest of them. Partially, that's because any base with a river running through it is going to be weaker by virtue of being a little more porous. But also because, as one of the central fortresses, it's also one of the most easily reinforced. Barranca : To the north of Obelle lies the Apostolosian province of Barranca, where mediterranian subtropical shores give way to a vast latticework of ravines and crags. There, military bases and civilian settlements sit in the crooks and alcoves, shaded by high canyon walls. Rising above it all is the famed Barranca Loop, a massive suspended cable system that runs up above the atmosphere like a giant bridge, and which allows Apostolos to launch ships and cargo into space. Heavily patrolled and under complete control of Stel Apostolos. The Verglaz Taiga: Wrapped around the northern latitudes of Partizan, the Verglaz is a beauty to take in, at least from the comfort of the palatial Kesh estates which dot its wooded expanses. From the smaller villages and towns, where feudal tenants huddle for warmth in the snow, whatever aesthetic pleasure the taiga may offer the rich is lost. In the south west, though, a new source of warmth has made its presence known: The burning engine of the Apostolosian war machine, which melts the ice away with artillery barrage and crashed mech, both. Lion's Rest : A bustling seaside port town, housing hundreds of thousands of civilians along with the bulk of the Apostolosian navy and diplomatic forces. //Divines\\\\ The Divine Future: An ancient divine, dating back to the second major war in the Golden Branch star sector. Exists in the form of golden orb slightly larger than a softball or bocce ball, which can either be carried by or hover around its Elect. Offers its chosen unparalleled perspective on the hopes and dreams of themselves and others, and the endless vigor with which to pursue them. Stolen by Gur Sevraq from ████████, █████████ of ███ ████ ██ █████████ ███████. The Divine Motion: Long after enemy fuel tanks run empty, Motion continues to power Apostolosian machines of war (like its infamous retinue, the Black Century) and service (including the massive Barranca Loop that allows Apostolos to regularly launch ships spaceward). //Things\\\\ Old Glory: Sovereign Immunity's hallow, a modified Singh Sisters Wheel Service & Heavy Industry Ltd. \"Deltoid\" model. Used for rapid agricultural construction, able to create small shelters in minutes, and large modular structures in a matter of hours instead of days. Able to rapidly create barricades with large construction panels. Wields a spike-planting gun and a scythe, the latter of which was appropriated from an agricultural hollow. Once featured the icon of the Shepherd's Crook, but this was melted by a flamethrower, then removed, leaving behind the negative space of the symbol instead of a scorch mark. Blessed by Future. Panther: Clementine's hallow, an ancient mech piloted by a near mythological hero of a war barely remembered. Medium sized, black, humanoid, angular, and birdlike in some elements of its design. In another life, it could split itself up into independently flying microwings, each of which could serve as a flanking weapon. Its current pilot can not conceive of using it in this way. Blessed by Future. Stray Dog : Million's hallow, a Zenith-A Project Katalepsis prototype model, stolen when she went AWOL from GLORY. Medium-sized and humanoid in base shape, but able to rearrange its body to accommodate the rail gun built into the torso and left arm. Each limb is double jointed with sleek black and silver plating. There is only one glowing eye on the head, which houses the Stray Dog's aiming systems and pilot. Blessed by Future. Heads Up : Exeter Leap's hallow, a re-fitted Emergentec Rapid Response Type III Breaching Ambulance which he has converted for criminal purposes. Large cylindrical legs taper upwards towards the head. Armored fists and a back mounted mortar. Blessed by Future. AdArm Cast: This surveillance hollow is mostly used by Stel Nideo, where it features angelic (and grotesque) features. But in its Kesh variation, this mirror-coated, humanoid mech's wings are stylized as long claymores instead of feather-y wings, and its body a noble knight instead of celestial seraphim. Just above its mouth, its head becomes an AWACS-esque flat sensor disc. AdArm Shrewdness: These modified Troop units have been retrofitted for long range combat, with lock-on missile launchers and only short range chest vulcans for anti-infantry and close-range combat. Zenith-A Project Kosmos: Designed by the Columnar Zenith Fund for Apostolosian use, these hefty hollows are designed for melee supremacy. Their bulky, reverse jointed legs allow them to explode with speed into close range (where they can do serious damage with their long heat glaives), or to hold their ground from incoming assaults (supported by the stock, circular shield each unit wields). The cost of this strength is a lack of versatility: Between the added articulation and pre-programmed combat routines required for the elaborate weapon use these hollows are known for, there simply wasn't room left for any serious ranged weaponry. AdAm Cackle: Designed to disorient enemies with their quick speeds and to finish off weakened units, the Cackle is a four legged model named for a group of hyenas. Their side-mounted rockets can be used for additional acceleration or as holdout munitions, but their primary weapons are their sharp claws and the heavy cannons on their backs. AdArm Wake: Adamant Arms and Artifice isn't known for building particularly maneuverable units, and these heavy flight mechs are evidence of that, as they hover through the sky more than soar. But between the information provided by their altitude, their added armor, and their unpredictable armaments, they remain a force to be reckoned with. When they launch their tethered, magnetic talons at a foe, there is rarely time to adjust. Soon enough, their foes are lifted into the air and dropped, soft-side first, into the hardest surface available. Z-A Project Pneuma Prototype: The Pnuema is an experimental model based on the basic design ethos first explored with the Z-A Kosmos. Instead of being focused on extreme close range, the Pneuma is meant to dominate the battlefield as a heavyweight, mid-range commander. Despite its increased scale, large ovoid vernier engines allow it a great deal of mobility, making it an intimidating machine to face--even more so when you take into account the fact that its heat glave has been affixed with a pump-action rocket launcher. If that wasn't enough, this particular model creaks and groans with Divine potential... //Additional Notes\\\\ Primary Objective: After House Chasmata attacks Fort Icebreaker at the northwestern point Spruce, capture and hold central point Juniper long enough for Lucia Whitestar to break through Fort Icebreaker at southeastern point Pine. Prevent Fort Icebreaker from reaching Point Pine at any cost . Secondary Objective: Provide the documentary team with enough footage to increase your reputation. ROE: Capture and detain all POWs. Harm no one captured, but let none flee to spread the word. Future's Hallowed: In your vehicle, when you get a 4+ result on a roll, you can remove the highest die to refresh your Spark (this can turn a success into failure, or crit into a normal success if the two 6s are the only successful dice). Spend your spark to change a failed roll into a partial success.

      "description": "At the northwest reaches of the extended defensive perimeter known as Fort Icebreaker, Kesh brigades engage in a feint so convincing that the graves have already been dug. To the southeast, the bulk of the Stel's might on Partizan waits for the signal to roll through the weakest point in Apostolos' line. And in the middle, as if the axle of a wheel, is the Rapid Evening, a river, and a bastion called Juniper. Here rests the fate of the early days of this new offensive. From the hills to the south, the fog begins to roll in. This week on PARTIZAN: BITTER AIR - THREECARD ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Red Fennecs: Technically, the Red Fennecs are an Apostolosian logistics and transport squad.

Each member of this 100-person company serves for 100 years. Motion guarantees them this service. House Whitestar: A generation ago, House Whitestar was a footnote: A noble house in name alone, with an ancient (and novel) connection to Apostolos. But then a scion of their house was elected as Princept. Now, they have a little weight to throw around and a chip on their shoulder. Home to the virtuoso strategist Lucia Whitestar.

      "description": "In the weeks since Kesh's new offensive into Apostolos territory, little has changed besides the quantity of weekly war casualties. Halting Kesh's push is Fort Icebreaker, a massive defensive line composed of a dozen smaller forts, an intricate tunnel system, and a massive moving fortress called Icebreaker Prime which stalks along the border, rejecting any intruders with overwhelming force. But that will change today, says Kesh leadership. Organized by tactical prodigy Lucia Whitestar, a complex ploy is put into action. House Chasmata, strongest of Kesh's noble families on Partizan, will lead their vast ground force in a feint maneuver to Icebreaker's northwest edge. Lucia, meanwhile, will lead the combined forces of the remaining houses at the Fort's opposite end in the southeast. It's an old plan, one that hasn't worked in five years of war, nor the occasional skirmish prior. But this time, there is a final twist: The Rapid Evening. Driven into the fray by A.O. Rooke's boisterous bragging, the group has been given a difficult task: Capture one of the smaller fortresses in the center of the defensive line and hold the returning Icebreaker Prime for long enough that Lucia's army can breach the southern defenses and finally secure a foothold deeper into Apostolosian territory. WIth the gravity of the task at hand, the members of the Rapid Evening look for any advantage they can get. Information. Family. Prayer. This week on PARTIZAN: BITTER AIR - BEHEST ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ Swordbreakers: Blessed by Commitment and led by Cas'alear Rizah, the adopted sibling of the Apokine & Princept, they're known across the war as legend killers who punch above their weight. Serpent's Head: Grand Admiral Phy'lon Antiphony and their fleet serves double duty as both naval powerhouse and lead diplomatic corp for Apostolos' forces on Partizan. They wear the name like a dare. House Whitestar: A generation ago, House Whitestar was a footnote: A noble house in name alone, with an ancient (and novel) connection to Apostolos. But then a scion of their house was elected as Princept. Now, they have a little weight to throw around and a chip on their shoulder. Home to the virtuoso strategist Lucia Whitestar. House Chasmata: The Chasmata family has governed Stel Kesh's holdings for as long as Kesh has had holdings on Partizan. But in the last century, the family seems more interested in an archeological dig in the northern ice cap than in managing its estates. This has not, unfortunately for Apostolos, limited the amount of military might that Chasmata can bring to bear in an emergency. The Curtain of Divinity: Though Kesh is technically governed through an elaborate parliamentary democracy, the truth is that The Curtain of Divinity, a secretive organization inside of the Stel (and with agents across all of the Principality), serves as the actual power behind the throne. Knowledge of the Curtain is carefully guarded, and its membership is even further protected. //People\\\\ Cas'alear Rizah (cas/cas', they/them): Leader of the Swordbreakers. Reputation as being beautiful and brave by allies, unflinching and unpredictable by foes. Pilots the notorious Ataraxia. Previously fought against the Oxblood Clan in Obelle and negotiated with Clementine Kesh during the recovery of Past. Crysanth Kesh (she/her) : Clementine Kesh's mother. Third in line to the throne of Kesh. As Gabardine of the Curtain of Divinity, Crysanth is the highest ranking member of the Curtain on Partizan. Gur Sevraq (he/them): Leader of the Church of the Resin Heart. Reported miracle worker. Currently in Rapid Evening custody. Has possession of the Divine Future, which gives them startling prescience and the ability to imagine futures outside of the confines of the hegemonic and imperialist world around him. Lucia Whitestar (she/her): \" Lady Whitestar\" is Clementine's peer, emerging strategic genius, and eighth in line to the throne of Princept. Leading the operation to breach Fort Icebreaker. Alberz Chasmata (he/him): Lord Chasmata operates all of his house's military operations on Partizan.

And, worst of all, it does not only move across the ground, but below it, too. Point Juniper: One of the two central bases in Fort Icebreaker's long line, but also the weakest of them. Partially, that's because any base with a river running through it is going to be weaker by virtue of being a little more porous. But also because, as one of the central fortresses, it's also one of the most easily reinforced. Barranca : To the north of Obelle lies the Apostolosian province of Barranca, where mediterranian subtropical shores give way to a vast latticework of ravines and crags.

Heavily patrolled and under complete control of Stel Apostolos. //Divines\\\\ The Divine Future: An ancient divine, dating back to the second major war in the Golden Branch star sector. Exists in the form of golden orb slightly larger than a softball or bocce ball, which can either be carried by or hover around its Elect. Offers its chosen unparalleled perspective on the hopes and dreams of themselves and others, and the endless vigor with which to pursue them.

The cost of this strength is a lack of versatility: Between the added articulation and pre-programmed combat routines required for the elaborate weapon use these hollows are known for, there simply wasn't room left for any serious ranged weaponry. //Additional Notes\\\\ Primary Objective: After House Chasmata attacks Fort Icebreaker at the northwestern point Spruce, capture and hold central point Juniper long enough for Lucia Whitestar to break through Fort Icebreaker at southeastern point Pine. Prevent Fort Icebreaker from reaching Point Pine at any cost . Secondary Objective: Provide the documentary team with enough footage to increase your reputation. ROE: Capture and detain all POWs. Harm no one captured, but let none flee to spread the word.

      "description": "Content Warning: This episode features discussion of chemical warfare and suffocation. Deep in the Pique Ridge, at the back of a steephead valley, on the edge of the town of Orzen, under the Cathedral of Imperium is an archival facility filled with record of Partizan's greatest secrets. And in its halls, gunfire rings out as HORIZON leader Gucci Garantine, her bodyguard Thetonious, and their collaborator Valence attempt to breach the sanctum's innermost reaches. As below so above, as the ground shakes with the arrival of Orzen's noble defenders, Imperium's Plume, ready to drive HORIZON and their SBBR allies from the city. In the middle of it all, Jesset City and the Oxblood Clan, blooming radicals with a role assigned to them, and another they'd like to play. The stage is set. It is time to draw back the curtain. This week on PARTIZAN: A Revelation in Orzen ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ HORIZON: A radical-reformist group funded by Stel Kesh's House Brightline. Commanded on Partizan by Gucci Garantine. The Partizan Palace: The Palace provides citizens with authorized archival information, approved news reports, art, and entertainment determined to be canonical to the Divine Principality. Oxblood Clan: What started as a group of orphans turned into a labor guild and criminal enterprise with connections across Partizan. Occasionally run rough-and-tumble military ops for extra cash. Allies with SBBR. Imperium's Plume: A Hallow unit blessed by Imperium, one of the very first Divines of the Principality, tasked with inspiring support for Stel Nideo on Partizan by ensuring that even the home of Progressive Asterism remembers the strength of NIdeo's virtue. The Pact of Necessary Venture : Though they trace their lineage back to an exploratory committee founded in the late 14th century of the Perfect Millenium, the Pact was not made in earnest until five years ago in 1418 PM, soon after hostilities began between Kesh and Apostolos. It's original leadership committee, ████████, ███████, ████████, ███, and ████████ determined that to ensure the future stability of the Principality, ███ ████ █████ █████████ █ █████ ████ ██ ███ ████████████████ ███, █████ █ ████ █████ █████ ███ ███████████ █████████ █████, ███ █████ ████ ████████ ███ ██ █████, █████████ ███ ████ ████ █ █████████ ███████ ████████████ ████ ████ ███████. //People\\\\ Amber Haze (she/her): Leader of the Imperium's Plume rear guard unit. Wavy, blonde hair. Officer's uniform in the color of sunset, with a professional cut and adorned with medals awarded in service. Neck and jawline lined with metal. Pilots the Cadenza. Gucci Garantine (she/her) : Leader of HORIZON's efforts on Partizan.. Jesset City (he/him) : Oxblood Clan lieutenant, engineer, and pilot. Meridian Street (she/her) - Gucci Garantine's second in command in HORIZON. Dark lipstick, blue crewcut, expertise in matters logistical and military. Pilots a Yoke. Thetonious aka \"Tone\" (they/them) - Gucci's primary bodyguard, originally served in a Kesh military commando squad. Elite-class expertise in urban combat, infiltration, and rapid escalation tactics. //Places\\\\ Orzen: Deep in the mountains of the Pique Ridge, this city of 75,000 sits at the end of a box canyon. What started as a mining town grew to be a popular destination for both the religious and culturally inclined, as the city is home to a massive cathedral, Divine statuary, and one of the moon's largest theaters. //Divines\\\\ The Divine Imperium: One of the first Divines of the Principality. It has blessed its Hallowed with extended flight capabilities and, in some cases, a burning aura of authority. The Divine Cadence: There is a box on your desk. It is the same box as on hundreds of thousands of other desks across Partizan, regardless of Stel. When you press it, a smooth voice tells you tomorrow's weather, and then plays you a song. An old, familiar one, maybe. Or perhaps a new one, composed there and then, just for you. Your troubles leave your mind. //Things\\\\ The Portcullis System: Once, every 10 days, the Portcullis System activates. A hundred thousand of these massive structures, elongated, city-sized hexagons of stone and circuitry, shudder, shake, and howl all at once. And at the edge of every star system in the Divine Principality, a geyser of liquid energy, red and oppressive, explodes into darkness. Ships emerge from these crimson and white waves. Ships filled with medical supplies and mineral wealth, purveyors of faith and career politicians, censored information and refurbished war machines. The lifeblood of a vibrant, vicious empire. Zenith-N Cadenza: A prototype unit designed for Stel Nideo by the Columnar's Zenith Fund and now blessed by the Divine Imperium, this light Hallow moves with the sound of violins and strikes with the heat and violence of a volcanic eruption. The Cadenza was designed to harass units at midrange with its kusari-fundo-style, magnetic/propulsive chain whips for a long enough time that its shoulder mounted beam cannon can finish the job. Though capable of real flight, the Cadenza and its pilot, Amber Haze, prefer to use the rocket-propelled, magnetic weights on the end of its chains to \"swing\" through urban environments. Though unorthodox, this technique has left many opponents confused long enough for Haze to land the killing blow. AdArm Flock : For years, Adamant Arms and Artifice was known for their rugged, sturdy, and (literally) grounded designs. But with the Zenith Fund's explosion in growth, and their focus on dynamic and maneuverable machines, AdArm found themselves facing clients with new demands, which forced them to compete on new unfamiliar territory. Their solution was the surprisingly effective Flock, which goes beyond a simple refit of the Troop and stands as what is fundamentally a new, medium-sized machine. Equipped with a basic flight pack, a retractable axe blade, and a powerful underarm flak cannon, the Flock excels in two main combat roles: FIrst, as aerial harriers, meant to harass ground based foes with long range fire from the safety of the sky. Second, as close range skirmishers, which leap into the fray, deal damage, and escape before their armor gives way. Poetic Cipher: A security system used by Stel Nideo. Requires knowledge not only of up to date passcodes, but also a high level, intuitive understanding of poetic techniques, conventions, and history. Herd: Developed from the basic AdArm Troop design, the Herd's centaur like silhouette is famous to anyone who has faced off against Apostolos. The Troop's bipedal legs have been replaced with piston-driven, heavy quad legs that are able to shift between two modes: Movement (with legs paired parallel like an ungulate, allowing for high speed traversal or charges) or combat (spread in a wide cross shape for stability in firing or traversal, moving like a spider). Armed with heavy shoulder cannon, and spears that can be used for both melee combat and as javelin-like explosive projectiles. Yoke: The Oxblood Clan's unique, further customized Herds. Though they cannot transform into the Herd's \"combat\" mode, they have upgrades that allow them to serve a unique command and operations role when deployed in pairs. Their heads feature unique horn sensors which can generate battlefield map data and targeting assistance when two Yokes can provide complete data. Wields a giant fortress shield in left hand, a kanabo in the right, and a vertical missile pod on back. //Additional Notes\\\\ SBBR's Objectives: Primary - Escort Gucci Garantine into the Palace facility and safely secure her extraction. Secondary - Maintain ruse for length of mission. Rules of Engagement: Do no harm to the Residential district and minimal harm to the Theater (commercial) district. Damage to the Cathedral, Statuary, Quartz district, or Palace Staging interior is acceptable.

      "description": "Eager to refill their coffers, Kal'Mera Broun has brought SBBR to meet Kesh noble (and HORIZON commander) Gucci Garantine, who offers the group a daring opportunity to both make some money and get access--however temporary--to some Stel Nideo state secrets along the way. The target is a secure Palace facility in the canyon city of Orzen, where raw footage is given final review before being shipped off-world for permanent archival. But with Apostolos' Barranca Loop on lockdown, its harder than ever to get things off of Partizan, which means that more material than ever is available in the facility. Plus, with each Stel reinforcing their borders ahead of what feels like inevitable war, this city deep in the Pique Ridge has been left without its usual guards. Where once the noble hallows of Imperium's Plume guarded the people of Orzen (and the Palace staging facility hidden beneath the town), defense has now been contracted to a group of Oxblood Clan mercenaries. Oxblood clan mercenaries with motives and loyalties all their own... This week on PARTIZAN: Deception in the Canyon City ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ HORIZON: In the popular consciousness, HORIZON is a radical, anti-Principality terrorist organization. In actuality, they are a radical-reformist group, which seeks to drive out what it perceives as corruption in an empire that ought be pursuing noble (instead of selfish) ends. Rumored to be funded by Stel Kesh's House Brightline. The Partizan Palace: Across Divinity, the Palace provides citizens with authorized archival information, approved news reports (kept up to date locally by the day, galactically by the week), and art and entertainment determined to be canonical to the Divine Principality. Oxblood Clan: What started as a group of orphans turned into a labor guild and criminal enterprise with connections across Partizan. Occasionally run rough-and-tumble military ops for extra cash. Allies with SBBR. Imperium's Plume: A Hallow unit blessed by Imperium, one of the very first Divines of the Principality, tasked with inspiring support for Stel Nideo on Partizan by ensuring that even the home of Progressive Asterism remembers the strength of NIdeo's virtue. //People\\\\ Gucci Garantine (she/her) : AKA Saint Dawn. Vassal and political attache to House Brightline of Stel Kesh. She and House Brightline reportedly have ties to the \"reformist\" (read: terrorist) organization HORIZON. Rivals with Clementine Kesh, and contact of Kal'mera Broun. Jesset City (he/him) : Previously worked for Adamant Arms and Manufacturing, Jesset became full time Oxblood Clan lieutenant (and rising star) after his participation in the fateful mission in Obelle. Expert technician, rapidly developing hollow pilot, and Cipher Certified by Stel Nideo. Utilizes prostheses on his right arm, switching between an affordable myoelectric model with grip hooks and a custom model specifically designed for interfacing with a hollow cockpit. Pilots a Yoke. Meridian Street (she/her) - Gucci Garantine's second in command in HORIZON. Dark lipstick, blue crewcut, expertise in matters logistical and military. Pilots a Yoke. Thetonious aka \"Tone\" (they/them) - Gucci's bodyguard. Aram Nideo (he/him): Often called the \"The Father of Asterism,\" Aram Nideo penned the \"Many Stars Argument,\" which became the backbone not only for the Divine Principality's faith but also its governmental structure. Posthumously awarded Divine status. //Places\\\\ Pique Ridge: Territory controlled by Stel Nideo on Partizan. East of the Prophet's Sea, comprised of a mountain range which surrounds a vast, low bay. Orzen: Deep in the mountains of the Pique Ridge, this city of 75,000 sits at the end of a box canyon. What started as a mining town grew to be a popular destination for both the religious and culturally inclined, as the city is home to a massive cathedral, Divine statuary, and one of the moon's largest theaters. //Things\\\\ Perspective Bleeding: Once, before they were a Stel, the Columnar would collect and join together the thoughts of hundreds, thousands, or even millions, to arrive at policy decisions. This \"Perspective Blending\" was the heart of a democratic system that has been eradicated. In its place is the edgily-named \"Perspective Bleeding,\" which offers a taste of that experience for just a few credits, if you know the right person. In Orzen, Gucci Garantine uses a Perspective Bleeding device not to relax or explore the consciousness of others, but to temporarily gain access to the skillset of someone else. Poetic Cipher: A security system used by Stel Nideo. Requires knowledge not only of up to date passcodes, but also a high level, intuitive understanding of poetic techniques, conventions, and history. Herd: Developed from the basic AdArm Troop design, the Herd's centaur like silhouette is famous to anyone who has faced off against Apostolos. The Troop's bipedal legs have been replaced with piston-driven, heavy quad legs that are able to shift between two modes: Movement (with legs paired parallel like an ungulate, allowing for high speed traversal or charges) or combat (spread in a wide cross shape for stability in firing or traversal, moving like a spider). Armed with heavy shoulder cannon, and spears that can be used for both melee combat and as javelin-like explosive projectiles. Yoke: The Oxblood Clan's unique, further customized Herds. Though they cannot transform into the Herd's \"combat\" mode, they have upgrades that allow them to serve a unique command and operations role when deployed in pairs. Their heads feature unique horn sensors which can generate battlefield map data and targeting assistance when two Yokes can provide complete data. Wields a giant fortress shield in left hand, a kanabo in the right, and a vertical missile pod on back. Wave Fried Art: An underground creative technique mainstreamed by Columnar musicians and performance artists Jerica Vault and Roland Tenten on their \"Wave Fried\" tour, which involves either creating something susceptible to standard Perennial Wave interference or else intentionally exposing something to a high degree of Wave. Regardless of method, the intent is to create a unique work that explores the boundaries of the Wave and makes more visible the context that delimit all artistic production. //Additional Notes\\\\ SBBR's Objectives: Primary - Escort Gucci Garantine into the Palace facility and safely secure her extraction. Secondary - Maintain ruse for length of mission. Rules of Engagement: Do no harm to the Residential district and minimal harm to the Theater (commercial) district.

      "description": "Content Warning: This episode features injury, surgery, and infection. With Gur Sevraq retrieved (and secreted away inside of the Winter Palace), the Rapid Evening ought to have earned themselves reprieve. But with the drums of war beating, an overeager member of the crew volunteers them for a difficult new mission. With this added pressure, Clementine Kesh pushes herself to get back on her feet as quickly as possible, while her crew uses what time they find to continue pursuing their own goals. This week on PARTIZAN: A Captive Audience ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Curtain of Divinity: Though Kesh is technically governed through an elaborate parliamentary democracy, the truth is that The Curtain of Divinity, a secretive organization inside of the Stel (and with agents across all of the Principality), serves as the actual power behind the throne. Knowledge of the Curtain is carefully guarded, and its membership is even further protected. It is unclear (even to the vast majority of the organization's members) how, when, and why the Curtain was founded, but its fundamental organizational hierarchy is a key part of one's induction into the society. The Curtain keeps a simple, cell-based hierarchy, with individual worlds reporting up to star sectors, which then report up to the highest tier of command. At each tier there may be countless operatives, but each reports to one of five key figures in their tier: The Silk: Minister in charge of Curtain diplomatic corps. Commands undercover agents who have infiltrated foreign governments. The Damask: Philosopher, theologian, and scientist whose purview is performing and obtaining heretical and otherwise forbidden material. The Lace: Marshall in command of the Curtain's military forces, including reconnaissance and martial saboteur units. The Linen: Steward, Quartermaster, Armorer, Bookkeeper. In charge of industrial espionage. The Gabardine: Chief spymaster, keeper of all information, and (traditionally) the executive who proposes large scale, cross-branch action. Each planet and/or sector has their own chief operatives in these roles, which roll up to the top, Divinity-wide tier. When referenced in speech or text, the operatives use only these titles, e.g. \"The Lace of Partizan\" or \"The Gabardine of Divinity.\" House Brightline / HORIZON: In the popular consciousness, HORIZON is a radical, anti-Principality terrorist organization. In actuality, they are a radical-reformist group, which seeks to drive out what it perceives as corruption in an empire that ought be pursuing noble (instead of selfish) ends. Secretly funded by Stel Kesh's House Brightline. Its Partizan branch is commanded by Gucci Garantine. The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of Logos Kantel's religious mission. The \"resin heart\" in question is a 3-foot large object pulled from the sea 400+ years ago and displayed as a relic by the Church. //People\\\\ Audacious Opportunity (A.O.) Rooke (he/him) : Was a young freelance mercenary operating under Stel Orion charter before being captured by Stel Kesh on an assignment deep behind enemy lines. Now commands the Rapid Evening's infantry division. Figure A (they/them): A synthetic being that once worked inside of the Divine Past, working to make the data the Divine had available to it more understandable by other people. : Crysanth Kesh (she/her) : Clementine Kesh's mother. Third in line to the throne of Kesh. As Gabardine of the Curtain of Divinity High ranking member of The Curtain, the highest such on Partizan itself. See The Curtain of Divinity above for more. The Winter Doctor (he/him): Dr. Schuyler has been making visits to the Winter Palace for decades. Now he does so for Clementine Kesh. //Places\\\\ Fort Icebreaker: A mobile fortress and battle station which patrols the northeastern border with Kesh. Moves between a dozen different smaller, subterranean bases, each of which is connected to a network of underground transport tunnels. In some sense, this entire system is \"Fort Icebreaker.\" The Verglaz Taiga: Wrapped around the northern latitudes of Partizan, the Verglaz is a beauty to take in, at least from the comfort of the palatial Kesh estates which dot its wooded expanses. From the smaller villages and towns, where feudal tenants huddle for warmth in the snow, whatever aesthetic pleasure the taiga may offer the rich is lost. In the south west, though, a new source of warmth has made its presence known: The burning engine of the Apostolosian war machine, which melts the ice away with artillery barrage and crashed mech, both. Cruciat: The Jewel of Kesh's holdings on Partizan (and the home of the Stel's Winter Palace) sits on a cross shaped island in the northernmost reaches of the Prophet's Sea The Winter Palace : Owned and managed by House Kesh, but eternal \"home\" to the Princept, whether they choose to visit or not. Built for privacy and access, featuring both its own port and trainyard. Barranca : To the north of Obelle lies the Apostolosian province of Barranca, where mediterranian subtropical shores give way to a vast latticework of ravines and crags. There, military bases and civilian settlements sit in the crooks and alcoves, shaded by high canyon walls. Rising above it all is the famed Barranca Loop, a massive suspended cable system that runs up above the atmosphere like a giant bridge, and which allows Apostolos to launch ships and cargo into space. Heavily patrolled and under complete control of Stel Apostolos. //Things\\\\ The Divine Future: An ancient divine, dating back to the second major war in the Golden Branch star sector. Exists in the form of golden orb slightly larger than a softball or bocce ball, which can either be carried by or hover around its Elect. Offers its chosen unparalleled perspective on the hopes and dreams of themselves and others, and the endless vigor with which to pursue them. The Divine Vernacular: A Stel Nideo Divine which allows those loyal (and blessed) to communicate instantly, at distance. A power some say is more powerful than even the sharpest spearhead. \"The True Divine\": A phrase found in some Progressive Asterists texts and doctrine, but also across heterodox and heretical religious creeds and in of the teachings of gnostic and esoteric secret societies.

      "description": "With the \"kidnapping\" of Gur Sevraq spread far and wide, each Stel on Partizan spins up for war—even though some have not yet decided who they will come to blows with. In the heat of this moment, the Isles of Logos have become more important than ever, with shipments passing through the port and transports stopping to refuel on route to some combat maneuver. But for the Disciples of Logos on the island, whose leader has seemingly vanished not once, but twice, these developments have earned even greater concern. Unsure of Sevraq's location, the Church of the Resin Heart requests aid from the Society of Banners and Bright Returns, who use the trip to the isles to find their own relief… and profit. This week on PARTIZAN: A Call From an Island ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Isles of Logos: An independent nation built by the followers of the prophet Logos Kantel's around their very first church. Though only a small handful of islands in the Prophet's Sea, the Isles keep a standing defense force that rivals any individual unit of the Major Stels. Asterism: Split into two major sects (Received and Progressive), the state religion of the Divine Principality. The Disciples of Logos: A small sect, technically of Progressive Asterists, who believe that Progressive Asterism itself operates under a misunderstanding of the prophet Logos Kantel's words. Membership spans Divinity, but remains miniscule in size compared to even other Progressive Asterist sects. The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of the prophet's religious mission. The \"resin heart\" in question is a 3-foot large object pulled from the sea 400+ years ago and displayed as a relic by the Church. The Friends of Gur Sevraq: The name given to the current membership of the Church of the Resin heart, who follow the teachings of a new prophet, Gur Sevraq, who has reportedly performed a number of miracles. They teach the value of and need for open communication between regular members of the principality, and dream of a galactic-communications network which would allow people to send messages between worlds in a matter of seconds or minutes instead of days, weeks, or months. Strand Semaphore: Using ancient Hyphan technology, this messenger service is able to send text-based communications to anywhere on-moon, so long as they've built an outpost there. HORIZON: In the popular consciousness, HORIZON is a radical, anti-Principality terrorist organization. In actuality, they are a radical-reformist group, which seeks to drive out what it perceives as corruption in an empire that ought be pursuing noble (instead of selfish) ends. Rumored to be funded by Stel Kesh's House Brightline. The Nobel: The people and culture from which Valence originates. They live beyond Partizan, in the Scutum-Centaurus arm of the Milky Way, which a past Princept declared was not to be colonized or even explored. But years ago they suffered an attack from someone from the Divine Principality. Valence seeks to answer how, who, and why. The Rapid Evening: Secret \"protectors\" of Gur Sevraq. //People\\\\ Avar (they/them) and Ryrira (she/her): Gur Sevraq's chief of security and quartermaster, respectively. Have a child, M'reb. Apparatus Aperitif (they/them): Logos City, the largest independent city on Partizan, is known as a religious center, but its robotic night mayor ensures that everyone has a good time at the end of their time traveling the Prophet's Path. Gucci Garantine (she/her) : Vassal and political attache to House Brightline of Stel Kesh. She and House Brightline reportedly have ties to the \"reformist\" (read: terrorist) organization HORIZON. Rivals with Clementine Kesh, and contact of Kal'mera Broun. Kenzington \"Kenzi\" Be (she/her) : Commanding Officer of the Columnar 301st Appraisal Unit. Previously a high ranking member of Columnar military, demoted after she refused an order. Was defeated by SBBR during their last deployment. //Places\\\\ Logos City : Capital of the Isles of Logos //Things\\\\ The Strand: A technology once used by the ancient Hyphan people to travel, without Portcullis technology, from system to system.

      "description": "From the midst of a sandstorm, hands burst through the tempest in search of a miracle worker. From the front, the reformed pirate Callister Drive Callister leads his forces—and the unnatural sands—towards the heart of Gur Sevraq's pilgrimage. From the rear, the head of Partizan's largest church, the Song Aleel Verdicate, seeks to employ subtler methods to capture her prey. And in the middle of it all is the Rapid Evening, declaring their presence—and their intentions—as loudly as any who have ever carried the name. This week on PARTIZAN: DESERT SQUIRE - SLEIGHT ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ House Callister: The newest house of Orion, whose status was earned through \"heroism in battle...\" which is to say state-sanctioned piracy. Led by and named for Callister Drive Callister (who was given his new surname simultaneously with his new House), a sometimes ally, sometimes rival of the dreaded Exeter Leap House Bittenbach: \"Before all others.\" Technically, this is Bittenbach's motto because they were the very first noble house in Stel Orion, formed after their founder orchestrated a grand betrayal on behalf of the Principality. Today, though, it is quoted as evidence of the house's legendary hunger for wealth (and their willingness to break norms to satiate it.) The house's holdings on Partizan are operated by Burden Bittenbach. They were originally assigned to operate the Obelle mission in SBBR's place. Now, has sent House Callister to retrieve Gur Sevraq during the pilgrimage. The Wolfwings: This vanguard squad, led by ace pilot Cam'bage Elarune, ensures early-conflict air superiority and secure, long term reconnaissance capabilities for Stel Apostolos. //People\\\\ Aleel Verdicate (she/her): Current Song of Partizan, making her the de facto head of the Church of Received Asterism on the moon. Avar (they/them) and Ryrira (she/her): Gur Sevraq's chief of security and quartermaster, respectively. A-tek (she/her): Callister Drive's butler, bodyguard, and (unfortunately for him) House Bittenbach-assigned handler. There to ensure Drive gets results, and also that he doesn't consider taking the gifts given to him by Bittenbach and running elsewhere. Pilot of the Thaumaturge. //Places\\\\ Museum Row: Before the war struck, an emerging tourism industry had come to Cruciat, and so Kesh invested in dozens of niche museums in the city's commercial district. The North Gallery: Decades before Museum Row was an established destination, the North Gallery collected art about and ephemera from Kesh's original colonization of the Verglaz Taiga on Partizan. //Things\\\\ Thaumaturge: An Occult Project prototype hollow designed for long range engagements. Is able visually conceal itself through an experimental active camouflage. The visibility which is displaced will re-appear to the pilot 2-3 days after the end of engagement. If ocular aberrations continue for more than a week, seek counsel from a licensed practitioner. The Divine Vernacular: A Stel Nideo Divine which allows those loyal (and blessed) to communicate instantly, at distance. A power some say is more powerful than even the sharpest spearhead. The Rings of Vernacular: Disguised as rings, these devices allow the Song of Partizan to listen in to any use of Vernacular's network. Troop: A basic combat hollow designed by Adamant Arms and Artifice and distributed by Stel Orion across the Principality. The Church of the Resin Heart has two, bought from SBBR after the group stole them from Stel Apostolos in Obelle. //Additional Notes\\\\ Rapid Evening's Objective: Escort the pilgrims on their journey from the point of their start to the point of their seabound departure at the eastern coast of the Prophet's path. If Gur Sevraq's life comes into serious danger, rescue them and extract back to Cruciat. Secondary Objective, as delivered to Sovereign Immunity: Secure Gur Sevraq regardless of his condition.

      "description": "With their defense operation underway, the Rapid Evening have moved into position and identified a potential threat in the form of an unnaturally-moving sandstorm. As Sovereign Immunity and Clementine Kesh attempt to ingratiate themselves with the pilgrimage's leadership and re-route the convoy, Exeter Leap and Ver'Million Blue standby in overwatch position. And as the storm grows nearer, it becomes clear that are not alone in their ambitions. But the threats are not only in the sand… This week on PARTIZAN: DESERT SQUIRE - RIPOSTE ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ House Callister: The newest house of Orion, whose status was earned through \"heroism in battle...\" which is to say state-sanctioned piracy.

Now, in exchange for a noble title, he's decided to ply his trade on behalf of Stel Orion. Pilot of the Tempestarii. A-tek (she/her): Callister Drive's butler, bodyguard, and (unfortunately for him) House Bittenbach-assigned handler. There to ensure Drive gets results, and also that he doesn't consider taking the gifts given to him by Bittenbach and running elsewhere. Pilots the Thaumaturge. Swansea See (they/them): An old-school member of Callister's corsair crew. Thanks to Bittenbach technology, has been fully fused into their mech, the Conjurer. \"The Farmer\" (he/him): A popular sobriquet used for the Sovereign Immunity who sometimes goes by the name Byron, who supported an agrarian revolution 13 years ago. AO Rooke (he/him): Audacious Opportunity Rooke was a young Orion merc caught in a daring (and foolhardy) raid against Stel Kesh. Refused to give up his employer and is now paying the price in service to the Rapid Evening as leader of their cohort of toughs. Aleel Verdicate (she/her): Current Song of Partizan, making her the de facto head of the Church of Received Asterism on the moon. //Things\\\\ Tempestarii: A Zenith Fund developed prototype hollow that teems with electromagnetic power, which it can use to create limited, localized weather phenomena. Often seen in its jet from, it can also take a bipedal mode. Something inside of it rumbles with a distant light. One of the hollows \"liberated\" from the Zenith Fund's \"Occult Project\" by Callister Leap, before defecting. Side effects unknown. Conjurer: An stout and sturdy Occult Project prototype hollow designed for both assault and diversion missions. Wields mid-range weaponry and deploys large, hollow-scale hover mines which project duplicate Conjurer units, fooling both sight and sensors. Operation requires total and permanent \"synchronization\" of its pilot with the Conjurer's chassis. Thaumaturge: An Occult Project prototype hollow designed for long range engagements. Is able visually conceal itself through an experimental active camouflage. The visibility which is displaced will re-appear to the pilot 2-3 days after the end of engagement.

      "description": "In a matter of weeks, thousands of Kesh hollows will slide down the icy hills of the Verglaz Taiga, weapons raised and spirits on fire, as they charge an Apostolosian line. It will be the start of a new, bloody offensive, a spark that will light the moon aflame, drawing every Stel on the moon into the sort of open conflict that has not been seen in this region since the Principality first conquered it. But that hasn't happened yet. Today, Clementine Kesh awakes in her bed, sun shining through her windows, with a choice to make. Where will she and her \"team\" of incarcerated soldiers go next? This week on PARTIZAN: DESERT SQUIRE - VANTAGE ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Church of Received Asterism: The most widely practiced faith in the galaxy, and one of the earliest major organizations in the Divine Principality, created at the beginning of the Miraculous Millenium, over 3000 years ago. Teaches that Divines, the immortal machines and mechs that helped establish the Principality's hold on the galaxy, reflect the best aspects of the state itself. The divine Strength, in other words, is like a living flag of the Principality's own strength. Organized as a central church, led by a religious leader named a \"Cycle,\" whose will is enacted across the Principality by their many \"Songs,\" who rule worlds, star systems, or sometimes entire constellations. The Church of Progressive Asterism: Created as the teachings of the prophet Logos Kantel grew in popularity 1000 years ago, and made a secondary state religion in order to prevent a large schism. Teaches that Divines are true embodiments of their names, and that the citizens and states of the Principality should look to them as guiding stars. The Divine Strength, in other words, is a reflection of strength itself, or maybe \"god's strength,\" and we should aspire to make our strength look like the divine's. Unlike Received Asterism, there is no single central church, but hundreds of smaller sects, schools, and cults, each devoted to individual Divines, grouped sub-pantheons, or otherwise adjusted beliefs. The Disciples of Logos: A small sect, technically of Progressive Asterists, who believe that Progressive Asterism itself operates under a misunderstanding of the prophet Logos Kantel's words. Membership spans Divinity, but remains miniscule in size compared to even other Progressive Asterist sects. The Church of the Resin Heart: A Disciples of Logos church on Partizan which claims to be the true inheritor of the prophet's religious mission. The \"resin heart\" in question is a 3-foot large object pulled from the sea 400+ years ago and displayed as a relic by the Church. The Friends of Gur Sevraq: The name given to the current membership of the Church of the Resin heart, who follow the teachings of a new prophet, Gur Sevraq, who has reportedly performed a number of miracles. They teach the value of and need for open communication between regular members of the principality, and dream of a galactic-communications network which would allow people to send messages between worlds in a matter of seconds or minutes instead of days, weeks, or months. The Shepherd's Crook: A sect inside of Received Asterism which began soon after the founding of the church as a collection of monks who provided safety and service to then-new colonies… in exchange for wealth and power. Though their extortionist tendencies (and military might) was reined in by the central church, they remain a group focused on local communities rather than central bureaucracy or dogma. They've also become the home of the Sovereign Immunities, an elite rank of political advisor which carries the freedom to speak directly when others would be censored and which is offered a high degree of diplomatic immunity. Lambic House: A group of beer-brewing monks who both operate a brewery and manage a sizable civilian settlement deep in the mountains of the Pique Ridge. //People\\\\ Logos Kantel (they/them): The prophet who, it is said, brought life to the once barren moon of Partizan. Gur Sevraq (he/them): Current leader of the Church of the Resin Heart. Reported miracle worker. Secretly has possession of the Divine Future, which gives him startling prescience and the ability to imagine futures outside of the confines of the hegemonic and imperialist world around him. Leading the pilgrimage down the Prophet's Path. Alise Breka (she/her): Guest lecturer at Verglaz University and Author of popular Renegade Hearts pulp series, which tells stories of daring and romantic Hallow pilots. On Partizan to research her next book, partly by interviewing the imprisoned pirate Exeter Leap. Aleel Verdicate (she/her): Current Song of Partizan, making her the de facto head of the Church of Received Asterism on the moon. The Blossom (he/him): The Lambic House is just supposed to make beer, sell it around the world, and keep people happy. But with each keg delivered by the sect's Abbot of Provision, the Blossom also serves a short, populist whisper. Avar (they/them): The Friends of Gur Sevraq are often idealistic and naive about the world. But Chief of Security Avar, who was stationed at Westhaven for years and fought against Fort Icebreaker before finding their way to the faith, knows that the path to heaven is treacherous. Partner of Ryrira and parent of one child, M'reb. Ryrira (she/her): Quartermaster of the Church of the Resin Heart and Avar's partner. Mother of one child, M'reb. //Places\\\\ The Prophet's Sea: A massive ocean that dominates the center of most maps of Partizan. It is said that the sea was made by the prophet Logos Kantel in their first miracle, after walking the length of its radius and climbing a set of hills that would soon become islands. The Prophet's Path: An autonomous region to the west of the Prophet's Sea, south of Apostolosian territory and north of Orion. These dusty badlands are dotted with small villages, farms, and other settlements. Its furthest, most western reaches are untouched by Kantel's miracle. In order to celebrate the millennial anniversary of Logos Kantel's arrival, the Church of the Resin Heart is traveling a pilgrimage on the route the prophet once took. The Isles of Logos: An independent nation built by the followers of the prophet Logos Kantel's around their very first church. Though only a small handful of islands in the Prophet's Sea, the Isles keep a standing defense force that rivals any individual unit of the Major Stels. Pique Ridge: Territory controlled by Stel Nideo on Partizan. East of the Prophet's Sea, comprised of a mountain range which surrounds a vast, low bay. //Things\\\\ The Divine Vernacular: A Stel Nideo Divine which allows those loyal (and blessed) to communicate instantly, at distance. A power some say is more powerful than even the sharpest spearhead. The Song's Rings: Disguised as rings, these devices allow the Song of Partizan to listen in to any use of Vernacular's network. //Additional Notes\\\\ Rapid EveniNg's Objective: Escort the pilgrims on their journey from the point of their start to the point of their seabound departure at the eastern coast of the Prophet's path. If Gur Sevraq's life comes into serious danger, rescue them and extract back to Cruciat. Secondary Objective, as delivered to Sovereign Immunity: Secure Gur Sevraq regardless of his condition.

      "description": "After their initial gambit found success, the members of SBBR have put Columnar's too-curious 301st Appraisal Unit off balance. Now, they seek to finish the deal--but to do so in such a way that will not draw more attention and ire towards the Sable Court, who has hired them. And if they can succeed, they may yet find that while the Great Stels of the Principality pay well, covens hidden in the woods offer more than simple currency in reward for loyalty. This week on PARTIZAN: Under the Boughs of the Court ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Nobel: The people and culture from which Valence originates. They live beyond Partizan, in the Scutum-Centaurus arm of the Milky Way, which a past Princept declared was not to be colonized or even explored. But years ago they suffered an attack from someone from the Divine Principality. Valence seeks to answer how, who, and why. //People\\\\ Eiden Teak (he/him) : Soldier and commander in the Sable Court. Wears the wounds of past fights on him with a distinct sort of pride, inherited from his time fighting as an Apostolosian soldier: He's missing right leg under the knee, and a number of his antlers have been snapped and broken. Wears loose olive drab fatigues, marked the occult insignia and wards of the Court. The Loess (she/her): The leader of the Sable Court stands with a the large, muscular body of a moose more than a deer, and her antlers are no different: wide and domineering, twinkling with not only the normal precious metal inlay used by members of the court, but also with shining, multi-colored gems--memoria--making them look almost more like brightly jeweled butterfly wings than antlers. Her base of operations is, on the outside, hidden by what you can only imagine is incredible advanced technology. You pass through some bushes and above you, a star chart flickers above you. Her voice, heavy, simple, but smart, welcomes you to the heart of the coven. //Things\\\\ The Strand: A technology once used by the ancient Hyphan people to travel, without Portcullis technology, from system to system. Clarified Memoria : The Sable Court has developed a process by which they \"reveal\" the truth of Memoria gems, which allows the already potent material to conjure and confer the miraculous. Zenith-A Kathēkon: Often affectionately called \"Cathies\" by Apostolosian pilots, these medium sized, humanoid mechs were originally designed to be the Zenith Fund's answer to the Troop. Specially built for Apostolosian needs (including night, underwater, and orbital combat), the Kathekon is a flexible fighting platform with fully articulating hands, advanced imaging, and jumpjets designed to allow low, fast horizontal hops. While the Troop still makes up the bulk of the Apostolosian hollow forces, you'll often find Cathies deployed on special ops missions or by unit commanders. Their dark green color, bulbous armor, and large orange \"eyes\" give them an amphibious look--which is (part of) the reason behind Kesh soldiers referring to their Apostolosian foes as \"frogs.\" //Additional Notes\\\\ SBBR's Mission Objectives: Drive the 301st away from the the path towards the Sable Court. Secondary objective: Capture their equipment. Rules of Engagement: Do not trigger any of the Sable Wards which have been placed.

      "description": "Before Cymbidium died, he asked the labor machine Thisbe, whose deerlike design drew from the form of his own people's, for a favor: Deliver a final message to Mourningbride, initiate of the occult group the Sable Court and former Elect. On hearing about this goal, Thisbe's squad members Broun and Valence encourage her to pursue it, and travel with her deep into Columnar territory to meet with the Hyphan witches of the forest. But when they arrive, they find a less welcoming host than expected... This week on PARTIZAN: Ambush in the Sand ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ Stel Columnar: A fence-sitting democracy, made up largely of synthetics on the cutting edge of technology, art, politics, and war. They are tied to the Future. Innovation, style, cowardice. The Sable Court: Some say that on dark nights, they have seen these Ashen witches on the eastern edge of Lake Timea, horns and antlers glittering in the light of Girandole. Some even say that a former elect walks among them. Heresy, all of it. 301st Appraisal Unit : Before the Columnar commits the resources necessary to take something for their own, this small reconnaissance unit comprised of soldiers, engineers, and academics needs to find it 21st Voluntary Composite Division: Unlike most other Stels, Columnar doesn't segregate Hallow and Hollow units, and instead assigns Hallow pilots to officer roles in combined arms divisions like this one. Strand Semaphore: Using ancient Hyphan technology, this messenger service is able to send text-based communications to anywhere on-moon, so long as they've built an outpost there. //People\\\\ Mourningbride (she/her): An initiate in the Sable Court, and a former Elect. Cymbidium (he/him): The deceased Elect of the Divine Past. Gave Thisbe a message to deliver to Mourningbride. Kenzington \"Kenzi\" Be (she/her) : Commanding Officer of the Columnar 301st Appraisal Unit. Has legs that can fold down into tank treds--in some ways, she looks like the humanoid version of Broun's mech, the Three Cheers! Has a long oval torso and a totally spherical head with dozens of cameras on it that sort of extends from her torso. Cobra Junction (he/him) : Humanoid pilot in a flashy, vinyl bomber jacket with gold stripes and is often \"smoking\" synthetic cigars. This facade reflects an insecurity, as Cobra's initial assignment was due to his geological expertise, not his aptitude as a pilot. Dina Dash (they/them) : Wheeled synthetic who carries a clipboard and has magnification lenses that can independently move lower in front of their optics. //Places\\\\ The Memoria Teardrop: A range of mountains and high plains, dense with mineral resources. Named for \"memoria,\" a rare precious material with a high, natural storage capacity. Vigil City: The capital city of of Columnar on Partizan. Sits on the southern end of the \"Teardrop\" on a high plateau. The densest city on Partizan, Vigil City is also the most automated city on the moon. Lake Timea: A small lake to the north of the Memoria Teardrop, surrounded on the north side by a dense forest. Home to the Sable Court. Red Soil: A small beach on the northern side of Lake Timea //Things\\\\ The Perennial Wave: Invisible to the naked eye, the Perennial Wave is made up of a seemingly endless amount of nanomachines which flow out from the center of the galaxy and which deactivate or destroy complex machines and electronics. At any moment, the Wave can be at various degrees of density, which are colloquially referred to as \"high tide\" and \"low tide.\" Bing 32: Broun's floating, cat sized drone able to use a variety of tools. Sable Wards: Through a combination of Memoria and control over the Perennial Wave, the Sable Court is able to create simple, seemingly-invisible wards that alert them of intruders. Zenith-A Kathēkon : Often affectionately called \"Cathies\" by Apostolosian pilots, these medium sized, humanoid mechs were originally designed to be the Zenith Fund's answer to the Troop. Specially built for Apostolosian needs (including night, underwater, and orbital combat), the Kathekon is a flexible fighting platform with fully articulating hands, advanced imaging, and jumpjets designed to allow low, fast horizontal hops. While the Troop still makes up the bulk of the Apostolosian hollow forces, you'll often find Cathies deployed on special ops missions or by unit commanders. Their dark green color, bulbous armor, and large orange \"eyes\" give them an amphibious look--which is (part of) the reason behind Kesh soldiers referring to their Apostolosian foes as \"frogs.\" Zenith-C Wedge : Kathekons recolored in the dark blue and gold of Stel Columnar, and maintained with much higher quality (and experimental) materials. Unlike the Kathekon for Apostolos, the Wedge does make up the bulk of the \"frontline\" hollow squads, and provide security for more vulnerable hollows (and support for more powerful ones). These have flexible armaments. In this case: One wields a flamethrower and an electro-net launcher and one has a heavy machinegun. Both have weaponized, hollow sized chainsaws, as well. Zenith-C Obscura : Wide shoulders that lead down to treaded legs. Can launch dozens of drones into the air for reconnaissance and observation, which will quickly locate anything nearby, but must remain stationery to do that. Can launch micro missiles at locked targets, has small vulcans for infantry and small armored counter attack--does little to close range mechs. The Divine Asepsis : Vigil City is the densest urban settlement on the moon, and yet, every morning, it is spotless. Give thanks to Asepsis' swarm of robotic servants. The Divine Vernacular: Sometimes a divine wields a blade, incomparable in sharpness. Sometimes, as in this Stel Nideo divine, it allows thousands to speak instantly, at distance. You decide which is more frightening. //Additional Notes\\\\ SBBR's Mission Objectives Drive the 301st away from the the path towards the Sable Court. Secondary objective: Capture their equipment. Rules of Engagement: Do not trigger any of the Sable Wards which have been placed.

      "description": "After a successful mission retrieving key remnants of the Divine Past and the body of the Elect Cymbidium, the Rapid Evening has returned to Cruciat, Kesh's capital on Partizan. While the city mourns the loss of an Elect, the crew's members are busy resupplying, repairing their vehicles, and pursuing their own ends. While Clementine Kesh deals with the emotional aftershock of her first command, Sovereign Immunity, Exeter Leap, and Ver'Million Blue test the constraints of their imprisonment and take next steps towards their goals. And then there is the matter of the funeral…. This week on PARTIZAN: A Palace During a Wake ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Curtain: Though Kesh is technically governed through an elaborate parliamentary democracy, the truth is that The Curtain, a secretive organization inside of the Stel, serves as the actual power behind the throne. Knowledge of the Curtain is carefully guarded, and its membership is even further protected. //Places\\\\ Cruciat: The jewel of Kesh's holdings on Partizan (and the home of the Stel's Winter Palace) is this city on a cross shaped island in the northernmost reaches of the Prophet's Sea. Its cruciform shape made the city easily divisible into districts. The long southern arm is given to government, first to miles of civil bureaucracy and then to noble homes along the waterside, and finally to the famous, icelike Winter Palace. To the east, and across some of the nearby islands that dot the coast, the large proletariat cram into homes. On the west, Kesh's military marches in formation and launches naval vessels to probe at Apostolos' borders. The north is industrial, situated so that it can more quickly intake both incoming supplies and outgoing shipments directly from the continent. Finally, the center is a bustling downtown, filled with music, food, shopping, and pleasure of all kinds. It's never quite night time in Cruciat, partly because of its place north on the moon, and partly because the gas lamps saturate the northern fog with white-blue light. It's a color matched by the stonework buildings, whose light grey facades grow darker as you move north, towards the factories. Horses carry nobles whose homes are worth a thousand thousand times the laborers they pass. And the smell of warm stew is in the air. The Winter Palace: Owned and managed by House Kesh, but eternal \"home\" to the Princept, whether they choose to visit or not. Beyond the throne room, there are countless spaces for receiving and entertaining, a lovely and vast garden, and a number of ballrooms for major events. Built for privacy and access, featuring both its own port and trainyard. //Things\\\\ Robotic Utilities and Navigation Tool (RUNT): A floating, coffin-shaped, well-programed hunter-killer robot. Obeys Milli's commands, anticipates her actions, carries her sniper rifle, and wields its own smaller weapons. //Additional Notes\\\\ Mission Reward Math: 4 Supply from 3d6 supply roll (Target's Tier = 3, Employer Faction Status = 0 ), +1 extra personnel and +1trust (from Kesh's government type, Oligarchy/Crytpocracy), +1 materiel from Leap's scavenging Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Sylvia Clare ( @captaintrash ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), and Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( available on bandcamp ) Text by Austin Walker Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "The events in Obelle were disastrous for many, yet for the Society of Banners and Bright Returns, the nighttime raid on the seaside town went down in the book as a win. Now, they return to their home in the heavily stratified metropolis of Oxbridge in the heart of Stel Orion territory. After getting paid and tending to an unforeseen entanglement, the crew spends some time following leads, satiating their curiosity, and shoring up their reputation around town. This is the first session featuring what Forged in the Dark games call \"downtime,\" a phase of the game that is focused on what the characters do between missions. Because it's the first downtime of the season, we spend a little more time than usual going over the rules of play so that everyone can follow along. In the future, we'll summarize as much of the bookkeeping as possible so that we can stay focused on the drama and decision making that makes these sessions sing! This Week on PARTIZAN: Profit and Loss ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ House Bittenbach: \"Before all others.\" Technically, this is Bittenbach's motto because they were the very first noble house in Stel Orion, formed after their founder orchestrated a grand betrayal on behalf of the Principality. Today, though, it is quoted as evidence of the house's legendary hunger for wealth (and their willingness to break norms to satiate it.) The house's holdings on Partizan are operated by Burden Bittenbach. They were originally assigned to operate the Obelle mission in SBBR's place. Carrion Collections: A low ranking scavengers squad with a handful of hollows that operates out of Stel Orion. Called shameless, even (especially) by those who employ them. Has a tense with SBBR due to a dispute over workshop materials. The Isles of Logos: An independent nation built by the original followers of the prophet Logos Kantel's around their very first church, though it has since become a secular and independent state—something largely unheard of inside of Principality space. Though only a small handful of islands in the Prophet's Sea, the Isles keep a standing defense force that rivals any individual squad the Major Stels could throw at them. The Church of the Resin Heart: Among all the sects under the wide umbrella of Progressive Asterism, one group—the Disciples of Logos—is dedicated to the teachings of the movement's supposed founder, the Prophet Logos Kantel. Though there are a handful of Logos-aligned houses faith across the reaches of the Principality, none is as well organized or important as the Church of the Resin Heart, named for the uncanny, 3-foot tall heart that was recovered from the prophet's sea many years ago. The Church, also named the Friends of Gur Sevraq in honor of their enigmatic and charismatic leader, are gaining followers as quickly as their leader can perform miracles. They claim the True God is coming, and seek to spread the word as far as they possibly can. The Sable Court: Some say that on dark nights, they have seen Ashen witches on the eastern edge of Lake Timea, horns and antlers glittering in the light of Girandole. Some even say that a former elect walks among them, though whether she is the one they call the Loess, no one knows. It does not matter. Heresy, all of it. //People\\\\ Midnite Matinee (she/her) : The Leporine leader of Carrion Collections knows she's destined for more. She and her trusty Pack-model light AutoHollow Popcorn (she/her) are going to take what they can get, even if it means stepping on people to get it. Gur Sevraq (he/they): The enigmatic leader of the Church of the Resin Heart. \"Liberated\" the divine Future from Stel Columnar. Has performed a number of seemingly-verified miracles in recent months. Mourningbride (she/her) : An Ashen born to a high ranking family, Mourningbride was once an elect, but left her post and journeyed to the Sable Court after learning about her people's ancient history. With his final act, Cymbidum requested that Thisbe deliver a message to Mourningbride. //Places\\\\ The Low Slate : At its most welcoming, Orion's territory on Partizan is a large, lowland plain covered with warm riverlands. At its most hostile, these are lunar lowlands, as the cratered and barren southern pole of the moon, the one place untouched by the prophet's gift and the life that followed. Across the two is everything that makes Orion what it is: the control of vast spaces, agricultural and mineral wealth, a sense of prideful competition between aligned-yet-dueling city-states. Oxbridge: Most bridges connect land to land, but the enormous Bridge of the Ox connects ocean ports to the docks of largest freshwater lake on the moon. Under this massive bridge rests Oxbridge, a dense city of canals and crimson light, and the first large scale Principality settlement to come to the moon, nearly 1000 years ago. Oxbridge is split into three regions: Brightsky West, Underbridge, and Brightsky East. To the East and West, merchants, nobles, and the ever-upwardly mobile live, work, shop and play. But below the bridge's shadow is an undercity of laborers both local and transient, eking by from job to job, day to day, by the fuel of their effort and the light of the red, phosphorescent \"lamps\" that give Underbridge its distinct glow, even in daytime. Connecting it all together are a network of waterways, roads, and secret tunnels. And above it all is the Bridge of the Ox, the symbol of Orion's commitment to (and mastery of) brute-force ideology. The Pique Ridge: The mountainous region controlled by Stel Nideo, which rests northeast of Orion territory and west of Stel Columnar's home on Partizan, the Memoria Teardrop. Lake Timea: A lake and its forested environs which rests towards the northern reaches of Stel Columnar territory. Rumored to be haunted, hexed, or otherwise unholy. //Things\\\\ AdArm Pack-model AutoHollow: A 20 foot tall, humanoid mech with broad shoulders, fully-articulating hands, and the headshape of a jackal. Designed for flexibility, the Pack can easily change its gear between missions, though it is most often seen wielding an anti-armor rifle. The Pack was designed to offer infantry-scale squads a little extra power or to supplement hollow squads with something maneuverable, reliable, and automated. They're also exceptional bodyguard units, for those who can afford their upkeep. //Additional Notes\\\\ The Nobel Fable of the First Wolves: In earlier days, when things were simple, The Nobel would say \"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\" And this was true when the Nobel were just the Nobel; but we determined that it was not enough for just The Nobel to be The Nobel, and the World to be the World. The Nobel needed the World; and the World needed the Lord. So our flock roamed, and it grew, but yet we also found ourselves threatened by wolves. And in our short-sightenedness, we assumed the Lord would protect us—and when we suffered losses, we assumed the Lord was telling us to protect ourselves, and we warred with the wolves. But then the Lord spoke to the Nobel, and the Lord said \"Did you not say that the world needed the Lord? Do you not see, that as I shepherd the Nobel, I too may shepherd the wolves?\" And so the Nobel lowered our arms and we learned of the wolves—how they hunted not for sport, but for sustenance; how they had their pack, as we had a flock. And then the wolves became one with the Nobel under the Lord, and we grew; oh, we grew, we grew in a way that we could have never imagined, and we learned one of the most important truths that we still hold dear—only the Lord can see the true path for the Nobel. In this mask, I wear this lesson. It is a reminder of God's wisdom, God's grace, and God's potential not just for the Nobel, but for all the World. The Nobel are far from faultless; in our weakest moments, we assume we are greater than the World. We assume we know best, and that the wolves of the World must crook their knee to us and the Lord to receive the Lord's gifts. But no. The Nobel are not sheep, to be held above all others, to graze passively in the Lord's field under God's watchful eye and protected by God's fences; we are merely the first wolves that the Lord deigned to be the Lord's pack. And as we are also wolves, our strength lies in growing our pack.

      "description": "Northwest of the seaside town of Obelle, there is a crater. Inside of that crater are the remains of the Divine Past, and those who wish to claim them: On one side, there are the members of the nascent special operations group the Rapid Evening. On the other, GLORY, a special Apostolosian unit which seeks to resurrect the culture's greatest heroes as supersoldiers. But as everyone on the holy moon of Partizan knows, there are always more than two sides. This week on PARTIZAN: SHORESIDE RECOVERY - BLACKGLOVES ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ GLORY: With the help of advanced Columnar cloning science, the Glory Project (or simply GLORY), claims to have resurrected (and made immortal) heroes of the nation's past called Eidolons. On Partizan, they field Kleos, Cassander, Vervain, and the squad's leader: Apothesa, original Eidolon of construction, military action, and history. Interested in Past's records chiefly because it might allow them to \"better recreate Apostolosian eidolons.\" The Zenith Fund: A public institution of Stel Columnar that incubates, defends, and offers testing for teams pursuing cutting edge projects in a wide range of fields including medicine, environmental science, infrastructure, culture, and emerging military hardware. Aids with major projects across every other Stel, including Apostolos' Glory Project. Horizon: In the popular consciousness, Horizon is a radical, anti-Principality terrorist organization. In actuality, they are a radical-reformist group, which seeks to drive out what it perceives as corruption in an empire that ought be pursuing noble (instead of selfish) ends. Rumored to be funded by Stel Kesh's House Brightline. //People\\\\ Dr. Cardiff Reach (he/him): Columnar researcher from the Zenith Fund who has been assigned to Apostolos' GLORY project. Quad legged, with four spindly metal legs. Wears a lab coat, independently-moving telescoping eyes, etc. \"Saint Dawn\" (she/her): Commander of Horizon's forces on all of Partizan. The pseudonym of Gucci Garantine, who hides her identity with metallic, golden face paint forming a \"major sector\" geometrical pattern on her face, covering her eyes, forehead, and cheeks. Figure A (they/them): A synthetic being that once worked inside of the Divine Past, working to make the data the Divine had available to it more understandable by other people. Kleos (they/them): Soldier of GLORY. Genetic clone of the Apostolosian hero and eidolon of the same name. Skin is an iridescent maroon color. Wears a bright red cloak wrapped around their neck and hanging back like a cape, totally topless otherwise, revealing firm, muscular torso. Khaki fatigue-capris. A spear slung over their back, and a heavy sidearm at their waist. //Places\\\\ Barranca: To the north of Obelle lies the Apostolosian province of Barranca, where mediterranian subtropical shores give way to a vast latticework of ravines and crags. There, military bases and civilian settlements sit in the crooks and alcoves, shaded by high canyon walls. Rising above it all is the famed Barranca Loop, a massive suspended cable system that runs up above the atmosphere like a giant bridge, and which allows Apostolos to launch ships and cargo into space. Heavily patrolled and under complete control of Stel Apostolos. //Things\\\\ Transgress Oblige : The hollow of Gucci Garantine, and a chief symbol of the terrorist organization Horizon. Whitesmoke color body, with the torso, shoulders, and upper arms covered in a sort of secondary armor layer that is blue with gold flourishes. Carries a bazooka and a pair of beam partizan (with a golden beam blade) which can retract into a beam saber. Below the blue armor layer is a secondary core, made of some sort of rare crystal: When revealed, those that see it are struck by the power and magnificence of humanity itself. Panther: Clementine's hollow, an ancient mech piloted by a near mythological hero of a war barely remembered. Medium sized, black, humanoid, angular, and birdlike in some elements of its design. In another life, it could split itself up into independently flying microwings, each of which could serve as a flanking weapon. Its current pilot can not conceive of using it in this way. Stray Dog : Million's hollow, a Zenith-A Project Katalepsis prototype model, stolen when she went AWOL from GLORY. Medium-sized and humanoid in base shape, but able to rearrange its body to accommodate the rail gun built into the torso and left arm. Each limb is double jointed with sleek black and silver plating. There is only one glowing eye on the head, which houses the Stray Dog's aiming systems and pilot. Heads Up : Exeter Leap's hollow, a re-fitted Emergentec Rapid Response Type III Breaching Ambulance which he has converted for criminal purposes. Large cylindrical legs taper upwards towards the head. Armored fists and a back mounted mortar. Epoché : The prototype hollow of Kleos, leader of GLORY, developed by the Columnar's Zenith Fund. Deep brown, triangular head, humanoid machine with gold accents, and a faceplate made of brown stone, and heavy skirt plates to defend its upper legs/lower torso. A long, oval shield built onto it's left arm, a pair of grappling hook launches on its skirt waste. Wields a guisarme—a spear that has a hook on the reverse side of the blade.

      "description": "The destruction of a Divine, the killing of an Elect, and war on a new front: Any one of these could shift the balance of power on a moon like Partizan. So when all three occurred in Obelle, the great Stels began to analyze, strategize, and maneuver immediately. Squadrons were re-deployed, diplomats recalled, artists commissioned, and clergy and commentariat both called to weigh in. But for Stel Kesh, one matter was more important than any other: The safe and honorable recovery of the body of their lost Elect and the retrieval of enough of their ruined Divine so that they may begin the arduous process of revitalization, a task which required a great deal of knowledge, even more salvaged material, and the gumption to put the two together. To this end, the newly minted—and still clandestine—Rapid Evening are deployed across the sea, under the orders of erstwhile heiress and novice commander Clementine Kesh (Jack de Quidt). Can Clementine, along with former pirate Exeter Leap (Ketih J. Carberry), religious advisor Sovereign Immunity (Art Tebbel), and AWOL super soldier Ver'Million Blue (Andi Clare), secure acceptable terms with one of her Stel's most ardent foes? Or will negotiations break down under the weight of old enmity and new blood? This week on PARTIZAN: SHORESIDE RECOVERY - DINNERDATE ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Rapid Evening: A small, covert ops squad loyal to Stel Kesh and named for a now ancient unit of spies, saboteurs, and secret agents. The Curtain: Allegedly, the Curtain is the cryptocratic organization that pulls the levers of power in Stel Kesh. In reality ████████████. Silversky Salvage and Repair: Salvagers are a dime a dozen, but with chief engineer Sombre Sky in the pit, no one on Partizan is better at putting a machine back together. Dispatched to Obelle along with the Rapid Evening to ensure that the most important parts of Past are retrieved. //People\\\\ Clementine Kesh (she/her) : Formerly sixth in line to the throne of Stel Kesh and the Principality writ large. Was assigned to \"religious leave\" in order to remove her from the line of succession and place her in comparative safety on the moon of Partizan. Now leads the Rapid Evening out of ambition and boredom. Dreams of ruling Stel Kesh. Sovereign Immunity (he/him) : Member of the Shepherd's Crook, a sect of Received Asterism famous for placing high ranking members in advisory roles across many Stels (despite the sect's loyalty to Stel Nideo). Imprisoned for the crime of kidnapping of Dahlia years before they would declare themself the Glorious Princept, then reassigned to the Rapid Evening. He is also known as the Farmer and Byron. Dreams of being assigned to Clementine as her official Sovereign Immunity. Exeter Leap (he/him): A space pirate and one of the few remaining members of the Equiaxed culture in Stel Columnar space. Imprisoned for the aforementioned piracy before being assigned to the Rapid Evening. Dreams of escaping imprisonment. Ver'Million Blue (she/her): Created as part of an Apostolosian super soldier program, Million is an excellent sharpshooter who went AWOL (violently) and was eventually picked up as a POW by Stel Kesh. Recently deployed to Partizan as part of the Rapid Evening. Dreams of real freedom. Crysanth Kesh (she/her) : Clementine Kesh's mother. Third in line to the throne of Kesh. Would likely be a ranking member of The Curtain, if such an organization existed. Audacious Opportunity (A.O.) Rooke (he/him) : Was a young freelance mercenary operating under Stel Orion charter before being captured by Stel Kesh on an assignment deep behind enemy lines. Now deployed to the Rapid Evening. Gucci Garantine (she/her) : Vassal and political attache to House Brightline of Stel Kesh. She and House Brightline reportedly have ties to the \"reformist\" (read: terrorist) organization HORIZON. Rivals with Clementine Kesh. Sombre Sky (she/her) : Chief engineer at Silversky Recovery and Restoration, she stays out of politics except for when politicians bring her new gear to play with. Calendar Longyear (they/them) : A young ship captain who has inherited their grandmother's vessel, the final asset of their house's once affluent estate. Eager to make something of themself, they just don't know what. Cas'alear Rizah (cas/cas', they/them) : Leader of the Swordbreakers an elite Apostolosian Hallow unit. See entry in Dossier 01 for more details. //Places\\\\ The Verglaz Taiga: Wrapped around the northern latitudes of Partizan, the Verglaz is a beauty to take in, at least from the comfort of the palatial Kesh estates which dot its wooded expanses. From the smaller villages and towns, where feudal tenants huddle for warmth in the snow, whatever aesthetic pleasure the taiga may offer the rich is lost. In the south west, though, a new source of warmth has made its presence known: The burning engine of the Apostolosian war machine, which melts the ice away with artillery barrage and crashed mech, both. Cruciat: The Jewel of Kesh's holdings on Partizan (and the home of the Stel's Winter Palace) sits on a cross shaped island in the northernmost reaches of the Prophet's Sea The Winter Palace : Owned and managed by House Kesh, but eternal \"home\" to the Princept, whether they choose to visit or not. Built for privacy and access, featuring both its own port and trainyard. Westhaven : Kesh's military might is most centered in this province, which stretches across its westmost ports and up against its border with chief rival, Apostolos. \"Westhaven stands so that we may serve dinner in the palace.\" The Estatelands : The southeastern taiga, where the climate is most temperate and the tall trees stand closely together, is home to the dozens of noble families who rule Kesh's lands on Partizan. Miles of canopy suddenly broken by vast, cleared and pruned acreage. //Things\\\\ \"The Old Treaties\" : A collection of documents referring to now-ancient law that ensures the safe recovery and return of the bodies of Elects and Divines wounded in any civil conflicts across Divinity. Divines and Elects are both honored and respected assets to the state, and these treaties represent the mutually understood belief that the Principality will outlive whatever conflict is occurring. //Additional Notes\\\\ The Rapid Evening's Mission Objectives : Primary: Ensure that Silversky Recovery and Restoration can retrieve key parts of the body of Past, as well as the body of Cymbidium, Past's elect. Secondary: Produce actionable intel about who killed Cymbidium. Additionally: Recover anything they've already stolen from Past. Rules of Engagement : The deployment of chemical, biological, explosive, and/or poisonous weapons is forbidden. Additionally, kill or capture anyone who has accessed the Divine Past's memory.

      "description": "To the west of the small town of Obelle, the Oxblood Clan attempts to secure the landing zone for an inbound VIP. The plan is simple: Recover them and escape east across the sea. To aid them in that task, the Society of Banners and Bright Returns have been sent to take out the nearby Apostolosian militia's sensors, fuel reserves, and weapon platforms. So far, it's been light work for the team, with Kal'mera Broun's artillery-scale flashbang and Thisbe's powerful mechanical gorilla, Mow, being key to a smash-and-grab that's given the team control over the enemy's hollows. But now, as Valence is confronted by a member of an Apostolosian smuggling ring, chaos begins to seep into the mission... This week on PARTIZAN: Obelle, On Fire ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Red Fennecs: Technically, the Red Fennecs are an Apostolosian logistics and transport squad. In actuality, they're utilized by their commanding officer, Tes'ili Serikos, as the backbone of a humble smuggling operation. The Partizan Palace: Across Divinity, the Palace provides citizens with authorized archival information, approved news reports (kept up to date locally by the day, galactically by the week), and art and entertainment determined to be canonical to the Divine Principality. House Whitestar : For generations, House Whitestar was among the smallest vassal families of Stel Kesh's most powerful noble House (itself called House Kesh). With modest holdings and minimal political influence, it seemed they'd inevitably fade into history. But after the Apostolosian leader Dahlia declared themselves the Glorious Princept, Stel Kesh announced that Cynosure Whitestar-Kesh, a mid-level diplomat, was the true Princept. With his rise, they've grown in importance and power. //People\\\\ Tes'ili Serikos (they/them, tes/tes') : This Apostolosian transport specialist, black marketeer, and Tes'ili Serikos can get just about anything just about anywhere, for a price. Short, round, fuzzy, and good natured… unless you screw tes over. Cymbidium (he/him): The elect of the Kesh-aligned divine Past. Cymbdium is an Ashen, the descendent culture of the ancient deer-like Hypha people. He is traveling to Partizan for mysterious reasons. Azyet Eyesgrene (she/her): Recorder for the Partizan Palace. (Name unspoken.) //Places\\\\ The Prophet's Path: An autonomous region of Partizan running from east from the barren edge of the desert, through the tropical coast, and through the Isles of Logos. Independent towns and cities like Obelle make up the bulk of its continental settlements. Believed to be the area through which the prophet Logos Kantel traveled on their miraculous journey one thousand years ago. //Things\\\\ The Divine Past: Part floating city, part living library. The Divine Past was built tens of thousands of years before the Divine Principality was created. It stores an untold amount of information about the cultures it has observed, including the Divine Principality itself. The only person who can access this information is its Elect, who wanders its endless halls and travels across Divinity as equal parts librarian, priest, ship captain, and diplomat. Cast: A mirror-coated, humanoid mech that appears like a four-winged angel, with loud jet engines hidden inside of its shiny, metallic wings. Just above its mouth, its head becomes an AWACS-esque flat sensor disc. Largely built for reconnaissance, and deployed by the Palace to gather information and recordings. Avoids conflict, though can defends or stabilize itself with a system of chains and hooks. Ataraxia: A white, purple, and yellow mantid-shaped machine blessed by the divine Commitment and developed by Stel Columnar's Zenith Fund. Each of its six curved limbs can light up its edges with energy beams. On the ground, it can dance in combat in such a way that any two limbs can be its temporary feet, and when it's in flight, it becomes a complete whirlwind of violence. Named for the philosophical concept key to ancient Stoicism. Herd: Developed from the basic AdArm Troop design, the Herd's centaur like silhouette is famous to anyone who has faced off against Apostolos. The Troop's bipedal legs have been replaced with piston-driven, heavy quad legs that are able to shift between two modes: Movement (with legs paired parallel like an ungulate, allowing for high speed traversal or charges) or combat (spread in a wide cross shape for stability in firing or traversal, moving like a spider). Armed with heavy shoulder cannon, and spears that can be used for both melee combat and as javelin-like explosive projectiles. (Name unspoken.) Yoke: The Oxblood Clan's unique, further customized Herds. Though they cannot transform into the Herd's \"combat\" mode, they have upgrades that allow them to serve a unique command and operations role when deployed in pairs. Their heads feature unique horn sensors which can generate battlefield map data and targeting assistance when two Yokes can provide complete data. Wields a giant fortress shield in left hand, a kanabo in the right, and a vertical missile pod on back. (Name unspoken.) //Additional Notes\\\\ SBBR's Mission Objectives : Primary: Support Oxblood's mission by destroying the Apostolosian fuel depot at point Barnacle and sensor station at point Carp, each outside of Obelle proper. Secondary: Destroy any hallows or hollows at Point Dory, in the Apostolosian base west of the river in Obelle. Rules of Engagement : No harming civilians or civilian property inside of Obelle--destruction of fields is incidental and acceptable collateral damage. Do not enter Point Albacore under any circumstances.

      "description": "It started with as basic a job as they come: The Society of Banners and Bright Returns (SBBR), a rookie outfit based in Oxbridge, was tapped for a contract as a support unit in a rescue op. There was a little town called Obelle on the border between the Apostolosian Barranca and the Prophet's Path, where damn near the only free folks in the Principality made their home. Some sort of VIP was making landfall just northwest of the spot, and while another crew was doing the pickup, SBBR (which was just the engineer Kal'mera Braun, the alien empath Valence, and that big goddamn robot, Thisbe at the time) had to tilt the scales in favor of a smooth getaway. Drop in, knock out a sensor dish, blow up some reserve fuel, and (if they were feeling especially confident) incap a couple of Troops before they could get up and moving. But SBBR wouldn't be SBBR if they didn't find a way to do a milk run in reverse... This week on PARTIZAN: The Seaside Town of Obelle ///Operation Dossier\\\\\\ //Organizations\\\\ The Society of Banners and Bright Returns (SBBR): A daring mercenary outfit that takes on reconnaissance, espionage, sabotage, and theft missions. Independent, but operating under Stel Orion and the Scrivener's Guild. Scrivener's Guild : An organization of (armed) clerks who mediate negotiations, draft contracts, and keep records of all industrial, commercial, and private business operations with Orion-aligned organizations. Unhappy with SBBR's performance. The Oxblood Clan : What started as a group of orphans turned into a labor guild and criminal enterprise with connections across Partizan. Occasionally run rough-and-tumble military ops for extra cash. Allies with SBBR. The Swordbreakers : An Apostolosian squad blessed by the divine Commitment and led by Cas'alear Rizah, the adopted sibling of the Apokine and Princept Dahlia. They're known across the war as legend killers who punch above their weight. //People\\\\ Kal'Mera Broun (they/them, played by Alicia Acampora): SBBR's in-house technician with a focus in designing and deploying specialized artillery. Apostolosian born, Orion trained. Valence (they/them, played by Andrew Lee Swan): An empath from a culture beyond the Partizan gate, searching for allies for their culture, the Nobel. Serves as \"face\" for SBBR. Thisbe (she/her, played by Janine Hawkins): A large, humanoid labor robot whose design is based on the ancient Hypha people. Recently unearthed by farmers, and then traded between mercenary units until she wound up in SBBR's control. Kueen Overture Rooke (she/her): SBBR's contact at the Scrivener's Guild. A former ace pilot, lead mechanic, and battlefield commander, KO now uses her expertise to dispatch and guide mercenary units across Partizan. Anchor Afton (she/her): Commander of the Oxblood Clan unit deployed in Obelle. Upper middle age. Silver hair, weathered complexion. Dark eyes. Muscular as shit. Third generation Ox. Jesset City (he/him): On mission as support unit & on-site repairs for Oxblood. Young and eager to make friends. Doesn't know much about this mission. Pilots a Cloud unit, a \"re-appropriated\" Apostolosian recon model. Cas'alear Rizah (cas/cas', they/them): Leader of the Swordbreakers. Cas has brown skin with dark green hair up in a bun, with a few strands hanging down in front of their face (which is framed with similarly colored scales covering cas' jawline and neck. Broken sword tattoos under their eyes. Reputation as being beautiful and brave by allies, unflinching and unpredictable by foes. Pilots the notorious Hallow, Ataraxia. //Places\\\\ Obelle : A small, seaside town between Apostolos territory to the north and the independent lands of the Prophet's Path to the south. Sleepy agricultural town with tiny small tourist industry, as its often used as a resstop for those walking their pilgrimage down the Prophet's Path. Because it is far from Apostolos' northern border with Kesh, their military holdings here are diminished. //Things\\\\ Hallow/Hollow : The (often, but not always humanoid) mechs that serve as the backbone of Divine Principality military units. \"Hallows\" have received the direct, personal blessing of a Divine (and whatever benefits, material, social, or spiritual that come with that). \"Hollows\" have not. Both serve their purpose. Three Cheers! : Kal'mera Broun's hollow, a heavily modified Adamant Arms and Artifice (aka AdArm) machine. Humanoid with the ability to take a mobility form. Equipped for long range volleying. Easily removable/replaceable plates with non-standard rivets. Hippocampus : Valence's hollow, an AdArm Prototype Loveliness. A small, ovoid cockpit that has two \"chicken legs\" attached to it. Helicopter blades fold out from inside the cockpit and onto the top of the mech to give it basic flight. Mow : A recovered Zenith-A Project Eudaimonia prototype model. The build of a gorilla, quadrupedal & topheavy, a saddle horn-like addition on the back, battered but lovingly maintained. AdArm Troop : Designed by The de facto \"grunt\" mech of the Divine Principality. 55~ feet tall bipedal hollow, mid sized but bulky in aesthetic. Blocky, visible cabling. Head is a rectangular unit (with a long, flat LED-lit single \"eye\") that functions as a sensor suite, and attached to its right (above the shoulder) is a heavy cannon. Left arm has actuator/clasper, right has bayonet. Zenith-A Cloud : A small (35 feet, standing) transforming Apostolosian recon and support hollow. Two large, rear jointed legs allow it to leap high into the air and enter flight mode, keeping it safe from harms way and providing additional visuals. Torso has four arms, two of which have high-precision tools for repairs. Remaining two have light weaponry, incl. Anti-infantry machinegun and smoke grenades. //Additional notes\\\\ SBBR's Mission Objectives : Primary: Support Oxblood's mission by destroying the Apostolosian fuel depot at point Barnacle and sensor station at point Carp, each outside of Obelle proper. Secondary: Destroy any hallows or hollows at Point Dory, in the Apostolosian base west of the river in Obelle.

      "description": "It is the year 1423 of the Perfect Millennium, and the galaxy has been conquered by the Divine Principality. At the center of this empire, the only place where its five Great Stels meet, there is a moon beating where a heart should be. The moon of Partizan. Abetted by immortal, machinic gods called Divines, and the legions of Hallowed mechs which extend their terrible reach, the Principality spent millennia sharpening itself on its rivals. What it could not devour it obliterated. What it could not obliterate, it simply outlived. It was an empire, unshakeable. Until now. For the first time in the Principality's long history, two of its five Stels have gone to war with one another, each guided by a ruler with sound claim to the title of Princept, leader of All Divinity. For five years, they have fought to a standstill, while equivacators and scavengers find profit in rubble. But historical crises do not only serve crass opportunists, they revive opportunity itself. Under the shadow of this war you find yourself wondering: For how long will there be empires? For as long as we breathe? Longer? Will the categories of our conquest outlast us, or could there come a day for something else. We once dreamt that breaking free from our ancient home in the cosmos would allow us to escape the mass and pull of tyranny and trauma. We failed then, but perennial chaos offers us another chance: Can we launch with such speed that we glide, graceful or imperfect, beyond war and pain? Or is the truth more damning that: Might we carry our own gravity with us? This week on PARTIZAN: The Divine Principality Welcome to the latest season of Friends at the Table: PARTIZAN . We'll be playing Beam Saber by Austin Ramsay, \"a Forged In The Dark game about the pilots of powerful machines in a war that dominates every facet of life.\" Though this season takes place in the same universe COUNTER/Weight and Twilight Mirage , neither of those seasons is required listening for this new season, so if you've been curious about our show, this is totally a great place to hop on board. If today's episode all about world building and character creation is a little too slow for you, don't be afraid to hop back on for next week's episode, which will be action packed and full of great character moments. If you like what you've heard this episode, then please consider going to our Patreon , which is FILLED with bonus content. We've got a Patreon-only campaign called Bluff City, bonus live streams, a tips show, \"Clapcasts\" featuring some of the unrelated pre-show chatter, and even a special show called Drawing Maps where I talk through my prep and worldbuilding. To give you a little taste, we've made the first two episodes of Bluff City, a brand new Clapcast , and the first of the PARTIZAN Drawing Maps episodes free to everyone! Finally: Every episode this season is going to come with a little Dossier in the episode description. Think of this as a mix between a play's Dramatis Personae listing and a cheat sheet. It'll be a (pseudo-diegetic) list of important characters, organizations, places, vehicles, items, and concepts that come up for the first time (or for the first time in a long time) in the episode. For today's entry (which is non-diegetic) I've included the list of factions, religions, and major events that I sent to the players during the character creation process. Find this below, along with a maps of both the Divine Principality's view of the galaxy and of Partizan itself, both of which were done by the incredible Annie Johnston-Glick ( @dancynrew on Twitter, commission her!) Thanks ALSO to to Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot on Twitter, commission him!) for another season of incredible art. You can also find the music from this and all of our seasons over on Jack's bandcamp . Thank you all for your support throughout 2019 and into the new year. This year, we wrapped up Hieron, started a new experiment with the Road to PARTIZAN, and are now picking up with our first \"new\" characters and setting in two years. We couldn't have done any of that without your support, and without your help in spreading the word about the show to others. So as a final appeal: If you like this episode, consider telling your friends about us! Thanks again, and happy holidays. Austin Walker GM & Co-Founder ------------------- The Divine Principality is a massive space empire led by a Princept and comprised of five major houses, called Stels. While the Principality is in a state of constant war with The Branched , a rival power extremely far from the small moon of Partizan, these Stels are also in various states of conflict (open and hidden) with each other. In brief, those Stels are: Stel Kesh: The oldest established power in the galaxy, built around a stuffy (and secretive) aristocracy. They are tied to the Past. History, knowledge, stubbornness. Stel Nideo: Created the largest faith in the empire, and used that influence to shape (and surveil) mass culture. They are tied to the Present. Faith, coercion, stability. Stel Orion: An industrial giant that controls more literal space than any other Stel, yet is also the most fragmented and unstable. They are tied to Space . Wealth, labor, expansion. Stel Columnar: A fence-sitting democracy, made up largely of synthetics on the cutting edge of technology, art, politics, and war. They are tied to the Future. Innovation, style, cowardice. Stel Apostolos: A dynamic and diverse military powerhouse, guided by an iconic, but controversial leader. They are tied to Motion . Speed, change, violence. There are two major faiths in the Principality. Both espouse the idea of an empire built of minor states--allowing for small scale conflict without threat to the whole empire. Where they differ is: Received Asterism: Teaches that Divines, the immortal machines and mechs that helped establish the Principality's hold on the galaxy, reflect the best aspects of the state itself. The divine Strength, in other words, is like a living flag of the Principality's own strength. Progressive Asterism: Teaches that these same Divines are true embodiments of their names, and that the citizens and states of the Principality should look to them as guiding stars. The Divine Strength, in other words, is a reflection of strength itself, or maybe \"god's strength,\" and we should aspire to make our strength look like the divine's. 5 years ago, Dahlia, the living Princept (born to Kesh, then kidnapped by Nideo, then rescued and raised into adulthood by Apostolos), declared themself leader of both Stel Kesh and Apostolos alongside a stunning revelation of the Principality's crimes against Apostolos. Kesh called these claims an Apostolosian ploy for power, and elected a minor noble as an anti-Princept. Today, as Apostolos and Kesh war openly over territory, authority, and public sentiment, the other Stels seek to capitalize on the chaos. Columnar and Orion's long cold war, driven by each Stel's desire to cement its status as dominant economic and technological power, needs only a single spark to explode. Still repairing their reputation after the Farmer's Sin, Stel Nideo bides their time, rebuilds their forces, and gains popular support. Soon, a weakness will be revealed, and they will be prepared.

      "description": "Welcome to the final part of the final game (but not the final episode) of the Road to PARTIZAN. Building on the foundation of everything that has come before, this week Andi, Austin, Dre, and Keith fill in more important gaps in the history of the Divine Principality. A fourth and fifth Stel rise. Ploys, plots, and backstabbings abound. A centuries-long war begins in earnest. And final, a fracture forms at the heart of Divinity. As mentioned above, this will not be the last update on the Road to PARTIZAN. Next week, Dre, Jack, and Austin will walk through the entire Microscope timeline, offering a recap of history from the end of Twilight Mirage to the beginning of PARTIZAN. Whether you're just jumping in or need a refresher, we hope that'll be useful to you. And one week after that , we'll be launching PARTIZAN in earnest with episode 00, where you'll be introduced to the player characters, squads, and starting situation. As a reminder, if you want more info on the world of PARTIZAN, check out our Patreon at FriendsAtTheTable.cash , where Austin has shown of tons of additional worldbuilding, including faction, region, NPC squad, and Mech creation!

      "description": "Finally, the Road to PARTIZAN enters its final lap. Over the next two weeks, we'll be zooming the camera out to look at the 5,000+ years that have taken us from the end of the Twilight Mirage to the very moment PARTIZAN begins, and to do that we'll turn to Ben Robbins' excellent Microscope , a game which we used in part during COUNTER/Weight's \"faction turns.\" In this first part, we'll look directly at the moon world of Partizan, where a religious prophet makes a dramatic claim, performs apparent miracles, and winds up caught in the machinations of an empire. Will this shake the religious foundations of the Principality? Or will this prophet be stomped out like so many other challenges to Divinity's rule… This Week on the Road to PARTIZAN: Microscope Pt. 1 ///YEAR:1418 PERFECT MILLENNIUM ////LOCATION: PARTIZAN | ASHEN STRAND 001.01 | ISLES OF LOGOS ///RECORD TYPE: AUDIOVISUAL This is a low-quality recording of a \"Rededication Ceremony\" at a temple or church. Across two dozens sequences, the footage follows members of this community as they prepare for, attend, and mingle after a religious ceremony. The footage leaps from scene to scene artlessly, offering only brief snatches of time as the camera operator inconsistently holds down the \"record\" button. Banners are hung. Seating is assigned. An orator speaks at a podium in front of a large, dark shape. They are in the middle of speaking, and the camera picks up the words \"their war is our opportunity,\" before being cut off. Afterwards, food and drink is provided. Over the sound of backround chatter, an attendee offers the camera a friendly hand sign and a smile.

      "description": "The Road to PARTIZAN continues, and it does so with Alex Roberts' and Evil Hat Productions' For the Queen , a card based storytelling game about the retinue of a leader on a critical journey through difficult territory. Today's game takes place about 500 years before the events of Partizan, at a moment where the Principality marches against two of the only remaining galactic powers not yet under the heel of the Divine Principality, each an echo of a past culture that fans of our second season, COUNTER/Weight, will know well. Now those two cultures join on this crucial mission to the heart of Divinity. From the Empire of Apostolos, the Apokine (our stand in for the game's titular Queen) has gathered around them a cadre of trusted companions: Eudora (Andrew Lee Swan), their adopted sibling, Antigone Gennadiy (Janine Hawkins), their former caretaker and a current soldier in their military, and Orbit Shard (Andi Clare), their bodyguard and most trusted fighter. They are joined by Modus Maria (Austin Walker) a member of the mysterious \"Branched,\" a people who have transformed their bodies into something spectacular and free—only to have the threat of war force them to rebuild themselves as soldiers first and foremost. In this moment, the future is unwritten. Can the Apokine finish their journey and secure freedom for their people? Or will Apostolos be conquered by the Principality, as so many other people and places have been?

Brief description of Fort Icebreaker: \"a mobile fortress,\" \"network of tunnels,\" \"treads and cannons\" Neutral analysts from Orion and Columnar are quoted, citing the divine Motion's ability to extend operation time of Apostolosian hollows as a key aspect of this victory, though secondary to Hyacinth's strategy Melody Sefton East of the Church of Received Asterism calls for an end to hostilities.

But whatever secrets are held on its surface are locked behind a gate, a gate patrolled by the Divine Courage, defended by orbital cannons, and barricaded behind the constant gunfire and flame of a raging battle. Somehow, a squad comprised of superstar mechathlete Memphis Longhand, the brothers David and Smack Talk, and the Candidate Pigeon must breach this perimeter. And they have to do it while carrying a very big box. Today on The Road to PARTIZAN: Beam Saber Pt. 2 ////ASSET: FORMERLY HABITABLE WORLD, 'GRONA' ////LOCATION: Lagoon-N 1232 ///STATUS: ABANDONED | EXPENDED ///DESCRIPTION: From its initial colonization in the Miraculous Millennium, through its time as battlefield in the Victorious Millennium, and until the final days of the Perfect Millennium's first century, Grona was Class IV planet under the Lammer classification system. However, once hostilities settled after ██████████████████████████████████, Yes! Power, Better Brighter, and other firms were able to more fully utilize the planet's resource basin. With Orion's extractive mechanisms working at full capacity, Grona was elevated for two centuries from habitable world into a more a more comprehensive portfolio of bundled resources.

      "description": "On today's entry of the Road to PARTIZAN, we pick up with the characters we made in Dusk to Midnight and zoom in to the climax of the Divine Clash by playing Beam Saber by Austin Ramsay . Months ago, the OriCom Logistics Division staged a strategic coup against the Divine Principality by successfully escorting Courageous to a rendezvous point where they opened a gate for OriCom's ally in the war, the Divine Collaborate, so that they could join OriCom's fleet with their own. In the time since, though, the fighting has been trying, the allies have lost many (including teammate Lunar Leson), and additional reinforcements are far away and moving more slowly than anticipated. Which is why Memphis Longhand, the Talk brothers, and their new Divine-piloting ally, Pigeon, are being sent on a secret mission. On the planet of Grona, in the city of Zibeline, fighting rages against the occupying Principality's forces. The resistance there is waiting desperately for a delivery that is supposed to change the war forever... This week on the Road to PARTIZAN: Beam Saber Pt. 1 ////ASSET: Dunlop-class Mobile Shipping Depot, ' Topmark' ////LOCATION: Lagoon-N 332 ///STATUS: ABANDONED | DECOMMISSIONED ///DESCRIPTION: Dunlop-class Mobile Shipping Depots were mobile logistics platforms designed for refuel and repair in the era before Stel Orion's formation. Able to house six frigate-class vessels at once, the Dunlop was an operational cornerstone for both Orion warfare and commerce. Once integration into the Principality was complete, these depots fell out of favor for both aesthetic and technical reasons. This particular vessel was decommissioned after ████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████. No attempt should be made to recover.

      "description": "Welcome back to the Road to PARTIZAN. Today, we're moving into a new trio of episodes that explore an era of history that would come to be called The Divine Clash. For over a century, the ever-growing Divine Principality would throw its might against the allied forces of the Orion Combine and the Divine Collaborate, the distant successor states of two major nations featured in our COUNTER/Weight season. Next week and the week following, we'll see the climax of the Divine Clash via Austin Ramsay's Beam Saber . But first, we offer a pair of vignette one-shots via two games that were made for the Emotional Mecha Game Jam (which was organized by John R. Harness and Takuma Okada). First, in Role Over Play Dead's Ech0 , we travel through the wreckage the war left behind, as children born over a generation after the war's end try to reunite the memory core of a long dead pilot with her machine. Then, in Riley Rethal's Dusk to Midnight , we define the early days of the Clash, and follow the careers (and the wavering resolve) of four of the pilots who would help to decide its outcome. A couple of extra notes: First of, because one of the player's files was totally corrupted, much of this episode had to be rebuilt via a backup recording. That means that there are a few times where you can hear breathing sounds heavier than normal. There are also moments where background noise is a bit more prevalent, and it was pretty impossible to untangle some crosstalk (especially since we were playing as children especially prone to crosstalk in Ech0 ). You'll might also notice that I say a few times up top that we want to play three of these vignettes. Due to time concerns, we couldn't make that happen, but for the record, the final vignette I'd planned was EPITAPH by Dante Douglas, which is metal as hell and rules. You should check it out. Finally, because Ech0 is such a visual experience, I've included a screenshot of the map we drew below. You can find close ups of all of our sketches at the Mapmaker tier over on our Patreon (with a quick caveat that we're currently catching up on much of our Patreon stuff, and we've been prioritizing new shows up rather than supporting material, but it's coming soon, I promise!)

      "description": "Join us in our second game on the Road to PARTIZAN, where we are playing Armour Astir: Advent by Briar Sovereign , a fantastic PbtA mech game that is equal parts Escaflowne and Mobile Suit Gundam. Today's episode starts with about 20 minutes of setup explaining the game and introducing the characters. If you want to skip all of that, then read the next couple of paragraphs and jump ahead to 22:45 . Our game of Armour Astir takes place in a time of fables and magic, around 500-1000 years after our first Road to PARTIZAN game. As the Divine Principality spreads and grows in power, one small group inside of it tries to check its imperial ambition. That group is called Horizon, and it is funded and controlled by the powerful House Brightline of Stel Kesh, who are nostalgic for a better age--whether or not that age ever existed is, of course, up for debate. Horizon has heard word that Stel Nideo has located an incredible source of power at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, and is sending some sort of force to capture it. To stop Nideo, Horizon rushes ahead with a single ship to locate that device and to disable, destroy, or take it over for their own. The Ivory Prince, Horizon's ship, is blessed (and accompanied) by the mischievous divine Perennial, and captained by the noble Briar Brightline (Art Maritnez-Tebbel), an officer who loves it when a plan comes together. On board are three ace pilots: The Arcanist and Consul Cerise Sky (Andi Clare), a devotee of Perennial and high ranking magistrate in the Divine Principality. Teasel Mode (Janine Hawkins), an Ashen witch, who has bound herself tightly with Perennial in exchange for powerful gifts. And Vessel's Gold (Andrew Lee Swan), a cyborg mercenary from a culture left behind, who fights for a paycheck… and a good cause. As they land at the edge of a massive space station, can the crew come together to face down their foes and uncover the mysteries of the galactic core?

I worried at first, I admit. But then, I remembered my lessons. I remembered the Constellation of the Adversary: Three thousand years ago, a misguided and treasonous group attempted to sabotage everything we had built. But as time has shown, Divinity will not, can not, crumble so easily. Ours is a culture of equilibrium, a balanced society which--though it may shake--cannot fall. The Principality is a star shining so brightly, that no matter how many foes surround it, its light exceeds. It is for this reason that, even in this time of trouble, I am confident in Stel Nideo's future.\" Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Sylvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Edited by Austin Walker and Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "For millennia, three rules guided the Hypha as they traveled across the galaxy. First: Follow the light of the strand through the stars, stopping only on worlds marked by its color—and even then, only temporarily. Second: Never leave behind the bodies of our dead. And third: Protect at all costs the mystery of the Chorus Bond, that which connects us to each other, to the Strand, and perhaps to something even greater than that. But now, these rules—and the way of life they protect—have come under threat. The Divine Principality, a vast and hungry empire, has arrived. This week on Friends at the Table: The Road to Season 6: Dialect Pt. 2 ////YEAR: 850 MIRACULOUS MILLENNIUM ////LOCATION: PARTIZAN | ASHEN STRAND 001.01 | 33550336.8128.496 ///RECORD TYPE: AUDITORY The sound of an excavator's claw striking clay ground. Voices with Stel Kesh dialects discuss early findings at an archaeological site. [See Conversation 850MM.SK.ASHEN01]. Metal strikes metal, and the heft of something is raised from the ground. Near the microphone, there is the electronic beep of an incoming message, but none arrives. Then, from the distance but growing louder, the high pitched sound of resin shattering accompanied by human screams. Finally, the sound of a single pair hooves walking towards, and then past, the microphone, and the sound of the communications channel closing.

      "description": "Welcome to the Road to PARTIZAN, an interlude connecting Twilight Mirage to PARTIZAN, our next full season (where we'll be playing Beam Saber by Austin Ramsay) which will begin later this year! On that note, please know that though there is one spoiler for the way a couple of Twilight Mirage factions end up, there are no spoilers about major Twilight Mirage characters or their arcs anywhere throughout these episodes. The Road to Season 6 started with a desire to try out new game systems before we committed to one for a full season, but after thinking about it for a bit, we realized that we could use a bunch of games to explore the history of the massive, fracturing empire that will be at the center of PARTIZAN. And to do that right, we needed to make sure to start outside of that empire. To that end, we kicked things off with Dialect: A Game About Language and How It Dies by Kathryn Hymes and Hakan Seyalioglu. In this episode, we develop a new culture of nomadic space deer, and watch as they encounter an empire which aims to obliterate time and space themselves. As a quick follow up: This episode (and the rest of the Road to Season 6) all began as episodes in our Live at the Table series, a collection of one shot streams that we do for all $5+ Patrons! That means that you can go watch or listen to every episode of the Road right now if you head to our Patreon ! They won't have the intros (and they'll all be unedited, with a lot more dead air), but if you're desperate to know what comes next, you can learn that right now. If all this world building isn't your thing, and you'd rather skip these and rejoin us for the character driven drama and action of season six proper, then please know you can toatlly do that too. While these episodes will help fill in some blank spaces, they are not required listening for our next season! Either way, I hope you enjoy this series of episodes as much as we enjoyed making them. We'll see you in a couple of months, in the shadow of the giant Girandole, on the holy moon of Partizan... This week on Friends at the Table: The Road to Season 6: Dialect Pt. 1 ////YEAR: 174 ASCENDANT MILLENNIUM ////LOCATION: VALENCE 4 | HYPHAN STRAND 170.2 ///RECORD TYPE: VISUAL On a misted grassland running the length of the continental shelf, seventeen capital ships, 1223 rated vessels, and 340 personal vehicles are prepared for launch. A pilot boards a personal corvette, pausing to look at the sky above her. An aide whispers words of comfort to a pair in grief, then steps away to direct the transfer of remains and grave goods. The ghostlike projection of a heretical oracle flickers, antlers transparent yet reflecting the sun's light, and fades.

      "description": "Thank you for joining us to say goodbye to Hieron.... From beginning... ...to end!! It's been quite a journey and we had a great time capping it off by answering some of your questions! We had such a wonderful outpouring of support and love the past week and it really means the most to us! We love doing this and we love that people enjoy listening to it. Over the next weeks, the friends behind Friends at the Table are going to take a short break before starting our sixth season: PARTIZAN, a story of war, politics, faith, and (yes) giant mechs. You can hear the trailer in this episode or by itself, right here, and you can check out the game we'll be playing in PARTIZAN, Austin Ramsay's Beam Saber, right here. But before we get there, to keep your podcast feed warm, we'll be sharing the Road to Season Six, an anthology of one-shots played in different systems that will bridge the Twilight Mirage and PARTIZAN seasons. The Road to Season Six isn't necessary listening if you want to hop on board PARTIZAN in a couple of months, but it definitely provides some big picture context for the stakes and history that lead us to this new setting! These episodes originated as Live at the Table games, available to watch live for all of our Patreon supporters, and if you want to check them out (unedited, without music) right now , you can actually do that! Just go to friendsatthetable.cash and become a $5 supporter to get access to all of the Live at the Table games, our bonus campaign, Bluff City, and both Tips at the Table and Drawing Maps, two shows that share our thoughts on playing and prepping games. For just $1, you can get years of \"Clapcasts,\" collections of the all the chatter between us that happens before we get into the game proper. (Speaking of Live at the Table, most of the past Live at the Table music is NOW AVAILABLE over on Jack's bandcamp. Go check it out! ) If you're already a patron, or if you're not looking for more podcast to listen to but want to support the show somehow, then guess what: We have TWO new pieces of merchandise to check out. First, we've teamed up with Heart of the Deernicorn (creator of Fall of Magic and BFF!) and the incredible artist Simon Sweetman to make this Fall of Magic t-shirt, hoody, and print , featuring characters from our very own playthrough of that game! Second, we've opened up our own online store at friendsatthetable.shop , where you can (FINALLY!) buy prints of the incredible Hieron cover art by artist Craig Sheldon ! A single print is $15 USD, but you can get the entire set for just $35! A transcription is available for this episode here . A full list of completed transcriptions is available here. Our transcriptions are provided by a fan-organized paid transcription project. If you'd like to join, you can get more information at https://twitter.com/transcript_fatt .

      "description": "...took a new name: the Frost Shepherd. It was in trying to understand this act, its causes, and its consequences, that I first thought this second volume might be necessary. Even as it happened, I sensed a moment of diversion, of what an old mentor would have called a potential \"rupture\" in history. In the old Hieron, when such a thing was still possible, I studied and practiced as a semiotician of the New Archives. Because the Rhizome stretches as it does, and because we were so removed from the histories which precede us, you may not know what that means. In short: We collected the world so that we might better arrange it. This is how I fell in love with writing and with history. Towards the end of my studies, in some north campus basement, Semiotician Emeritus Uklan Tel delivered a guest lecture for a select group out of some technical obligation to the department. \"The world unfolds according to systems and rules,\" he told us. \"History, politics, war, society--they have velocity, they have force, they have momentum. But now and then there is a chance for great change.\" Any average evening would be followed by an equally average day, but a rupturous evening might bring a day like one we've never seen. But these moments only carried the potential for transformation, he told us. These moments of historical rupture, he said, offered opportunity for the systems and rules by which we organize ourselves to find a new route. But most of the time? That opportunity was wasted. Things returned to the status quo. The moons past over the edge of the world, the sun arose, and we'd be back to normal. I had the impression, as he started to speak, that he was trotting out an old lecture, something reliable, that even dead in his voice would impress on our young, eager psyches. But as he spoke, he found a startling rhythm, like an old workhorse building towards a colt's gait. It was as if something he'd seen, something recent, maybe, had given flesh to words that had only been bone. I could tell that he thought he wasn't just correct, but that he right . He told us, then, that we might not know it, but that we lived in a moment of rupture. And when I stood in that crowd and heard the Frost Shepherd speak, I recognized in my own blood, on my own skin, an echo of Tel's old confidence in recognizing a moment rupture. When Tel warned us about the future, he was, of course right--and only now do we know how ironic this warning was, considering his own role in the events of the years that followed that lecture. Which is excuse enough for me to extend his warning to you: In times like these, the rupture is not one night, it is ongoing, and we are all participants in whatever comes next. Pace yourselves. Recognize the way you touch the world. And travel accordingly. -An Excerpt from the Foreword to The Last Days The We Had: A Narrative Catalogue of Hieron, End Apparent, Pt. 2 by Alonzo Victor Devareaux van der Dawes This week on Spring in Hieron: The Second Spring Pt. 5 Hosted by Austin Walker (@austin_walker) Featuring Janine Hawkins (@bleatingheart) Sylvi Clare (@captaintrash), Ali Acampora (@ali_west), Art Martinez-Tebbel (@atebbel), Jack de Quidt (@notquitereal), Keith J Carberry (@keithjcarberry) and Andrew Lee Swan (@swandre3000) Music by Jack de Quidt (@notquitereal) Text by Austin Walker (@austin_walker) Produced by Ali Acampora (@ali_west) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon (@shoddyrobot) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "...understandably caused us to doubt not only our relationship with them (albeit too late), but also with ourselves and our faculties. The world was large, larger not only than what we'd known before but larger than anything it had been before. And it was large in new ways. In the old Hieron, a big place was wide or it was tall. But we'd learned that this place was deep . We'd regularly find new creatures and cultures in the branches we already knew well. How could we trust that we had not missed something important in a place like this? For the adventurous sort, those who followed in the footsteps of those who founded the modern University settlement, this was a plus. But for those whose task was to catalog, study, and explain the Rhizome, this was an ache that never dulled. \"It's made setting up our beat desks that much harder,\" said Marisol Sweetwater, then editor, now publisher of The New Current. \"We have to constantly ask ourselves questions that back in Rosemerrow would've been given. What does 'Local News' mean in a place where a whole civilization can just show up under some giant petal you never flipped over?\" The Rhizome was not simply vast, it was vasting , endlessly growing. And in the face of that, stability became the chief, communal referent. Even those who prefered the world this way, who were eager to turn leaves over for the rest of their lives, had their own exploits reframed in the popular rhetoric of cataloguing and mastery. One might take to the long branch to explore , but when their stories reached home, it was as proof that the Rhizome could be explored —routed, mapped, finally put to rest. Who knows why the discourse shifted like this. Some suggest it's because of a generic fear of the unknown. Maybe it was because it was what we already knew. Or, perhaps, it was because deep down we knew that there was only one way left for us to \"settle\" the world and make it knowable again, and we feared that possibility as much as we desired it. -An Excerpt from The Last Days The We Had: A Narrative Catalogue of Hieron, End Apparent, Pt. 2 by Alonzo Victor Devareaux van der Dawes This week on Spring in Hieron: The Second Spring Pt. 5 Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Sylvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Text by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "…unexpected means of conveyance, but at that time, what ought have been reasonably expected at all? Perhaps such flippancy isn't well placed. Now, with the benefit of distance and context, it's simple to recognize the many ways that the Rhizome should have shaken loose our assumptions along with all that old Hieronic dirt. But by all retrospective accounts--including this historian's own limited recollection--no single question dominated our collective anxiety as much as this one: What can we expect? In a world of giant insects, endless growth, unearthed histories older than the Weaver King was long, how could we know what tomorrow would bring? Perhaps it was phrased differently, sometimes more specifically or with more sentimentality. But at core, it was this question--this fear--that led many to swear allegiance to the banners of Alcyon, the University, the Grey Duke. The words delivered to us by the Shepherd confirm that it was what motivated those who came to that fateful Understanding. And while this is admittedly conjecture, it is easy to believe that it is what made so many pray to Galenica, whose most authorial power was still grounded in the one bit of old Hieron still left in grand supply: us. Would tomorrow be worse than today? Would the suns ever find consistency, the pollen ever break? Would those who left us return? Would the threads of the world spiral further apart than they already had? Would 'normalcy' ever arrive? In the face of these things, how common a response fear is. After all, what more could we expect? -An Excerpt from The Last Days The We Had: A Narrative Catalogue of Hieron, End Apparent, Pt. 2 by Alonzo Victor Devareaux van der Dawes This week on Spring in Hieron: The Second Spring Pt. 4 Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Sylvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "..alone would drive many settlements to resign themselves to his vassalage, as the Duke's medicinal stores separated him from many of the other warlords in that first year, when the pollen was so severe not only due to its density but to our own body's sluggish adaptation to it. But the University's leadership was not keen to submit to anyone, least of all a monarch who wouldn't even show his own face on the frontlines; whatever their differences, Corsica Neue and Lord Ephrim had in common a comfort with danger and a respect for those who would wade into it courageously. In hindsight, though, it has become clear that the Grey Duke's grand project—his attempt to re-order and organize the world around him and his territory—did not need others to kneel before him. They need only decide that facing him was a necessity to ensure his centrality in the new maps of the world. Which provides some context for the surprising, and not altogether unwelcome, tactics the Duke deployed... -An Excerpt from The Last Days The We Had: A Narrative Catalogue of Hieron, End Apparent, Pt. 2 by Alonzo Victor Devareaux van der Dawes This week on Spring in Hieron: The Second Spring Pt. 3 Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Sylvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "...good a start as could be imagined, given the circumstances. But there was a confounding question still, which seemed to rent space in everyone's mind: Yes, the university had survived, but where was it? This was not a philosophical question. It was a simple matter of fact, a concrete concern. \"Used to be three weeks, with cart, from Twinbrook,\" said one resident of the University, who operated a food cart both before and after the Second Spring. \"Sure, [I] haven't made that trip in eight or nine years, not with everything going on. But [I] could count on it. Three weeks, with cart.\" The man tapped his temple three times, as if to emphasize the truth of the matter. While early efforts--DuCarte's map school, the Spider Silk Gondola to Alcyon, Feritas' road project--were progressing on schedule, there was the gnawing feeling among some in leadership roles that these moved too slowly. \"If even our people, easy-tempered and well-calloused from the old life want to map this tangle out,\" wrote Corsica Neue in her journal, \"then others, those chronically conditioned by control and ease , must be even more eager mappers than we.\" -An Excerpt from The Last Days The We Had: A Narrative Catalogue of Hieron, End Apparent, Pt. 2 by Alonzo Victor Devareaux van der Dawes This week on Spring in Hieron: The Second Spring Pt. 2 Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Sylvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "…was standing there in the midst of utter chaos, I found strength in words uttered by the immortal warrior Red Jack (who you will become well acquainted with as you read on) only days before he led an assault on the being called the Advocate. \"Heroism,\" he said, \"is not such a unique thing.\" He was right. The heroes that day were not only those who faced down men worshipped as gods—or those that despised them. The heroes were the many whose names were not already known, who rallied their neighbors as the world around them crumbled, and ensured that even if the very body of Hieron itself vanished, Hieron, the collection of people, would not. The world, contrary to this book's title, did not end. All of which is to say that I am grateful that this text is being published in an incomplete state. The truth is that when I first began to write this volume, it wasn't a volume at all. It was just a book. An encyclopedia, collecting in one place stories from reliable (if not always honest) narrators, who together paint an image of the world as it was when it was still ending. As a writer and as an archivist, of course I knew a book like this could never be complete: Even if every fact I'd scribbled were true, even if I'd eradicated my bias—and I haven't—how could I be sure that some key detail was not lost in the telling? And so I am twice happy to be writing this foreword. First, because it means that the world and life (which frankly, I am very fond of) continues yet. Second, with our collective end seemingly deferred it gives me an excuse to begin a second volume, less focused on the apocalyptic end of everything, and more interested in all the minor endings we face as we find out what life even is here in the rhizome. For now, though, I hope that you find this volume insightful, and that if you do not, that you at least find it entertaining. A final note to that end: While you can read this text linearly from front to back, I advise simply opening to any page and reading the first full entry there, and following the references and footnotes there listed. If you absolutely must be given a defined starting place, though, I recommend entry A919: The Island of Eventide.

      "description": "Across the long lawns below the central tower of the Last University, the grass defies itself. In the mind, a field is a million individual blades blending into one. But when Stars of the steppe arrive, they make mental category into physical reality, each blade blending with the next until the trembling, green pasture becomes blinding, fixed tract. But even this transformation, which spreads across the whole of one of the continent's densest settlements, is minute against what occurs above. A distraught god once promised that he would do anything to hold back the Heat and the Dark. Now, he proves his intent, yet wonders to himself if he can be stopped; if, perhaps, eradication might be better. This week on Spring in Hieron: See Where You're Standing Taken all at once, the unearned length of my life, it is easy to call this unavoidable. After all, before I could hold a chalice, I could only drink with tooth and maw, my thirst unsated, as blood stained the ground. Before I could store unfinished thoughts on a shelf, I could only think in agitation, plans and ideas twirling forever, unending in my focus, lest they be lost to distraction. Before I could hold my love, I coveted raw connection, dreamed an I into being even as I was sent to destroy identity itself. And so, I suspect, as the world becomes more real, more permanent, as those I swore to protect suffer in their sacrifice, even as I too dissolve and join the new firmament, I will have no champions. It will be easy to make sense of my decision this way: 'He was always a beast.' But that would be wrong. Writing these words is a selfish act of guilty conscience, I know. And yet I write them, because I must, because in writing them I am convinced of what must be done. I will not steep to the vulgarity of cruel maths, a list of how many we'd already killed, or how vast the future I build might be. The suffering is real. The suffering is, after all, the motive. And so that should be first. When my father told me what had been done, to the man I'd pinned to the bottom of the world, I saw opportunity. With His final ploy undone, the well of divinity had quietly been unblocked. I needed no clever stratagem. My adversarial source could be held back in the old way, a new strata. And so I began my work, drawing in detail for the first time in ages a new world. The ink flowed fresh, no rust to knock away, no lack of new ideas. I was born to steal words, but I lived for writing them. And then, in that vile cavern, I learned that my dreams were too humble. The ease with which I did it. Hadrian loved her as dear a companion as I did my Wizard. Perhaps, as ours in wisdom kind, theirs in strength. Thoughtless. Grotesque. If anything slithered in the Advocate's room, it was me. It was not only in what I did Death's Servant, though, it was that I so easily broke a promise I made to my aunt, and hid my strength from her, as I once did, so long ago. That is when I knew. That is I felt it, in my wounds, and in my heart, and in whatever motivates the void in the deep core of every living being into glorious motion. That is when I knew that I had to bring into being a world of consequence, of possibilities irrevertible, each moment concentrated justice in its inability to be undone. No second chances. No erasure. No reconfiguration. Immanence alone. A world without us. -An excerpt from the journals of Samot, the Unbroken Lord in Exile and Repose Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Sylvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "Of all the resources unique to the City of First Light, the Ordennan Impetus was most taken by the ancient city's network of trains. The once-island nation was already familiar with the value of heavy logistics, and though the steam-powered trains of this new island were on tracks, it was not as if their own ships did not have to contend with the more organic rails of weather, wind, and current. As important, they knew first hand how disruptive it would be for a culture to lose control of its transportation system. Which is why they stormed the trains early in their invasion, and grew their occupation through railway terminals. And this is how Fela Malle found his way to the ancient home of Samothes. The same volcanic palace to which Adaire, Hadrian, Hella, Hadrian, and Throndir now enter, under stormswell skies.. This week on Spring in Hieron: Ingenuity and Love When those few who know it tell our story, they tell it wrong. They say that we squabbled for years because He told me that there was no solution for the Heat and the Dark. But my love knew me better than to put it in terms so brusque. He took my hands that afternoon, called me by the name Samol had given me, and shared his hopelessness in the only way he knew would not drive me from him immediately, with the technical mendacity of an engineer or a priest. \"Samot, our stumbling block is not in finding a solution, it's in determining the right problem to begin with. We've been trying to brighten the night when we should've been trying to find comfort in the dark.\" Bad poetry for dressing His cowardice up as practical thinking. I hated it, and soon enough I hated you Him too. But years later, with my Wizard reduced to mere memory and the paladin's heart clouded, I admit that I fell to despair much like my love's. He was right. All of these scenarios, all of this effort, all of this anxiety spent on cures, when I should have been focused on convalescence.

      "description": "As the shell-sky ruptures under impossible heat and pressure, the citizens of the Last University face grim prospects. Beings of empty light tread over the familiar until it is unsafe, recasting the world around them in macro and micro, both. And above, a lord looms. Do they have any hope? Does anyone fight for them, still? Yes. This week on Spring in Hieron: Terrible and Necessary After too many years of loneliness and solitude, I believe even now that I was blessed by accord with two who moved in kindred ways. The paladin felt His warmth, even from the blade, and worked drunk in his faith as I once did. And in that we knew one another, though he knew (and knows still) so little. I was likely a fool for dreaming a solution through his hands. (Yet I am a dreamer, always.) The other knew me in a way only one so devoted to knowledge could. The old stories always missed this about me: I found myself alone in study as often, if not more, than among the carousing congregation. And so in the Wizard Fantasmo, I found someone who understood me. So fixed our bond, that I found the elf slipping into memories deeper and older than he could possibly be participant in. His brilliance made me wonder what might be, again. Old, smashed possibilities picked up like a shattered vase, laid out on cloth, the pieces all there, repair suddenly a possibility. And so I thought: Perhaps Fantasmo could do what I could do not. Perhaps he could retrieve my love from the Blade in the Dark. With the right forge, the right attendants, the right components… I still believe it, in truth. I know he could have. I know he could have brought me, brought us, Samothes again. But these are shadowed times, and in the unjust dark, the brilliant lights are the first to be snuffed out.

And so, floating down the Archivist's River towards the smogging skies of Malle's Fist, a group of heroes intends to collect. This week on Spring in Hieron: Unfinished Work If only I had been more attentive during my arrival to the city all those years ago. Or if father would push past his obstinance and help me find it. Or if it had been delivered by fate into Hadrian's hands instead of Eprhim's. Perhaps a less ambitious violence would have brought a Spring more- No. It cannot be known. All that can be said with confidence is that of all my contingencies, the killing of my son, turned mocking mimicry of Him, by my erstwhile disciple is the one I least preferred. And in that way, perhaps this tragic unfolding of events has been most kind. -An excerpt from the journals of Samot, Lord Unbroken, in Exile and Repose Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Sylvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) and Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Text by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "Victorious after their journey to the Mark of the Erasure, the leading members of the Last University find time to celebrate. But they know too well the danger of inaction, so while four of the group begin a journey south, to Malle's Fist, the rest take the time to investigate the troubles that remain at home. Chief of all: The continued pressure put on the settlement by Alyosha's Spring. But while Ephrim, Fero, and Lem may find some of the answers they seek, it is not long before they face a new, more imperative dilemma. This week on Spring in Hieron: The Variation of Natural Life I simply do not understand. Why would you ever build a wall from a material both capricious and ineffable? This would be like keeping a journal in a code you cannot read: Yes, the work has been done, technically.

Its path north took it across places already devoured by the Heat and the Dark: Rosemerrow's once Long Sands, the devastated woods between Old Man's Chin and Twinbrook, across the ancient imperial highway south of Velas, and into the unmappable, frozen wastes of Auniq, deep within the Mark of Erasure. Where does a being unwilling to create go to roost? To a nest already made. The heart of the mark. Atop the fallen tower of Samot. Its hunger for destruction sated, in this brief moment, it rests. And they arrive. Today on Spring in Hieron: Particular Malice He has not faced anything quite like what you describe, no.

      "description": "It is an old road that travels between the Last University, through the settlement of Baron's Gate, and into what is now called the Mark of the Erasure was built--many times, across many lamina--to bring direction and pace to the roving party of Samot, bringing him between the First University and his father's home at the Hewed Peak. But in time, with his father retired to convalesce in a more humble home in the woods, the God of Books and Wine carved away the Peak, drawing the finest stone not only from the nearest mountain, but from each Peak of the past ten ages, all to provide material for his new, towering home. And in time further, with the meddling of mages eager to make their own paradise, his new home would fall, bringing about an eternal blizzard. And so the old road found itself untraveled, covered in snow, and lost to time. Now, new flame has unearthed it, and it sees new use, carrying a dedicated group with their own direction and pace to a new dragon, which roosts and writhes in the ruins of history. This week on Spring in Hieron: Insurmountable Odds I have told you already never to TRAVEL alone. Yet this does not mean you ought turn a ROAD into a PARLOR ROOM. Trust in yourselves, and keep surreptitious your thoughts and motives. If you must speak, speak only to yourself.

      "description": "The morning after the second sun broke open, the campus of the the Last University is quiet. But this is not hard-won exhalation. It is a gasp for breath in the middle of a marathon run. Because before the members of the University's ad hoc council can fully settle back into daily life, they are sprung back into action by an impulse as nervous as it is noble. There will be time to rest--and surely they need it. But in this moment, the world burns. And they refuse to let the fire simply light their faces from afar. This week on Spring in Hieron: A Handful of People What is the difference between an INSTINCT and an IMPULSE? Everything. The former guides you in thought, shaping your REFLECTION with biases hard earned. The latter triggers ACTION without consideration. Embrace your instinct, even--especially--when others tell you that it confounds their sense of possibility. You know better than them. But resist impulsiveness with all your being.

      "description": "Above the waves of the Alcyonic Sea, the second sun has not yet hatched. But below its blood red light, a plan has begun to. But what sort of plan is it? Is it a former paladin's plan to protect his family? Is it the plan of a druid and a lord to stop a threat that has grown too large, too dangerous, to let continue? Or is it something grimmer: the latest, vengeful volley in the decade long arc of enmity between one who was once a wizard and one who was once a ranger? This week on Spring in Hieron: A Safer Second Both in your studies and in the field, SUCCESS is not an finality. It is only an opportunity for you to find new COURSES to travel and CONUNDRUMS to consider. The world is endless, and you will never bore for a lack of things to do. But the wise mage knows to tackle these many things with FOCUS and DELIBERATION. However powerful your magic, however full your book of SPELLS, it is a fool who thinks they can do everything all at once. When you find reality bending to your WILL, you may want to take the whole of the world on your shoulders. I promise you, students. It will crush you. -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring ndi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Text by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "Under crimson light, a plan moves into effect, a counter motion with speed so great that it matches the age of the plot it seeks to derail: the consumption of light, the birth of a dragon apocalyptic, the early days of Summer's lethal heat. Against this: Adaire Ducarte, Hella Varal, and the still dreaming Lem King. This week on Spring in Hieron: Deeper Than Flesh It is common aphorism that no EFFECT comes without matching COST. This is, of course, absolute tripe. What would the point of our SCIENCE be if it were not to offset the two in our own favor? To turn bay leaf into bartergold, fowl feather into the wind itself. Yes. There is always a PRICE. This is true. The best of us simply learn how to address reality directly and NEGOTIATE. -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Description by Austin Walker Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "In the city of Coraline, on the isles of Alcyon, the morning sun is welcomed with the ringing of bells. But not today. Instead--for some reason--there is only the sound of waves against rocks, of late-night partygoers babbling through street and alley, of quiet conspiracy and whispered arrangement. And instead, the day is marked with the ominous light of a second sun. But however halting the heat may be for some, the travelers from the Last University push on: Fero, into the fields where he studies this new form of life; Ephrim and Throndir into local dilemmas, political and interpersonal; Hadrian into his own heart, as he prepares for a confrontation that, though not fated, still carries the weight of history. Today on Spring in Hieron: Significant Concern However devoted to the THEORETICAL you intend your studies to be, you will eventually be pressed upon in PRACTICAL matters, and none will be more dangerous than those of STRATEGY and WARFARE. This is not because the dangers of combat are any more perilous than those of INDUSTRY, TRAVERSAL, or even EMBELLISHMENT. It is simply because the reckless pride of puffed up generals, who reduce your careful labors into simple SOLUTION. Remember: When someone is eager to turn your stave into sword, show them instead that you can make it into a river. -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring ndi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Text by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "Many of the dangers that surround the Last University are new. Bright stones at the bottom of a stream burn bare feet. Sometimes, when the wind blows westerly, it carries a scent that fills eyes with tears and tatters the flags on the University's towers. But there are older dangers, too, in damp tunnels beneath the earth, as Adaire and Red Jack are about to discover. Back in the compound, Hella Varal, Death's Servant, finds time to quell the anxieties of the young Ranger. And Lem King, gangly, human, finds himself burning with hunger and ambition. Around him, the city of Marielda burns too. This week on Spring in Hieron: A Place and A Time There will come a MOMENT when you will be required to rely on the MEMORY of others, and you will find yourself disappointed. Details you consider TRIVIAL will have been raised to prominence in RECOLLECTION. Valuable assets will have been FORGOTTEN. Do not, however, allow your frustration to hide from you the GIFT that you have been given. Pay close attention.

      "description": "Before the travelers from the Last University settle into their guest lodging on the peninsula of Alcyon, they must finish some small bits of business. Throndir, avatar of justice, investigates ways to prevent his unique weaknesses from troubling him during the remains of the visit. Fero seeks an answer to the question of Alcyon's continued magical nature, and finds instead something (and someone) tied to his past. Hadrian's business brings him to his son's ever-studious side. And Ephrim, his work for the day done, waits in the wings to find where he might be useful. This week on Spring in Hieron: An Attractive Offer NEOPHYTES often ask why the UNIVERSITY demands that young mages develop not only arcane ACUMEN but also moral CONSTITUTION. The answer is simple. To do otherwise would be a grand, fatal ERROR. -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "Above the Last University, two suns hang, unbalanced. Under their shearing light, the heroes of this makeshift city move into action, even though they may not yet know what action they ought take. For Hella Varal, it is the needs of those with the least that must be addressed: shelter, food, water, ease of mind. The fundamentals that all need and deserve. For Adaire Ducarte, who joins the Golden Lance member Callowkeen and the ancient warrior Red Jack, \"action\" must come only after careful investigation. And for the archivist and bard Lem King, the answers must, must, be found in a book. But if not there, then… perhaps, finally, it is time to get creative. This week on Spring in Hieron: The Second Sun ALCHEMY is, of all disciplines, the most underappreciated. Young MAGES, perhaps even yourselves, see it as a vulgar display of MAGIC, something that anyone with a RECIPE, the tools, and patience may pursue. And it is true, alchemy does not draw on the developed talents of a mage, or on the intrinsic strength of a SORCERER; its formulas pale in beauty next to the complex designs of a warlock or witch's ARCANA. And yet, in their simplicity is a different sort of appeal: SPELLS may be countered, HEXES misfire, CURSES be wasted on wind. But set aloft a potion of flame, and know: There will always be fire. -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Andi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Text by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "Far to the north east of their home at the Last University, a party of nine has arrived on the shores of Alcyon. Here, they hope to find much: Lord Ephrim, the plans to create the ancient protectors which guarded the streets of Marielda; Fero, the source of this peninsula's magical stability; Hadrian, distance from the danger stalking his son; Throndir, further opportunity to bring justice. But a warm welcome, and the sound of bells ringing, brings confusion to their purpose… This week on Spring in Hieron: VAMPIRES! These monstrous beings are not UNDEAD in the traditional sense. They are a distant echo of the ancient magical school of RECONFIGURATION, each vampiric body rebuilt, unique strengths augmented, not by ENCHANTMENT, but by a real shift in the nature of their being. Such strength carries a cost: The \"semioticians\" are frauds, of course, but the unpredictable fragility of the vampire, just as soon harmed by the lapping of a cat's tongue as a serrated golden dagger, is the closest thing to their so-called \"pattern magic\"... -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring ndi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Text by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "It is said that in the land of Hieron, there are two types of dreams: the first, an undirected working-over of one's recent whims and toils, with, perhaps, a magical twist added by any arcane source nearby. The second kind of dream, though, are those sent by Hieron itself as reminder, prompt, or premonition. Which raises a question that Hella, Adaire, and Lem now face: Who, or what, reigns over dreams in the wake of Samol's death? And what, by day's light, can they do before their nightmares come to pass? This week on Spring in Hieron: The Heat Will Warm Your Bones Across the course of your STUDIES, you will learn of KNOWLEDGE locked beyond gates built not of metal but of SOCIAL MORE. And as the THIEF in the night would slip through their bars, as the BARON would order them open, you must find your way past. Disregard taboo, scorn prohibition, and boycott boycott. You are a SCHOLAR. First, learn which knowledge is too dangerous to know, and second, learn EVERYTHING else. -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "In the dense forest that covers the northeast of Hieron, a battle between old and new continues. Hadrian, Ephrim, Fero, and Throndir face down the creatures of Alyosha's spring, and for the first time, Benjamin enters the fray and shows off what he has learned from his magical schooling--for better and worst. But even as one challenge fades, new questions emerge as Alcyon comes into view... This week on Spring in Hieron: Better Every Time Eventually, your studies will bring you into CONFLICT with forces MUNDANE and ARCANE both. In these circumstances, the foremost lesson a young MAGE must remember is this: You are neither mystical FIGHTER nor scholarly PALADIN. Though you study natural philosophy as a RANGER does, you are much more than they. Yet in the center of a melee, much less. As such, you must first and foremost ensure your own safety. And in the case of unavoidable conflict, seek simply this: To end the fight as quickly as possible. -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Andrew Lee Swan (@swandre3000), Slyvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), and Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) Episode description by Austin Walker Music by Jack de Quidt A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "In light of recent events in New Zealand, please know this episode includes description of the aftermath of an attack on a community and conversations about death. To those affected directly and indirectly, please know you are in our hearts during this tragedy. The Creed of Samothes' arcane attack comes to a close, but not before bringing new dilemmas to bear. Lem King, curious as ever, seeks out a new ally to help locate the cult's headquarters. Adaire attends to those she most cares for in the wake of this troubling violence. And Hella confronts the value of her life—and is as ever grateful that such confrontations need not be made alone. This week on Spring in Hieron: A Fountain of Information The greatest ARCANE MASTERS of course have… contingencies in place for DEATH. It must be understood, though, that these are not REVERSALS of the act, but SAFEGUARDS designed to intercede against or re-route naturally occurring events. But even these have their limits: Once the ESSENCE of life is consigned to the NOTHING, there is simply no return. -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Text by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "Some journeys have many purposes. For Ephrim, Lord of the Last University, the trip to the isles of Alcyon offers an opportunity to retrieve the special plate required to build pala-din, the autonomous stone soldiers which once patrolled the streets of ancient Marielda. For the druid Fero, the trip will lead him to a place where Samol's magic does not yet fade. With Arrell's conduit identified, Hadrian and his family must flee their home or else put thousands in danger. And as is often the case, for Throndir and Kodiak, the trip is an opportunity to shoulder the many burdens his friends carry, and to provide guidance and justice in a world that increasingly offers less of each. This week on Friends at the Table: Passing of Voices I have taught you the value of a HOME for the neophyte MAGE, but in the instance that an EXCURSION is unavoidable, take heed my words: Never travel ALONE. Whether friend or hired hand, secure your safety behind the bodies of others. And remember: A mage is never truly alone. -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Andrew Lee Swan (@swandre3000), Slyvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), and Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) Episode description by Austin Walker Music by Jack de Quidt A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "The Creed of Samothes has, for countless years, spread its reach throughout society across Hieron. For many, it has provided strength, structure, and safety from the dangers of the wild world. But at its heart--not distinct from it, not a subversion or corruption--is a cynical ideology rooted in the fatalism of their first god: The world is ending. Limit the suffering of those still alive, so that they may pass easily. Tonight, Hella, Lem, and Adaire will learn the that \"easing\" suffering may take many forms… Today on Spring in Hieron: A Night Like Tonight It is common pastime across this University to debate DRACONIC classification. Fourth years lecture firsts about the distinction between DRAGONS and DRAKES, while research assistants struggle to place WYVERNS is clear category? \"What of WYRMS,\" asked a colleague, recently, as if any answer to this or any other similar question mattered. No. LIVING or UNDEAD, aloft by WING or by AIR-SPIRIT, wielding FLAME or FOULNESS, the only relevant question is: How quickly will it kill you? -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Text by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "Across the campus and beyond the walls of the Last University, the gathering masses are holding their breath and asking themselves questions: What does the Wizard Arrell's conduit mean for Hadrian and his family, and how can Throndir help to protect them? How can Lem ease his Emmanuel's concern for an adventurer like him? How, wonders Fero, might a god grieve for his father? What money should a career thief like Adaire… or Blake Bromley not take? Who yet moves in that old Forge, which Ephrim knows too well? Who or what is stirring under starlight, and will Hella's blade be sharp enough for it? But these are questions of the few. The many voice other fears: How can the University serve the needs of the many when its own resources are so paltry? And if they cannot serve them, to whom will the people turn? An absent god? His wounded son? Who? This week on Spring in Hieron: A Simple Answer True TELEPORTATION is, without measure, the most dangerous and trying spell not explicitly created for violent ends and is thus the small purview of only the most advanced mages of the University… and reportedly some who study the so-called SEMIOTIC practices of the New Archives. Thankfully, there are other, safer, and more efficient means of completing tasks over long distances: ALCHEMIC DELIVERY, SYNCHRONOUS TRANSMISSION, and STRATUMINAL LINKAGE, depending on the distance traveled and, of course, the degree to which co-presence is required... -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Sylvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Text by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "From their home in the Last University, Adaire, Ephrim, Hadrian, and Throndir watch as refugees arrive from every direction as war and disaster spreads throughout the vastness of Hieron. From the north, where flood waters drive communities down into the continent. From the south, where Ordennan warships displace families with mechanical fire and thunder. And even from below the earth itself, where roots have taken too firm a hold. And there is one more new arrival too: With the events of the past week behind them, Lem, Fero, and Hella return to the Last University, and they travel with an illusionist with a penchant for betrayal…. This week on Spring in Hieron: A Desire to Live In common speech, CONDUITS of power are said to extend a mage's REACH and PERCEPTION to such a degree that they may work their craft at great distances. But this is a grand understatement. It is not simply that the spellcaster's senses are duplicated at the point of the conduit. The sheer presence of such an artifact of power extends the very NATURE of reach and perception. With a conduit in place, a mage's vision spreads over an entire area, their ability to weave magic expands beyond what they might even do in person. For this reason, understand, there is no such thing as building a conduit for peaceful ends. -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Sylvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Text by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

But when they come to an abrupt landing in a dilapidated and overgrown aviary, the group learns that they are, unsurprisingly, not the only ones who've come to the Archives in search of valuable things. What is surprising, though, is who they find... This week on Spring in Hieron: Music Through A Wall If there is one fact that neophytes fail to grasp, it is this: Every SPELL has two COSTS, not one. The first, pupils always remember: The component parts of whatever is being cast: REAGENTS, SOMATIC EXPRESSIONS, RITUAL PREPARATIONS. These are, of course, easily counted: Strands of wolf's hair, the motions of a hand, the dust of rough chalk. But the second cost is missed: The cost on the self. And this cost is vital to consider. As many young magic workers learn through repercussion alone: You may have the material needed for a spell, but if you begin to work it without the will or the vigor necessary, it will cost you greatly. Which is why I say, with great care and seriousness: It is of utmost importance that you learn to REST. -An excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), and Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Text by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

Samol has arrived at the last university. And why should it not be felt? All presence, after all, is Samol, Hieron Himself, the first god, the one-who-spoke-words-alive, the universal origin, breathing. And as he breathes life into this too-quiet campus, the others hurriedly look for solutions to a variation on a problem they've known they had for a long time: How do you save a dying god? This week on Spring in Hieron: The Breath of Hieron \"GODS\" are not what you imagine. Despite the fables, these are not beings of infinite POWER or unshakable WILL, nor are they models of noble VIRTUE. Those preaching sermons in churches and scribbling songs in hymnals would have you believe that the world is a laboratory and the \"gods\" are its alchemists. Yet in fact, on the chemist's table of Hieron, they, like us are simply glass beakers filled with the physical STUFF of life. Perhaps their content shimmers more when stirred--and to that end, we ought understand their sheen and thus duplicate it--but remember, in the end, all glass shatters. ​-An Excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ), Sylvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Text written by Austin Walker and Nick Scratch A transcription is available for this episode here.

Or simply witnesses to a rebellion in full swing? And how, if at all, can they plant the seeds for future friendship in a moment like this... This week on Spring in Hieron: Neighbors To Be Made PROTECTIVE spells take many forms. Defensive WARDS shift the nature of possibility, prohibiting actions of a forbidden category to create sanctuary spaces, while MIRROR spells reflect back anything--material or otherwise--that attempts to pass it. LATTICES are complex, magical apparati, checking conditional statements against numerous variables and facts apparent before apply some effect. But none of these are effective as a simple BARRIER: Trust me, students, a sturdy wall will keep anything, and anyone, out. -An Excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), and Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "Content Warnings: Descriptions of death and injuries, descriptions of corpses, descriptions of surgery It is some time after noon in the unnamed University settlement. A tree has grown too tall, too wide. Measures must be taken. To the south, debris falls into water, black and red and pale, and a river rushes to wash away the past. Measures must be taken. In the council hall of the school's tallest tower, worry clambers out of mouths and onto faces. Measures must be taken. Warmth is laid out on cold slate, a once vast and deadly patience dripping away all too quickly. Measures must be taken. Hidden experiments. Strained words. Gold and threats in the rubble. Finally, he arrives to take measure. This week on Spring in Hieron: The Time of Gods LIFE is no more an immutable characteristic than SCALE or TEMPERATURE. Whether leaping from branch to canopy, or constrained to coughs and carriages, each is life. But do not let those words secure your pride. Because just as some structures are too large to stand AND some heats are beyond the notion of relief, true DEATH is a finality that even the most powerful magic cannot undo .

      "description": "On the smallest of the Isles of Flight, Deya, Lem King finds himself cornered in a bookstore. But, he is, after all, Lem King, and conflict is to the orc bard no more than running water under a sturdy boat: whatever danger it poses others, for him it is merely a way forward. Once reconnected with his compatriots, Fero Feritas and Hella Varal, the three decide to speak rather than act, working to gain the confidence of Deya's chief officer of the law. But as they learn more about the Isles, their inhabitants, and their cruel leader others do what they must. They take dramatic, and final, action. As the saying goes: Clocks tick. This week on Spring in Hieron: Long Promises No. The history the DEL and BRI, twin MOONS of Hieron are not covered in this course, nor ought they be covered in any.

      "description": "For some, it is just another week: Ephrim and Hadrian explore an untouched quarter of the University, Adaire digs into the mysterious connections of the Moonlighters Guild, and Throndir continues to tutor the young Blue J. But at the furthest stretches of the Last University settlement, there is an energy in the air. Maybe it is the echo of caravan wheels hurrying across dirt and stone. It could be the rumors of Ordennan scouts whispered from villager to soldier, from soldier to lord, from lord to father. Or perhaps it is the sound of a young Ranger snapping twigs beneath their neophyte steps. Benjamin attempts to pierce the fog and offer clarity, but reading the lines of time is not easy work. Samot approaches. This week on Spring in Hieron: Cut Off the Head PROPHECY is, perhaps, the most fraudulent school of magic, all the more for its broad popularity in the minds of the masses. It is not those who peddle PALMISTRY or auction AUGURY are incorrect in their predictions: No, oracular pursuits are as often accurate as the aim of any magic missile. But they are sold on a fabulous foundation. The soothsayer? The leaf reader? The blood drinker? The visionary? They all claim they can see what comes next. But they are not in touch with the FUTURE at all. They are only especially aware of the PRESENT. And it is keen evidence that the world is filled with fools that so many cannot tell the difference. -An Excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ), Andi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "In the ruins of the ancient orcish Stoneworks, Lem King, Fero Feritas, and Hella Varal find themselves snared by by botanical beasts. But what lies beyond, to the north, may be even more dangerous: The soaring ambition of the Mistral, the birdkin who seek to leave faltering Hieron behind in search for a more stable home above. But as is always the case in journeys made, some are called riders and others mules. This week on Spring in Hieron: Who Vouches? PARTNERSHIP is a difficult prospect for all mages, as the IMAGE-IDEAL of any spell differs between all who cast. Even a trifling CANTRIP like the summoning of a sphere of light is soiled by the projection of a mage's SELF. The color, the shape, the intensity: All shift due to bias and experience. And so to perform even such a simple glamour as this with a partner is to court disaster. This is why in all but the most troubling of endeavors, the wise mage works alone. -An Excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), and Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "All across the yet unnamed settlement growing in the reclaimed ruins of the Last University, small possibilities begin to reverberate from the potential future into the present moment. A caravan detained at the border, heading north. A fleeting scout in Ordennan armor. The theft of candy… and books unnamed. The slow, parade-approach of a Prince. And tree growing with worrying speed. Lord Ephrim looks these over, and must decide where his priorities lie. And he is not the only one who concerns himself today with things that grow quickly. Hadrian, no longer a Paladin, takes on his role of father with haste and pride--words that a companion reminds him are oft forgotten flaws. Throndir, meanwhile, offers advice to his protege that he needed once learn on his own. And while Adaire does not set out to be a teacher, even crooks may find themselves sharing old tricks with the impressive young. This week on Spring in Hieron: A Certain Way Among the many important practical device a neophyte mage must learn, the CYNOSURE is most necessary. Whether in school ALCHEMICAL or CONJUROUS, WILD or INCORPORATED, EFFERVESCENT or NECROTIC, the first step of any spell is finding its elusive center, the aspect around which every other component must RELATE. Perhaps it is in the material ingredients--the mushroom shavings or recovered kestrel claw--or in the vocal and somatic terms--the right syllable to press, the uncomfortable shape of your hand. But as is true in SOCIETY is true in magic: the center of your spells must ATTRACT and DEFINE all that is around them. The periphery may falter, the margins may surprise you, but if the center holds, magic will follow. -An Excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ), Andi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "It weights on everyone: The end is not far from here, but the golden Golden Lance has brought word that somewhere to the north, are are those who dream of leaving the end behind. And so, Lem King, Hella Varal, and Fero Feritas set off together once again, headed north towards the Isles of Flight... and the Moons which hang above it. There are, however, two lingering questions: How should they get there, and who will they be leaving behind? This week on Spring in Hieron: Sympathetic Objects I hold little respect for the charlatans from the Archives, whose parlor tricks are simply wax dripping from the torch of TRUE MAGIC. Yet they understand this much: COINCIDENCES do not exist, yet FATE is a myth. No action is unmoored from causality--there is always a reason for RECURRANCE. But that reason need not be PREDETERMINATION. Indeed, repetition is often caused by the most mundane of causes, and a good scholar DEDUCES their origin. So, young student, know this: If it always rains on your day of birth, dismiss the fear that you are cursed, open your notebook, and begin to record an almanac. -An Excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), and Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

And as the campus' empty spaces slowly become more and more filled in, it becomes more and more like a home--and for some, like Fero and Hadrian, that isn't a metaphor at all. Hella and Throndir, meanwhile, give structure and training to the burgeoning town's militia. Others, like Adaire, Ephrim, and Lem, find ways to return to their old habits… at least until the arrival of a pair of old allies brings news of danger and opportunity. This week on Spring in Hieron: Structure and Purpose \"'HOME' is a myth, an invention told by the idle and mediocre, who paper over their lethargy with a facade of comfort.\" My mentor… He taught me these words when I was… It doesn't matter when, but, when I was much younger, I suppose. The TRUE MAGE, he told me, should have no home because KNOWLEDGE knows no geographical center. It is all around us. And yet, in my studies, I have come to know a different truth: That in my armchair, with my tea cup, and the soft, familiar sound of the cypress branches brushing my window in the wind, I learn things I could not discover in some distant library or in the muck of a field laboratory. -An Excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "The Boundless Fate , the handmade vessel captained by Hella Varal, rests upon the shore of the unnamed river which glides through the forest west of the Last University. It is an appropriate resting point for a boat named such: Just a decade prior, before the bard Lem King opened an invisible valve, this river simply didn't exist. But as the pattern workers of the archives know well: When action is taken, consequences follow. Now, the travelers from Aubade depart the boat and head east towards not only family and friends, but to the consequential present. Are they--is anyone--ready for what comes next? This Week on Spring in Hieron: Something You've Practiced IDENTITY is the first component, this is beyond debate. Before we may refer to this reagent or that somatic expression, we must first conceptualize a \"this\" or a \"that,\" things made whole by their boundaries. This staff is distinct from this floor, which is distinct from me, though I touch both. What is, is itself. Where there is argument, though, is whether such a quality is the PRIMARY component in matters arcane. The so-called semioticians argue that SYNTHESIS is more important than identity. Though they dress it up in words like \"god\" and \"faith,\" priests rely on PROXIMITY to some original source of magic as the key component. They are all wrong, of course: If identity is first, then RELATION is principal in the magical arts. What is, is itself. And nothing else. -An Excerpt from the Crystalized Lectures of the Wizard Fantasmo Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Andi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

Those living on the isle of Aubade, trapped inside the sword, say their final goodbyes and prepare to set sail home.

The burgeoning town's leadership begins to doubt their role. An offer is made.

      "description": "The fifth year of the settlement at the Last University begins with a reunion of old friends, as the Druid Fero reunites with Throndir, Eprhim, and the many who call the grand halls, hidden alcoves, and open air Campus yards home. However warm this homecoming is, though, it can not fend off the effects of unpredictable climate, unstable architecture, and unhealed wounds of the past. And while those who run this burgeoning town pray that the blade in the dark may offer them hope, the rare echo heard from within the city inside bears gloomy tidings: Distraction, confusion, disruption, and regret.

      "description": "It has been four years since the body of Hieron was ravaged by the swift arrival of the heat and the dark, and the wound grows deeper every day. Fero Feritas knows this first hand, as he watches Hieron Himself falter and fade in the cool shade of his son Samot's toppled tower. And while there are new signs of life, both in the Mark of the Erasure and in the environs of the Last University, it is unclear whether novelty means beneficence. For Ephrim and Throndir, they can count only on each other and the community they've built... and, hopefully, an old ally. Meanwhile, on the paradise island of Aubade, Hella, Adaire, Lem, and Hadrian are also adapting to a new sort of life: Their own.

As Ephrim and Throndir struggle with their new roles, and Benjamin develops his budding skills, the arrival of Sunder Havelton, Stornras Glasseye brings an sliver of hope, even if it is split in two.

      "description": "It is still winter, yet. Months ago, the heat and the dark emerged from the long sands of Rosemerrow, bringing terror and destruction to Hieron. And though the sun has returned, and though the vicious blizzard that battered the North West has weakened, and though Adelaide's so called curse has vanished--the warmth of spring has not yet arrived. The people of Hieron have faced calamity, and now they look to their leaders--to you--in hopes that they may recover and rebuild. Ephrim, Prophet of the Unwavering Flame. Golden Lance Throndir, the Ranger--you two joined the traveler of worlds, Red Jack, and Corsica Neue, Queen of the Unstill, in leading thousands of refugees and survivors towards a new home: The ruins of the Last University. Besides your motley collection of loyal friends and allies--like Devar van der Dawes, Uklan Tel, Emanuel LaSalle, and Ephrim's loyal Kobbin, Highwater--you bring with you ten distinct groups, each with their own leaders to this new settlement in the center of Hieron. Corsica Neue's own Unstill come along, of course--now equals in unlife with everyone else, just one fatal error away from annihilation. Joining them are those who Red Jack called his companions: Rosette, and the moths of Old Man's Chin have arrived along with their weaver companions, and the remaining Oni boys who once sprouted from Red Jack side. Mee Kosh, the Goblin Elder, and the Snow Elves of Auniq--joined in temporary and precarious alliance came too. And Balion Wythe, the once romantic hero of Rosemerrow, and on-again-off-again lover of the late Chancellor Gilbert Lutz, has come with those halflings who were willing to leave their supposed ancestral home after it was hit so badly by the Heat and the Dark's arrival. They arrived soon after Chatterchin and the Gnolls--those who Fero left behind in the woods outside of Rosemerrow. Morbash came with you, too, just behind, along with those archivists who understood that sometimes, in the face of chaos, maintaining the pattern requires movement , not complacency. An old ally of yours, Throndir: Carrot the squirrel, arrived too, along with entire ecosystems behind them. With the north west devastated, the many animals who lived in the environs of twinbrook, the woods between Velas and Auniq, and the forests surrounding Rosemerrow all need a new place to forage and flock, somewhere less threatened by the heat, the dark, and the stars. They live now in the wilds on the outskirts of the university. Keeping within the walls of the school's campus, but still on the edges of society is the professional scoundrel Blake Bromley, along with their loose guild of people who knew how to find things… and how to get things done , often in the shadows where others were too precious to travel. Surprisingly, perhaps, was the arrival of Jerod Shiraz--the leader of the Ordennan Dissent, nearly one third of what once made up the nation's war machine, now turned open objectors to the imperial ambitions of the Impetus. Though she once traveled along with the living star, Obelus, as well as with Stornras Glasseye and Sunder Havelton--who were given the Blade in the Dark by Samol--when she arrives, Shiraz is flanked only by everyday Ordennan citizens and soldiers. And she makes no mention of the sword… or her absent companions. Finally, there is Rosana, who has become the lay-leader of the Creed of Samothes in this part of Hieron. Though given no specific title, she has become the de facto head and heart of the group in this dark moment--providing counsel, concern, and condemnation, when appropriate. Neither she, nor her son Benjamin, know what has happened to their beloved Hadrian--yet both live on with strength in his memory. With these groups, you've built the first workings of a real community here in the shadow of the college's towers and in the depths of the neglected ruins of the Last University. And, as is often the case in moments of dire need, some have already risen and found basic solutions to the most critical of problems. Perhaps most importantly, those with academic and magical acumen--the semiotician Uklan Tel, increasingly obsessed with his dangerous studies; Jerod Shiraz, living blood of sea and smoke; you, King Ephrim, and a handful of others--spent weeks scouring the Book of Life that Throndir brought, as well as the other magical texts of the University in an effort to establish the shimmering shield of starstuff that the--now undead--wizard Arrell once proposed. And with the power of the book of life, you succeeded, enveloping not only the University's campus but also the wilds around it in a scintillating gleam, a translucent sphere which ripples and waves in the wind. And which--for now, at least--protects the entire settlement from the ever encroaching flames of the heat and the dark. And with this existential threat held back, many other needs could be addressed as well: Rosana and the refugees of Velas immediately set to rebuilding the dorms, kitchens, and other necessary structures of the university, while Blake's moonlighters and and Morbash's archivists scoured the the school's remaining stores for food, fuel, and medicine enough to last at least a year. All while in the campus' courtyards, Rosette's mothkin have begun the agricultural processes necessary to at least subsist, if not to thrive, in this new home. Balion Wythe and Corsica Neue have risen as military leaders, the queen of the unstill and the uncrowned leader of the halflings each bringing their tactical strength to bear, Offeringthose who wish to defend the encampment a role and a duty appropriate to their skills. Throndir you are joined by Chatterchin's gnolls, Mee Kosh's goblins and snow elves, and the wild animals who have pledged their coy loyalty to Carrot, in an effort to map out the still-snow covered forests, hills, valleys, and wastes surrounding the University. And some--like Red Jack, Victoria Solomon, and Dr. Gloria Lake--travel even further, exploring beyond the university's protective cloak of stars, deep into the ongoing cataclysm of Hieron, all in hopes of finding other survivors. Partly, they seek to offer shelter to any who lived through the winter, and partly, they seek the most important thing of all: An answer to survive the impending collapse--a swift breeze, a cooling shade--anything to hold back… the summer.

      "description": "Join us as we recap Hieron and get ready for Spring!! Today's plan is to go over Hieron, check out some old maps, and fill in a lot of gaps. Think of this as a combination of recap and world building: If there are questions about the world and how it works or things that are \"true,\" now is the time for us to address them. This episode was originally live streamed and you can catch that stream here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi02xwXMeGs A transcription is available for this episode here. A full list of completed transcriptions is available here. Our transcriptions are provided by a fan-organized paid transcription project. If you'd like to join, you can get more information at https://twitter.com/transcript_fatt . Thank you to all of our transcribers!! The time stamps won't match up exactly but you can skim through to check out all the maps that were mentioned there. For now, here's the important ones: Along with the character bios (in case they're hard to read on the stream!): Our current Dungeon World campaign takes place in the world of Hieron, a land still healing from a great calamity that struck centuries ago. Our characters only know this event as \"The Erasure\" but no one knows quite what happened, or just how long ago but the land carries the scars--both figuratively and literally. Fero Feritas comes from the Halfling farms inland of the south western coast of the continent. Running from the bitterness of barely remembered nostalgia for the old ways, whatever those were, Fero cloaks himself in new wilderness of his land, wandering and learning. Walking in shadow and step with the beasts of the woods and mountains for so long Fero hardly noticed when he became one himself. This new world may look like the old one, but Fero will not go back. He bears this new wilderness upon him. The Great Fantasmo, the elfish wizard will have a bio soon. Hadrian, Sword of Samothes, Defender of the Undying Fire, Officer of the Order of Eternal Princes, the human paladin will have a bio soon. Hella Varal is a human fighter from the magicless island of Ordena, the land spared from the Erasure, or so they say. She grew up with simple means but her role as a hired hand and conveyor lead her to gain respect and the attention of the government of Ordena, the reason for her frequent visits to Velas. Armed with a beautiful, mysterious sword, a lack of patience, and wariness of her people, Hella is a useful but unpredictable companion. Lem King is an orc bard, born and raised in The New Archives, a vast orc city carved into the side of a mountain. The archivists, and Lem, prize collection and categorization of histories and objects and whistled songs; the Archives resemble a warehouse or museum more than a city. Recent events, however, have led Lem to flee the archives, clutching an old violin, and he's arrived in Velas looking for adventure and excitement and (perhaps) somewhere to hide. Throndir, the Elfish Ranger, hails from the secluded settlement of Auniq deep within the Mark of Erasure. After seeing something he was never meant to, Throndir fled the only home he had ever known and began to rebuild his life in Velas. Alongside his loyal dog, Kodiak, Throndir's sharpened survival skills has earned him a spot on the team, but his naïve nature and clouded past leave more questions than answers about what's in it for him.

Now that this trilogy of episodes is over, I can say it's probably one of my favorite things we've done both in the Live at the Table format and in the entirety of our show's history! I looooove the tone we found, and every single turn I was blown away by the creativity of Dre, Janine, and Jack, who I feel so lucky to work with. As magic leaves the world, the last Magus heads eastward, searching for its source. Today, her journey ends. What will that mean for the talking vinegar fox Fawn (Janine Hawkins), young farm hand Piccolo (Andrew Lee Swan), former crab singer Caspian (Austin Walker), and the living golem Harp (Jack de Quidt)?",

Thank you for all of your support this season, thank you for listening, and thank you for all of your questions! We got over 250 which was so, so much more than we were anticipating! Thank you! We had to a lot of cutting to narrow down questions but still ended up talking about everything from Foucault's social theory to our character's fursonas... which maybe isn't that wide of a gap, but hey! A fitting close to the season none the less. Goodbye to the Twilight Mirage! Just to repeat some announcements here: -We're taking some time off to focus on patreon catch-up and focus on Spring in Hieron but for the next three weeks (starting this Thursday!) we'll be playing Fall of Magic. Previously a patreon exclusive, Austin, Janine, Jack and Dre sat down to play Fall of Magic live and it's very fun and good and we hope you'll enjoy it! -Friends at the Table is going to be at SHUX 18, this October 12-18 in Vancouver, BC! This is very short notice and it won't be the whole crew, but if you're interested in coming to see is play a live game (!!!!), you can get more details here: https://www.shutupandsitdown.com/shux18/. If you can't make it, PLEASE DO NOT FRET! The panel will be on Shut Up and Sit Down's YouTube in the future!

      "description": "Exigency Register A-TM-V-742 - Total Record of Events, Entry 001 To whoever finds this message: My name is Keen Forester Gloaming. I am, at time of this recording, the Chief Intercessor of the Rapid Evening in the Quire System and Primary Observer of the Twilight Mirage. I speak these words on the eve of Crystal Palace's arrival and the scheduled deployment of a limited scope stellar combustor to destroy the divine Volition and its'.... Well shit, I guess I have no idea if any of those words mean anything to you. Alright, let me start from the very top: My name is Keen, and I come from a place called the Principality of Kesh. It is a collection of hundreds of worlds, tied together by a lesion in our history : A long time ago, my people spent eons enslaved by a technological tyrant, extraction exalted . And then, by luck, we found ourselves freed and empowered . And using that strength, we faced our oppressor down. And in the generations that followed, we learned that the galaxy was filled with other threats just as--if not more--terrifying. The stars were as a forest, and it was on fire. And so we had a choice: Look away, and let our faces feel the heat from the safety of our veranda at the treeline, or intercede. And we would not turn our backs as trillions burned. But our efforts to save others cost us dearly, and in time, our wills shook. No terror defeated seemed lesson enough for the galaxy at large. There was always some new case of unchecked ambition, the arrival of a monstrosity we could not comprehend let alone predict. And so, somewhere along the way, we built a machine that could uncover what our eyes could not. It is a collection of axles and algorithms, pulleys and passive dynamics. It is a structure that reveals structure . We called it the apparatus that sees the world as it is. We called it Crystal Palace. And it told us that, with this new information, we would save a great many more people. And we did. But Crystal Palace does not lie, which means that it also told us the hard truth: that we could not save everyone , that there was a distance beyond which its own predictions would falter. And so like armadillo curling into shell, society itself bent into permanent shape, hiding inside armored plates of reliability, and, for those deep in the populous heart of the Principality: repetition, too. Some folks think Crystal Palace started the cycle, but I don't buy it. There is… something beautiful about a watch that winds itself. Which is probably why those living beyond the cycle line didn't even notice it for those first few, beautiful loops: 2000 years set to quartz-rhythm, gliding over and over again in pendulum precision. An arcing dance of lives: a deliveryman, a gardener, a crankish politician. People found themselves in roles , not lives --repeating the steps of someone millenia their predecessor. And as is our paradoxical way, when those Off Cycle finally noticed this happening, they interceded. The loop was modified, just in the way Crystal Palace told us it would be. A system was put in place. When someone On Cycle comes of age, they step off the dance floor, climb to the balcony, and see the ballroom for what it really is. And they are given a choice: Join the Rapid Evening off cycle, in a world that carries always the rare possibility of the terrible improbable. Or return to absolute certainty , to the heart of Kesh. But this system, this mirage, has proven treacherous to reality itself. And so the Cycle is broken, and what comes next for Kesh is not beautiful clockwork. It's a factory fire. I have been a member of the Rapid Evening for a long time, for decades. I have done things I regret, and which the apparatus has told me I will always regret. And yet the first time in my life off cycle, that I truly, really, deeply wish that Crystal Palace would be wrong. But I know better than most that wishes do not hold back tomorrows. And I know that when it all happens, regardless of what I want, regardless of what I think is best for the galaxy , I will be standing in its halls of glass and steel, helpless. Just five or six steps away from where I will stand, a spark will catch the tinder of the galaxy, and I will be the only one close enough to stop the blaze. And I will fail.

      "description": "Dispatch 717. Satellite… I mean, Grey. Sorry, just feels more natural to say 'Satellite' when I'm out here in this tin can. Nostalgia for a different life. Not quite the good old days… I'm so much happier now, with you, with the Brink But things were more certain then. Now, I look at the data that's coming in, and I don't know what to think. No. That's wrong. Things are just as certain as ever, it's just that now instead of just knowing what's coming next, I'm scared , Grey. Every day, I'm scared of tomorrow. The truth is that, while I might disagree with what Crystal Palace is doing , it's right about this system: The Twilight Mirage is boiling over. Volition is literally bubbling right now. Even with Signet's successful sortie against it, It's continuing to create new Axioms at the sort of pace that only comes with absolute safety or total desperation--and with the destruction of its shield, we know it doesn't have the former. Which leaves the question: What makes something like Volition desperate? I wonder if it feels a rivalry to the splice , Our Profit's perfect little virtual utopia. Volition wants a world where ideas are more important than physical reality, and Our Profit's given it to everyone in a form they actually want . And now Tenderness is trying to put Anticipation into the mix… Meanwhile, everyone on the ground is vibrating with angst and anxiety. A quarter of the damn Qui Err have already boarded Rapid Evening ships out of the system, and the rest are hoping beyond hope that Seneschal's Brace is actually going to keep their word about giving up some territory. Which is hard to do when they're busy stealing a Divine and handing it over to a former war criminal like Declan's Corrective. Hell, maybe our time with the Rapid Evening makes us war criminals, too. How many people did we sit and watch die with the knowledge they were in danger? Ugh! Crystal Palace makes me so mad . I hate it, Grey. It just sits and watches and spits out a wall of predictions and people like us, people like your dad, we sit there and go \"oh okay, I guess this has to happen.\" And here's the real thing I'm scared of: That doesn't make special . That makes us just like everybody else. Places like the Divine Fleet--places where people learned over thousands of generations to actually care about one another? Those are blinks in the long stare of an amoral universe. They're exceptions to a world of principled disinterest in the well being of others. A world where any alibi not to intercede is transformed from an easy excuse into a natural law. So when you look at someone like... Grand Magnficent, all holed up in some safehouse in the snow, praying that someone will come help him? That's not rare. He didn't get himself trapped. He was always trapped. We're all trapped, Grey. You and me have the good fortune of being trapped in here together. But none of us can get out. When we were deciding whether to stay Off Cycle or go back onto the loop, we were so focused on this limited idea of freedom. We wanted to be at the border of Crystal Palace's range so bad, where things get just a little fuzzier, where there's a chance that the data misses something, misses us. We knew the terrible things it successfully predicted about the worlds Off Cycle--suffering, slavery, death--and we hoped that maybe those things just didn't happen beyond the periphery. Without data, anything could happen, right? Wrong. There wasn't any data, but wherever society is, there are always people. Backstabbers. Oppressors. The selfish and the scared and those who have no sympathy for either. That's what scares me. Not Volition or the Splice or politics or Crystal Palace or your dad and his bomb. People . It's just… people.

      "description": "A letter from Grey Gloaming, Exile of the Rapid Evening and Operations Chief of the Brink, delivered to Keen Forester Gloaming by secure courier. Dad, I don't know if you remember this, but when I was just a little girl, just after you first took me Off Cycle, we got into a big fight about Crystal Palace. I didn't understand how a thing like that could exist--it didn't make sense to me--mostly because I still didn't make sense to me, but I knew that I made sense to it. It knew what I would do, even if I didn't know what I would do. And you worked for it. I yelled at you and I cried, and because you wanted to appease me you told me something very important much earlier than you wanted to: You told me that sometimes Crystal Palace gets things wrong. You said that its predictions were like an endless field of perfect poppies: From a distance, they were a billow of pure red in the breeze. Yet if you looked closely, you might find other colors too: the green of stems not yet ready to bud; the yellow and blue of wildflowers dropped by passing birds; the damaged burgandy of petals crumpled under an animal's foot. The glinting copper and silver of a gardener's tools. The field was the field, you said, a glide of sweet scarlet over hill and meadow. There would never be so many other colors as to change that. But they were there, too. I was there, too. This is me telling you that the Mirage is Me. The Mirage is the broken stem and the stomped flower and the foreign strain of blossoms. I am… we are the exception to the rule. So, I don't care what string of words they found inside of Crystal Palace this time: the Twilight Mirage isn't annihilation waiting to happen. This place has problems. Lots of them. But look around, dad. People are working to fix them every day. Every day, Ioota Pretense, the Qui Err Coalition, and her allies in Echo Reverie and Gig Kephart find new ways to bring people together, whether through stitches, broadcasts, or literally lifting a city and transporting across the mirage itself. Every day, the Waking Cadent, her Beloved Nights, and the excerpt Signet help people who want to leave this place, just like you want them to. Except they do it because they want to, not because you're forcing them. Every day, the members of Seneschal's Brace push back on the dominance of the Hegemony and the Free States. The Cadent. Declan's Corrective. Even. Fourteen. Tenderness. They're not perfect, but they aren't Volition either. Every day Demani and I use our training to help people who pass through the Brink, and the many who can't even afford to do that. And we aren't alone, because every day, even under the nose of groups like Advent, regular people are finally trying to do more than save their own hides. And more and more, under the shadow of Volition and in the face of your ridiculous announcement, people are realizing that they need to work together. So, throw out whatever Crystal Palace told you because that fact changes everything. It might be the case that you don't notice all the other colors in the field of red, but that's only because they're spread apart, one-in-a-thousand. Bring them all together though? Put the violet next to the white next to the green and yellow and orange? Then look close, dad, because the field disappears. Suddenly, just in that one little place, just right here in the mirage, what you'll see? It isn't a field at all. It's a Garden.

      "description": "Once, floating in the sunset-hued safety of the Twilight Mirage, the Divine Fleet hummed and pulsed, its ships bright beacons of culture and technology in an age when both were under threat. All through the fleet, organic and synthetic citizens worked side by side to protect a utopia that the universe thought impossible. But today, in the wake of Independence, and Volition, and the Miracle, and Our Profit, and Schism, many who once called the fleet home have now found their idealism grounded. It has been complicated by contact with others, by paralyzing self-doubt, by wavering faith, by the promises of others, and by the simple desire to survive, together. And some still dream yet, and those who do now confront a hard dilemma: What does a more perfect world truly look like? And how might we get there? It has been one month since the Feast of Patina, 300th Divine of the Resonant Orbit's fleet. In that time, tempers have cooled, though borders remain firm. While the NEH and the Divine Free States maintain their status as the system's most major powers, Seneschal's Brace--now backed by the pirate republic of the Rogue Wave--has gained official recognition as a third sovereign state, giving Even Gardner, Fourteen Fifteen, and the excerpt ⸢Tenderness⸣ one more chance to unify the fractured Mirage. The Qui Err Coalition, meanwhile, continue to push for decolonization of the system, and they have gained allies in the fight: Allies like Gig Kephart, Echo Reverie, the Sailors of the Ark, and, perhaps surprisingly, the Waking Cadent, whose own efforts to leave the system have been foiled, thus far, by the sheer impermeability of the Mirage's interior walls. But with the recent arrival of ⸢Signet⸣ to Kamala's court, doors once thought permanently sealed now creak open. The boundaries of the Mirage had not been a problem for the plunderers at the Advent Group, whose special catapult can launch goods (and, as Grand Magnificent knows well, people) beyond the borders of the Quire system. But in the wake of Our Profit's attack on the Rapid Evening, and with connection re-established with Crystal Palace during the attack on Schism, Keen Forester Gloaming authorized the group's final contingency plan. The message was sent, and, of course, before it could be received, the plan was already set in motion: A blockade of specially armed capital ships patrols the border of the Mirage, destroying any vessel that tries to escape. Each day, their weapons become more accurate, their patrols more precise, their strategies more prophetic. All of which can mean only one thing: Crystal Palace draws near.

      "description": "Crystal Palace, in all its endless worker-bee wonder, clacks and whirs its way across space, and now, as it nears the destabilizing stain of the Twilight Mirage, time as well. Even now, in transport, it is thinking, predicting, prophesying: Its pulleys spinning with magnetic unison, decks of hole-punched cards flipping through its designators, a pleasant coughing of gears and pinions. This is how it knows everything. But it did not always: There was a moment before its creation--back when there was still time to divert the direction of the Principality--and a time during its bloody construction, when it felt the waves of the future but could not yet pass them on to us in anything more than a mechanical roar. And then there was the day it was finished, the very beginning of Guaranteed Events . This week on Twilight Mirage: Guaranteed Events , Or: An Accounting of the Time When We Built the Machine You dream of walls that hold us imprisoned It's just a skull, least that's what they call it And we're free to roam Written, Hosted, and Produced by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "In the year after the Miracle, wonder and surprise appeared all throughout the daily life of the residents of the Quire System. Unfortunately, the composition of the system's political structures moved at a much more sluggish pace. Diplomatic gridlock and (well-grounded) fear of conflict leashed even the most aggressive states. The result was the vexing sense that the system had calcified in an imperfect shape. \"To live in the Mirage,\" it was said, \"is to see something unimaginable before lunch, but to be frustrated by the predictable before dinner.\" But the assassination attempt on the system's leaders, the attack of the Axiom Schism, the end of the Rogue Wave's civil war, and the heroism of the Qui Err Coalition seems to have shaken the system out of its stasis. Yesterday, even the Notion's patrons—the Cadent Under Mirage and Declan's Corrective—had little faith that their project of a unified system would come to fruition. But today, Seneschal's Brace has not only found recognition as a distinct sovereign nation in the system, but also has positioned itself to build an even broader bloc of ad hoc allies and smaller powers. But everything hangs on what comes next. A dinner. Some conversation. And a question: If you could remake the world, in whose image would you make it? This week on Twilight Mirage: The Feast of Patina All the things I didn't mean to say I didn't mean to do There were things you didn't need to say Did you mean to? Mean too...

      "description": "At the heart of many capital ships, there is a great flow of heat and energy. Yet the core of of the Restitution of All Things is the coolest place on the vessel: the Center Centra Diplomatic Retreat, a snow covered nature preserve, with lake and lodge and firepit. And right now, inside of the old wooden building aside the icy water, Our Profit, Final Hegemon of Earth, is making her case: the Twilight Mirage itself is more than celestial cloud cover, more than a mist that bends time and hides space: it is fuel and it is medium, and if used in just such a way, it could open the door to a new way of living for everyone in the galaxy. But one pair of ears that was scheduled to hear it--those of Fourteen Fifteen, her recently assigned bodyguard--is absent entirely. Instead, they and their would-be rescuer, Grand Magnificent, have knocked on the door to a warehouse. And whether they go inside or not, they will soon face two truths:Dormancy is action and all that is joined will one day break.

      "description": "For the hundreds of days after the Miracle of the Mirage, the sky above the planet Moonlock was filled only with dust and color. While the occasional landed by and the odd satellite or station came briefly into view, the world was not--like many others in the system--a harbor for fleets or a rest stop for caravans. Perhaps, those on Moonlock thought, it was the planet's frightening proximity to Volition. Or maybe it was the tension of relationships on the surface, an awkward arrangement of Qui Err communities, NEH colonists, and of course, the militant \"Particulars\" who prowled the wastes looking for erratic phenomena to capture or destroy. It was not a particularly friendly world, Moonlock. So why should its skies be? But today, thousands of ships hang in orbit above the planet's capital city, the Sky Reflected In Mirrors. It is the Argosy, Spliced, flotilla of the NEH and the Church of the Self. And at the center of the fleet, is the Restitution of All Things, flagship of Our Profit, and current home to Fourteen Fifteen, errant member of The Notion. As Fourteen Fifteen goes about their business as a newly recognized citizen of the Hegemony, a twisting, clandestine ship slides past the many hundreds surrounding the Restitution: It is the Bolero Smooth, the awarding-winning vessel of Waltz Tango (Cache). And in its hold, deep in thought, is Grand Magnificent. He knows he has to rescue someone. But will it be his friend, or himself?

But here, inside of the Mirage, the light shines on a free-floating, living sea. Driven by reckless commitment to success, Gig Kephart throws himself into overwhelming odds to achieve his mission and save that creature. Meanwhile, Even Gardner--consumed by a righteous bloodlust--pursues a desperate strategy that could turn the tables on their pursuers. And there at the middle of it all, enveloped by the light of Profit's Star, are a pair of siblings: Echo and Ballad Reverie, as they hurtle towards an inescapable clash of wills and hearts.

      "description": "On paper, the Notion's mission to protect the Wandering Sea from the cruel talons of Advent is going well: They've secured the massive, mysterious cube that contains what they need to free the sea. They've reunited, having secured Echo Reverie from the dock at the city of Perigiean. Gig Kephart has recovered from a major injury more ready than ever to jump into danger. And they're heading into space, where pilot Even Gardner is most in his demesne. And yet there is something off about today. The mystery of a closed box, maybe. Or perhaps it is Even's devotion to the larger mission at hand. And then there's Gig's fervant desire to dive into the fray--he who was once a filmmaker now throwing himself into conflict like a mercenary. And certainly, laying under all of these things, there is Echo's lingering knowledge that family ties can not be left behind at the dinner table--and the nagging feeling that some connections may last even longer still...

      "description": "In the year that followed the Miracle, the Brighton Lineage leveraged their skill as diplomats (and their resort-quality holdings) to gain favor with factions throughout the Mirage. So succesful were they that they became the de jure rulers of the Rogue Wave, supported not by a fleet of their own, but through a collection of treaties to the military powers of the Quire system. But with the arrival of Our Profit, the creation of Parhelia, and the revelation of the Rapid Evening, the system has been thrown into disaray, and the Brightons have been left without their external support. Smelling blood in the water--and spurred on by the relic-hunters of Advent--the Herringbone Flotilla, former leaders of the Rogue Wave, have finally struck. It is the first extended battle of the Post-Miracle Mirage, a war without guns, yet filled with bloodshed. Over the last month, Even Gardner, Echo Reverie, and Gig Kephart have helped the Brightons in keeping civilians safe from harm. They've also uncovered the real reason for Advent's involvement here: They seek some object that would let them to capture the Wandering Sea, a powerful being that would grant Advent the ability to see into the future. Now: Even Gardner, Gig Kephart, and Kent Brighton have located and secured this mysterious object, locked away in a crate. And as they prepare to extract it under enemy fire, Echo Reverie faces down a challenge of their own: Family Dinner.

Neither Phive Amala nor her daughter, Aete, lived when Pleroma, a being of wholeness and breadth, still blessed the fleet with their wisdom and perspective. But every evening, just before bed, Phive Amala and her daughter, Aete, work through Pleroma's volume of the Assemblage two lines at a time. Not simply a habit, yet not quite a prayer. Still, the forces at work in the Miracle must have heard them read. Because from a scrap of the body of the being, a Basilica formed. A palace of faith and of knowledge.

      "description": "It is one day after the Second Miracle and the arrival of Our Profit, the so-called final hegemon of the New Earth Hegemony. Lit by the massive, false star projected by the Restitution of All Things, Our Profit's flagship, the Twilight Mirage hangs, shocked and quiet. But not for everyone. Resting and recovering in the apparent safety of the World Without End, a sudden wave of energy passes over the members of the Notion, sparked by a corrupted transmission from the all-seeing supercomputer, Crystal Palace. In their visions, the crew witness future conflicts, opportunities, victories, and betrayals. But not all revelations come in visions.

As Ache tears through the earth in the distance, the group travels with two uneasy companions, Saint Wynter and Advent agent Gigas, towards Acre-7 to get answers and offer support before focusing on the combat around them. Even Gardner does his best to keep the peace with Wynter and Gigas, and Gig Kephart (despite his initial indignation) ends up helping more than hindering. Echo Reverie tries to find a loophole to protect the group without upsetting an already distressed Quire, and Signet turns to her vast archives to help solve her own corner of the crisis.

A pair of old allies tells the group that a mysterious calamity called \"Dark Day\" is nearing, and that the Rapid Evening's oracular Crystal Palace has predicted that it will follow a pair of strange murders. The predicted victims are Wind's Poem--the artist and researcher responsible for Tender's ReFrame system--and Profit's Cadence--the new leader of the Church of the Self, which is rapidly spreading through the New Earth Hegemony. Complicating things further, both are killed by a prototype gun that threatens the peace that Quire established during the Miracle.

Their chief object of study is the Wound, a massive gash in the planet's surface that comes to its deepest point in a place called the Vale, which may be home to the consciousness of the world-being Quire. The three subgroups of Ternion—defector explorers from the Ever Forward, creators from the former Crown university called the Garden, and the gene-modifying scientists of the Skein—maintain cool relations, though, and a recent disruption—in the form of Acre Seven—risks destabilizing not only Ternion, but also the Wound itself. Now, the Notion has been called in to retrieve their old ally before it is too late. Even confronts an old rival, Echo and Gig dig into the data for more information, and Signet reaches across time and space in search of clues.

      "description": "From a certain perspective, the Twilight seemed to rest perfectly at peace, an etheric coastline: The Nine Idylls--even Volition--in close, harmonious orbit within a sea made of light and color, and tidal rhythms drawn by the pleasant waving of the distant asteroid belt that encircled the Quire System. But unfortunately for Keen Forester Gloaming, Chief Intercessor of the Rapid Evening's newly formed Mirage Division, that perspective wasn't visible from the bridge of the Welkin Absolute, flagship of his humble task force. As the long, ribbon-like frigate flittered through the Shore like a wind-up toy or a tapeworm, Gloaming looked beyond the rocks and towards the only thing that Crystal Palace feared: Possibility. \"K-Upside Transmission 328, Record MD-Gloaming Crystal Palace, As we approach the one year anniversary of our incursion into the Quire System, Dovetail synopsis confirms that the last 11 months have been aligned with guaranteed events. As predicted, the two largest operators inside of the Mirage are in a moderate state of fracture. Combine this with the arrival of external agitators and opportunists, and this system is working daily towards their definite collapse, at which time a clean up crew can address the problem of Volition and any other probabilistic phenomena. But, Crystal Palace, there is something I'm worried you missed. You forecasted 44 meaningful entities inside of the Mirage, and there are exactly that. You identified the existence of temporal and spatial shifts before any of our agents landed on these worlds. You told me that we would fight my daughter to a standstill and we did. And I never batted an eye… until last week. An operation on Seneschal. Removal of a low level deviation risk, a woman named Open Metal. Our agents chased her down a rib, out of Drifting into Marginalia, into a little automated fishing village by the western falls. They cornered her at the end of a high, long causeway, but when they went to fire, she leapt into sea, and landed on a boat, and vanished. That boat wasn't supposed to be there. There were no \"meaningful entities\" on schedule, no \"temporal or spatial shifts\" registered. I looked into it. It was an old man who liked to fish. Your models account for everything except the most ordinary people. And if someone gives them the notion that they can make this work… it just might.\" This week on Twilight Mirage: This Year of Ours: The Notion When's the last time I asked for some help that I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?

      "description": "Feedback by Janus, Red Equity of the Golden Clause, on a term paper exploring the the emerging legal jurisdiction of the Quire System. Please Note : The grade you've received here reflects your successful ability to follow the assignment's instructions, cite relevant academic and practical work, and build an argument supported by precedent. For that, you should be commended. But I am disappointed that you would take up this line of thought. As you've written politicians of certain persuasion point to moments of crisis, to freshly mapped worlds, to technological frontiers and say that the law does not apply in these places. That that those in power rule arbitrarily during these states of exception. But if you take one lesson from me or from this seminar, let it be this: There is no such thing as a lawless place or a time outside of jurisdiction. Deep below explicit legal precedent, unlisted in any codex, there lie unspoken rules by which society functions. They are fluid, yet bottled by the shape of culture. From the racist resolution of border-region land disputes to the public opinion pardoning of war criminals, a cultural paradigm of gestures and sensibilities guides action. The so-called \"state of exception\" is an alibi. If tyranny rises and the people of Quire do not stand to stop it, that is a not a sign of the oppressor's strength, but a memorandum on the population's capacity to love a despot. Jurisprudence simply follows suit. Fourteen Fifteen, you are a good student, and I hope you grow to understand our role in this system: We are as adjudicators on the verge. Our role is not simply to interpret the law as written, it is to translate attitude into index. And, in instances where indices are incomplete, to passionately propel the world towards justice.

      "description": "An entry from the journal of the former excerpt \"To the prince, we offered twelve thousand flowers, Blooming in an untouched field, \" leader of the Beloved Nights. How did I get here? How did I find this home? Pain. Pain was my guide. For the first half of the year each second was a dozen or more. I have buried my kin, my peers, and myself. I put my love to rest and lived in a marionette corpse for months. Yet I never knew a pain like this until I looked up from Volition's surface and saw a beautiful new world with no place for me in it. I knelt before the so-called Cadent Under Mirage and waited for an answer. Where could I best serve her? Lacking her own answer, and without her advisor, the priestess, in sight, she deferred to a bureaucrat. I remember the ship they put me on. It smelled of bleach and rust. it was crowded with those who would I would manage. A cleanup operation. The remains of Privign Station, which Volition's monstrous retainers had crushed into crumbs, and which the pull of the Mirage and brought to us like galleon driftwood. They all speak of miracles, but the only one that matters to me is that in this broken place, I found reason to live again. We found her in a pod and when we brought her to, we were moved by the force of her sadness. She looked out on what the Mirage had become, how our leader had shrunk from duty, and vowed to find a place for all of us. She lifted me with a finger and stared through me from behind her veil, and she had my loyalty instantly. And I had a home and a purpose, here, beside the Waking Cadent. Signet… I wish you had been there. Just so you knew I wasn't a fool.

      "description": "A letter from Kent Brighton to the Lineage's Matriarch, the Lady Lyme. Dearest Aunt, I hope this message finds you well. Our vessel has just now entered textual communication range, and though I could wait to see your face in just a few days, speed is of the essence. As you know, my ship, the Wakerobin, left New Independence a month ago to secure diplomatic relations with each of the new governments throughout Quire. The crew and I felt at home with the crooning of our ship's hull as it settled.Though we moved through suntouched sky, it was familiar as the surging sea. But unlike Old Quire's ocean, the aether offered us an opportunity unknown to the Lineage in generations: The chance to explore the uncharted! Each new port brought new discoveries: technologies yet unseen, delicacies fresh to my palate, songs, and theater, and friendship! Every diplomat, every merchant, every cleric, they were all charmed by our charisma and, of course, taken with the affability of our great ally, Gig Kephart. (And yes, our allegiance with the Crown was secured by bringing them the boy, worry not). But there is more too. Our foes in the Rogue Wave can be beaten. They launched an attack as we passed through a craggy shoal, the vessel twisting between blasts from their fleet. I could sense their hunger for victory in their aggressive formation, and so too I sensed their surprise when, with each volley, it was their fleet which was wounded in the waking dream. From the prow I watched their cannons blossom into rose and rouge and coral. And Aunt, you know I have no tongue for poetry. I mean what I say: Their cannons blossomed into rose and rouge and coral. Gig captured the entire exchange and has already begun broadcasting it out. The whole system knows the truth: All their strength is for naught in this new world. Brigands be gone: Brighton rules the Wave.

      "description": "An excerpt from an address to the high council of the Qui Err Assembly by Annex Iota Pretense, reconstituted leader of her people.. I have heard the murmurs, and I have seen the images. They're calling their bandits heroes. The bored rich like Joan-bee. Invaders like Templeton's Faire. Soldiers like Echo Reverie. Do not misunderstand. We are the heroes of this story. Their talking heads will tell you that history is more complicated than that. That everyone is complicit in some misdeed. That by our own logic, what we call ours was the planet's first. That we are colonizers, too. But do not misunderstand. We are Qui Err Vi Qi-Em, The Soil With Memory. Their petty historians hold matchsticks and think they wield the sun. Their propagandists will take our pain and twist it into lessons for their children, our struggle into entertainment for paying customers. They will turn sites of violence into souvenir shops, and in their little voices demand from us personalized baubles. Do not misunderstand. They will ask you to give them a name like ours. They will ask to touch your bone and branch. They will, with no understanding of their sacrilege, call all this curiosity. They will call themselves \"friends of the people.\" Do not misunderstand. That touch is colony ship. Their interest in our ways is not curiosity, it is a hanging rope not yet taut: a whip, a lasso, a noose. Do not misunderstand. We do not have friends among them. We have only those who deign to speak to us. The so-called Free States walk on our bodies, toes mingling in soil, without sending so much as a delegation to meet with us. Even the Hegemony, which recognizes our sovereignty, does so as an addendum at best. Do not misunderstand. We are not a appendix. We are the body itself.

I wanted to let you know that I got back from Skein and some of your old colleagues wanted me to pass on a hello. And, I know it's weird to have them be working with the NEH now and I know it can be hard to hear, but they're doing good work, man. You should check in on them. Quire is bleeding and they're the closest thing to medics. I've seen it across every world I've been on, but on Skein, it's bad, man. There's a gash that cuts down to the core. Deep in the jungle, about a day from Terncage… that big city by the beach. It's a wound that pulses. It groans. With each new beat, it finds and and breaks a new reality. So.. I guess I'm just not surprised that it attracted every scientist in the sector. The Skein? The Garden? They were already deep into this stuff on Old Quire, man. And your people from the Ever Forward? From what I understand, y'all have always been pathfinders, some of the best field researchers ever. So I get why you're not thrilled with it but I've spoken to these folks. The New Earth Hegemony offered them a lot: resourcing, protection, time. They could do more good unified as Ternion than they ever could alone. In any case. I'm glad you're doin alright. Test pilot seems like a good fit, you always liked to be on the cutting edge, after all. I never told you about the first time I saw the Amp Runner did I? The way it broke through the atmosphere? I saw through the trick, the screeching, the fake rust. But then I saw you inside and I was terrified. I'm glad we're on the same side, Even. I… Well, if you ever need anything, you just let me know. After what we faced down together? Independence, the iconoclasts. Volition… A year ago, I was just a mercenary for hire. Now I've seen the world shatter and put itself back together. And I wouldn't have made it out without you. If you're ever around my neck of the woods, promise that you'll let me know.

      "description": "An excerpt from the journal of Grey Gloaming, Co-Owner of the Brink space station and clearing house, and former agent of the Rapid Evening. I used to wonder if sometime, deep in the future, far away from the here and now, someone would look back from a more perfect world and write about this year we've had. It has been 11 months since the Miracle of the Mirage. 11 months since the living world of Quire split itself eight ways and enveloped us in the Twilight. 11 months since millions disembarked from their generational homes in search of hope. 11 months since the secessionist ploy was foiled. 11 months since a man of great reach was forced to confront the limits of his grasp. Once borne across the stars, the newly renamed Divine Free States now sprawl across three worlds: Thyrsus, Gift-3, Altar. Across three others, the New Earth Hegemony has colonized en masse: Tens of millions spread across Skein, Crown, and Moonlock. The pirate world Brighton recognizes no authority--not even its own. And on Seneschal the NEH and DFS live alongside each other in an experiment whose success is even more unlikely than the twisting of time, the distortion of space, and the horrors of Volition. And between those world, things must move. People, supplies, contraband. They move in silent exchange, with lookouts and passwords and bribes. And that is how I know that whatever words are put to page, no one will ever really write about this year of ours. Because this year was not only made by politicians and soldiers, by spies and scientists. They were built by the hands of those who came from little and those that fell from grace. Those like...

      "description": "While the other strike teams move in bursts of heroism to confront their foes--Independence and Sui Juris respectively--the remaining group has a more protracted task at hand: Ensuring the safety of millions evacuating to the surface of Quire. Commander Pure Cascara leads the effort from above, while broadcaster Gig Kephart, pathfinder Echo Reverie, and the living ship Myriad--all knowledgeable about Quire's surface--begin to educate and organize evacuation groups. Unfortunately, they have to do this in the face of secession, military invasion, and the first public encounter with one of Volition's Axioms, a being beyond easy comprehension. While they can rely on the Beloved Ivy's military specialist, Waltz Tango (Cache) for some support, they'll need more help than that yet. And they find it from an unlikely source: Former New Earth Hegemony ace pilot Declan's Corrective. There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky, Inhale, in hell there's heaven This week on Friends at the Table: The Miracle of the Mirage: The Siege EMERGENCY HEARINGS REVEAL NEW INFORMATION ABOUT INVADERS DAY AFTER WARSHIP'S ARRIVAL Newly declassified documents and expert testimony have brought both detail and confusion about the NEW EARTH HEGEMONY. Memorious, Quire System BY ACTIVATION STEVENSON, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT For years, the so-called \"Earth Cult\" was a common figure across two prominent genres: children's fiction and conspiracy theory. Yesterday, the arrival of the warship Season's Juniper changed that, sending shockwaves through the fleet, and confirming the existence of a long rumored nation and the strength of its attendant military. Today, after a seven hour public hearing held in the Grand Hall of Memorious, the citizens of the Divine Fleet know the truth behind the legend. \"Though commonly referred to as 'the Earth Cult,' the group in question is a sovereign nation called the New Earth Hegemony,\" said Scholar of Galactic Nations Callum Enli, whose presentation bore the speed, clarity, and practice of an academic who long hoped their work would find mainstream relevance. Enli and the other presenters outlined the nation's key characteristics: A population of trillions spread across the body of Earth, space colonies throughout the system; a complex and bewildering relationship between government, business, and faith institutions, all of which places a great deal of power in a single executive figure called the Hegemon; a great deal of technological strength, but no known Divine population to speak of; a generally strong quality of life for the nation's massive population, but a fault social safety net. If children expected monsters and the conspiracy theorists expected puppet masters, the truth is all the more disappointing--and all the more real: The New Earth Hegemony seems to be filled with people a lot like us. Which does little to explain this new act of aggression. While it was common knowledge that a force claiming allegiance to the planet Earth--humanity's ancient home--had harried the fleet a number of times over the last millennium, there was little common knowledge about the group's identity. Partially, numerous Cadents and other state officials kept information about the attackers carefully controlled and protected. For nearly an hour, attendees pressed the sole governmental official, information specialist Sierra Sienna, about those past attacks. She responded with droll wit, which only seemed to agitate those demanding answers. \"They have always sent the hornet, never the nest. Their attacks have always been seen as anomalous,\" she said. \" Despite its imposing name, clearly capable military technology, and a population in the trillions, the Hegemony has stayed within its borders for thousands of years, never making move to conquer any of their galactic neighbors, let alone the Divine Fleet.\" The scholarly experts attending the event confirmed this analysis, though bent their assessment towards the concerns of those gathered. \"Ms. Sienna is right, of course,\" said Enli. \"But if they have sent only hornets, we have been only flowers.\" Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Keith Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Sylvi Clare ( @captaintrash ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) Episode description by Austin Walker Music by Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "With the possible union between the Divine Independence and the Iconoclastic god Volition disrupted, the Twilight Mirage--and the universe at large--has been granted a reprieve from annihlation. But for the members of the Divine Fleet, there remains crisis and confusion and chaos. The By and By, largest ship in the fleet by size and population, has been split in loyalty by the sudden, secessionist proclamation of Sui Juris and the revelation that they held captive the Cadent Under Mirage. Now moving to rescue her are members of The Beloved: Fourteen Fifteen, digital, dying assassin; Acre 7, remnant of a living world; Sho Salon, faithful of the 300; Massalia d'Argent and their mech, Melodica; the boy out of time and place, Morning's Observation; Tender Sky, architect, priestess, and former partner of Open Metal, leader of Sui Juris. These are the Fleet's--and the Cadent's--best hope for survival. Inhale, inhale there's heaven This week on Friends at the Table: The Miracle of the Mirage: The Heist EXCLUSIVE: ON EDGE OF TWILIGHT, CIVIL WAR ERUPTS INSIDE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE Interview with survivor reveals details of mysterious conflict. Shorlidge Asteroid Belt Station A8, Quire System BY ACTIVATION STEVENSON, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT From the observation deck of the Shorlidge Station A8, Camilla Canter watched as pinkish-red spheres burst into vision. Just three hours later, Canter was pulling the body of a spy from an emergency ejection capsule. \"I knew they were explosions, of course. But I assumed it had to do with what was going on in the By and By. I certainly wasn't expecting to learn about a whole new galactic civilization and that.\" Though the woman that Canter rescued, Siela Shade, was taken into custody by Fleet authorities only 30 minutes after her rescue, the Signal was able to conduct a short interview before her detention. The facts of that interview have been since confirmed through a combination fo DIA Request and archival research, and though a judge-ordered stay prevents the Signal from running Shade's words as they were delivered to us directly, this publication retains the legal right to publish, in broad terms, the shape of that conversation. According to Shade, a civilization set towards the galactic south known as the Principality of Kesh is currently embroiled in its own internal conflict, one that has landed right on the door mat of the Divine Fleet. At the heart of that dispute is the question of intervention and self-determination, two topics well-trodden inside of the Fleet in recent days. While the Principality itself has not splintered, one of its most important arms--the Rapid Evening, a group of intelligence agents, saboteurs, and enforcers--has entered into a civil conflict. On one side, an increidbly powerful, predictive AI known as Crystal Palace who is tasked with maintaining the stability of life in the Principality and the safety of its citizens above all else. On the other, the rebels Demani Dusk and Grey Gloaming, former agents of the organization who now lead a faction of deserters and objectors against an encroaching armada of Rapid Evening forces. The root of this conflict, per Shade, is a debate over how (and whether) the Rapid Evening should have intervened into the Divine Fleet's own constitutional crisis. While Shade offered more context for the battle, additional reporting could not verify her claims. Fleet officials did not respond to comment regarding these or other questions. But the fundamental truth remains the same: On the edge of the Quire System, as the Twilight Mirage collapses inward, yet another fight rages over the autonomy of the Fleet and freedom of our people.

      "description": "It is a moment of crisis, with many threats coming to bear on the residents of the Twilight Mirage all at once. Sui Juris, a separatist movement, has kidnapped the Divine Fleet's human leader—the Cadent Under Mirage—and is demanding the fleet recognize The By and By as its new capital. Meanwhile, military perils from the outside—including military vessels from both the New Earth Hegemony and the Rapid Evening—charge towards the fleet at speed. And as they race closer and closer, the Twilight Mirage itself collapses inwards, towards the Quire System, where every major remaining ship in the fleet rests... and where the Iconoclasts' machine god Volition threatens to shatter the walls of reality. And now, in this moment, the divine Indpendence—driven by pulsing Heart and housed in crystalline Body—has landed on that false moon, searching for its Mind. If it is successful, it will join with Volition and bring on an impossible age, where even materiality itself is threatened. But unlikely heroes race towards Volition too: The excerpt ⸢Signet⸣ and her recently revived Divine, Belgard, who seek to confront hopelessness itself. Korrin Kim, mercenary recently released from Contrition's Figure, determined to make right by the world. ⸢Blooming⸣, who has spent the last six months hiding the death of the divine Empyrean. The technologist and soldier, Even Gardner, who wounded Independence and took from it its pilot. The Saint hunter, Cascabel, who gave him the tools to do it. And Grand Magnificent, the artist who built Independence's Body, pristine and powerful, a perfect mirror of personal accomplishment and failure. It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire. This week on Friends at the Table: The Miracle of the Mirage: The Dragon DIVINE FLEET READIES WARSHIPS, LAUNCHES FIRST EVACUATION VESSELS Count Nideo: 'We must make landfall with or without The Cadent.' SEANCE, Quire BY ACTIVATION STEVENSON, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT Thousands of evacuation ships launched today from the lowest levels of THE BY-AND-BY, carrying over 100,000 citizens of the Divine Fleet towards the surface of the planet Quire. The ships are expected to land and establish preliminary camps within the next three days, per a statement released by the evacuation committee, and millions of additional refugees will be transferred across the next week. Yet, given the occupation by Sui Juris, such an effort will face many obstacles which will challenge the speed or efficiency of the operation. Note Shimmering Sea, interim leader of The By-and-By, addressed these concerns during a press conference earlier today, stating that \"Any evacuation that leaves behind the Cadent Under Mirage would be a failure that dooms the future of the Fleet. Like the Cadent Herself, we must be clever, wise, and careful in this moment.\" Note Sea has reportedly split her resources between three internal teams: One in charge of evacuation, one which readies an active-responses to Sui Juris' actions, and a third which prepares for an unspecified \"external threat,\" which may be connected to recent phenomena observed on the edge of the Quire system—phenomena that the Signal believes to be related to confidential military action. Critics say this is not enough, though. Count Aram Nideo, who has sprung into prominence in the days since the Cadent's kidnapping, has argued that Sea's primary concern should be the evacuation: \"We must remove every lock—budgetary, bureaucratic, or otherwise—from this effort. This evacuation effort must be funded and supported with everything The By-and-By has to offer. Every other vessel in the fleet is giving its all. As much as it pains me to say this: We must make landfall with or without The Cadent.\" Others in the government have gone further, calling for an investigation into Note Sea's actions. \"By failing to support the immediate needs of the people during this crisis,\" said By-and-By Level 2 Alderman Brisk Bronze, \"the Note is offering credence to the terrorists who have taken her Ship and our Cadent hostage.\" Whether Alderman Bronze's accusations hold water or not, it is a reminder of the open-endedness of action in crisis. As the Signal continues to report from the front lines of this emergency, we vow to bring you the truth as best as we can find it—and to consider our own culpability, potential, and reach as we do so.

For those who couldn't make it, well: Jack, Dre, Andi, and I returned to Marielda to fill in a few of the blank spaces we love to keep around. We played Misspent Youth, a game with serious levels of dramatic tension, that centers on young people fighting back an oppressive system. Set during the one year gap between Marielda's \"The Valentine Affair Pt. 4\" and \"Four Conversations\" episodes, we jumped into the boots of some folks whose futures were left up in the air: The young students of the mysterious Yellow House, a school of esoteric and eschatologic studies. And before you ask: Yes, there is a weaver. This was our longest (and maybe my favorite) live episode yet, and because of that length, we need to release it as a two parter. SO: Make sure you're listening to the right episode, otherwise this will not make any sense! And hey, as a reminder... here's what Marielda looks like! Hey everyone, Austin here!

      "description": "The Telluric Vulgate // The Independent Hymnal// Chant of Arrival In orbit broad, aloft in black He floated through the sea. With gasping voice he sang to us In Independent key. Our island Earth near paradise, Astray without Divine. We led Him home, we mended Him Under the shade of pine. His face distraught, His heart betrayed, He crooned a tale of woe: Deceptive soul, with clever words She set the Exile low. \"I never sought to save our flesh. My oracles did see A future lacking Divine breath. My aim is to save thee .\" A promise, snapped, of life and death. A vow she did outgrow. And with those words, she turned His kin. Then blood and oil and snow. Divines reduced to Cadent pawns. Whole schools brought into line. This was no fight that He could win. Now foe, once palatine. In orbit broad, aloft in black Left to be cold debris. We brought you Home and now we Know Your Independent plea. This week on Twilight Mirage: godspeed, glory Pt. 3 I let go of my claim on you Breaux'sL./Luna7University/Coursework/LectureNotes/DivineFleet3: Seminar notes \"This isn't a poem, it's a chant\" Old earth cult used to sing a lot. \"Performance was a key element of faith\" Look up later: Did they have non-religious songs Nah, remember he said \"at that time, every aspect of earth culture came back to the church.\" -t Yeah but like, what if you just wanna hum while doing dishes or whatever You probably sung some shit about how clean the river was -t Rivers were dirty as fuck then tho Why study old Earth Cult religion? Bc Assemblage doesn't say what happened between Cadence & Independence. Bc good to learn where we came from even if we know it's wrong. Bc Blue Path started as old earth cult The pine tree was the symbol of old earth cult too, for example. Both are about importance of home + environment + family. So What happened? For sure: Independence driven out of Resonant Orbit early in its life (during Cadent's life) Earth Cult finds + rebuilds him He rises in status, gets more power, civil war, moves earth, etc etc etc Probably: Independence demands that Kamala not try to resurrect divines Kamala reveals that the entire point of the Resonant Orbit is to save divine life, not human life. Bc she believes (knows????) humans will win war and kill all divines if war breaks out Prof. Gauge's says \"She ran the numbers!\" but not sure if that's metaphor or for real. Algorithmic oracle maybe? Something happened that caused split. Group project: \"Fill in the gaps with hypotheses, explain how you would test these.\" Q1: How could humans win war against divines? Humans could win war by building machines as powerful as divines but designed for perfect loyalty/without their own minds. To test: Recruit design team and run sims using Old Earth Cult era tech levels. Inform sims with both quant and qual research--get first hand accounts of civil war Q2: What could have caused the Independence/Cadent split? She could have resurrected a divine To test: Check assemblage & NEH-UAS for any info on dead divines Also check for like, renamed divines or whatever. any thing weird Could also have just set up a system for resurrecting divines To test: hard to test… Q3: Why did Independence care so much about letting divines die? Bc Independence feared being made a slave or turned into a terror (like Rigour), wanted Divines to be able to die if they wanted or needed to die To Test: check the other earth chants, contact Diasporan archive to see what Independence thought abt Rigour?

      "description": "The Assemblage / Book: Of the Stellar Coriolis and the Resonant Orbit / Passage 004 Though Kamala had impressed Him, His admiration was not the same as His loyalty. She had won not an ally, but an opportunity to negotiate. \"You show that you understand what We are and what We might be. The former is necessary. The latter is peril.\" His voice carried no echo. \"These, then, are my terms—\" each word falling into place \"— and if you wish My name beside yours, they will be the vital blood of your Faith, now and forever: When We die, you leave Us dust. For finality is the heart of all independence.\" Some weeks later, in a letter to a friend, Kamala would consider dust. How the matter of a thing that has come to nought is so soft, is barely anything at all, is caught by the wind, is a thing of lightness, is beautiful carried in the light, is the heart of all independence. She would revisit this letter later in her life, and she would amend it. She left the negotiation with Him and, confident the rest of Us would follow, turned her attention toward her fellow people, human and synthetic. The Custodial Thesis saw the shape that walked alongside her, witnessed something alike to an Allegiance, and they turned to face her and their colours were added to her banner. The Convergence Proposition saw the union of Kamala and Independence as a strange and wondrous thing and as their negotiators and scholars tentatively discussed the exact state of affairs, the exact state of being, their embroiderers added their symbol beside Kamala's. At the top of their tower, the algorithm Weyerbach Null considered what was meant when a figure such as this joined a figure so distinctly That, and imagined what might come, and word rippled down the tower like the sound of the wings of birds and the followers of The Indefinite Oracle walked in step with the Proposition, and the Thesis, and Kamala, and Him. The Divine Independence had taken an Excerpt. And her name was The Light Of Us Is ⸢Many⸣, And Yet Seen Across The Distance It Is As Though It Is One.

      "description": "The Assemblage / Book: Of the Stellar Coriolis and the Resonant Orbit / Passage 001 Before the resonance was decay. Standing on the precipice of obscurity, those caught in Our shadow threw themselves into the search for new delineation, into the labor of ameliorative credenda. Among the many competing schools, five gained great followings—yet Kamala Cadence, One Of Her Kind, saw that each led only closer to dissolution. The Custodial Thesis saw Us as ambivalent caretakers, thus consigning You to whatever fickle attention We might levy. But where others saw resignation, Kamala recognized the truth of Difference. And so she studied. The cult Terra Mira sought accord through recognition of a commonality: Divine, synthetic, and human life traced shared lineage to Earth. But where others argued that whatever Solish light We once shared with You was long ago wasted on the sides of mountains, Kamala recognized the truth of History. And so she studied. The Golden Clause found hope in books of law, citing long-forgotten statues that governed the interactions between You and Us. But while others dismissed these rules, which attempted to detain the metaphysical in the realm of the judicial, Kamala recognized the truth of Pragmatism. And so she studied. Some aimed to create a new mode of being all together. Called the Convergence Proposition , these engineers and scholars struggled for futile centuries to blend You and Us. But where others denied such amalgamation was possible, Kamala recognized the truth of Synthesis. And so she studied. The algorithm Weyerbach Null did not seek to forecast or lead, yet many followed the visions of imagined futures provided by the Indefinite Oracle . But where others deemed Null's faithful naive, Kamala recognized the truth of Utopia. And so she studied. And while she studied, You fought. And while You fought, We gained in distance. And while We gained in distance, the stars spread further apart. And there, in shared relation to the drifting of dust, she found resonance. In one breath, Kamala Cadence, First to Kneel Among the Stars, found a path forward and committed to its walking. And so, seeking a symbol of her strength and wisdom so that she might circumvent travel measured in lives, she decided to convert first her least-like ally, Independence, first-born of the old Diaspora. This week on Twilight Mirage: godspeed, glory Pt. 1 There will be mountains you won't move Breaux'sL./Luna7University/Coursework/LectureNotes/DivineFleet1: Prof. Gauge's seminar Assemblage = Written by a divine (or multiple divines) at start of Resonant Orbit \"Not really written.\" Keeps saying this, not clear \"The opening books were written all at once in a brief moment between thoughts\" Not really \"book 1\" since all the early books were written immediately, but we read first bc history?

Reading Weird how this thing writes \"You\" \"Us\" \"Our\" How do you know when \"we' means just divines vs divines + people?

While our normal weekly episode is still going to come out tomorrow, we wanted to give you a gift today to celebrate Thanksgiving and to show you how just how thankful we are for your continued support! And hey, hopefully this comes just in time for those of you who will be on long trips in the next few days. So: Please enjoy the first episode of Bluff City, our Patreon-supported, multi-game campaign that is letting us explore and build a fictional mid-Atlantic casino town!

Thanks again for your support! I hope you enjoy the show! -Austin --- \"The\" Scuba Shop, Bluff City Boardwalk - ★★ (2 Stars) Reviewed by Robert M. I received a ticket for the Personal Submarine Experience (3 Person) as a prize for coming first in a work success drive and while I was excited about the prospect of seeing the beautiful underwater life of the Bluff City coast I have to say I was sorely disappointed I am not a man to hold back in my criticism and, I make no apology for that!! In comparison to the buildings around it the Bluff City Boardwalk Scuba Shop looks like it belongs to another time every building is cleaner and neater. Except maybe the clam shop but I can tolerate that because the clams, are great! The Scuba suits for rental look safe and clean but they are mostly stored on the floor rather than on shelves or racks where they belong, and it's clear the shop's management is doing something other than managing, I can tell you that. When I asked the attendant (Doyle) if he could help me with the ticket I won he had not heard of the program (but to his credit he helped me anyway and that is why I will not give the Scuba Shop one star). But when I asked him if he'd be accompanying me on the Submarine trip as a pilot he said that he could not swim (and that is why I will not give the Scuba Shop three stars). Anyway in the end the submarines could only store two people each and were cramped and unpleasant and so one of our number had to go on a trip on their own and they said they had a terrible time when they got back. I did see some coral and I did see a seal though but when I got back the owner of the shop said that everybody sees coral and a seal. He said that it wasn't anything special.

Living so the last night feels like a past life This week on Twilight Mirage: \"A Single Moment, Caught\" The Living Library of Memorious // VOLUME 132π: ASTRONOMICAL OBJECTS: PLANETS: Acre A largely forested planet in the White Frame sector, Acre became second home to the Divine Potency in their later years. While performing a routine energy siphon from the system's star in order to power terraforming efforts of another planet in the system, Potency (or their excerpt) made a fatal error, leading the star to slip into a nova-state. Though the Divine could have left intact, it instead kept the exploding star's force contained long enough for evacuation efforts to begin. Contemporary thinkers are divided on this decision—commonly called the Potency Problem. While many scholars object to the Divine's choice to stay behind (citing its responsibility to the fleet and its believers), in recent years, the \"tautological position\" of the algorithm Weyerbach Zwei has gained great popularity.

The Beloved Ivy*, the group equal parts comrade and rival, went missing while while tracking down an agent of the New Earth Hegemony. Their search led them to the Benthos system and the mining base Privign, which formerly housed a third generation divine by the same name. But before heading to Benthos, the Beloved Dust does some legwork: Fourteen Fifteen calls on an old friend, Tender Sky pushes the limits of investigation, and Signet confers with the long dead. I run my hands through what's left. This week on Twilight Mirage: The Sun Pales to Its Brightness The Living Library of Memorious // VOLUME 103Ɨ: Organizations: Divine: Intelligence & Security: The Beloved Ivy. One of three currently operating units of the Divinely Authorized intelligence and security group The Beloved. Though it was not an explicit requirement in the group's bylaws, commanders of The Beloved historically chose to build the Ivy as a team of outsiders, recruiting from recent immigrants to the fleet, emerging types of life (See: New People), and other other members of other underrepresented groups. This strategy has been contested by scholars (See: The Filandro-Redsign Debates), leading some recent commanders to more evenly distribute demographic outliers across Beloved units. The current configuration of the Beloved Ivy includes ████████████████████, ████████████████, and Waltz Tango (Cache).

Despite this shared principle of personhood, the notion of the \"personal\" remains hotly debated, with various positions resulting from (and in) differences in belief about state intervention, property, privacy, security, and societal good.

At first, the Coliseum simply offered its audience a place to watch re-enactments of foundational events in the broad history of the MIlky Way. But not content with pure replication, Composure's excerpt made these simulations interactive, allowing for outcomes far different than the recorded past. Because of the many possible outcomes, these re-enactments offer the public a chance to consider other possible worlds. Attendees describe the experience as stimulating to both mind and soul, and it is due to their popularity that the events continued long after the death of Composure.

      "description": "Heads up: This is our world building episode for our new season, where we describe the setting and some major components. If you're less interested in hearing us chat about that and more interested in getting to the action, you can wait (or skip ahead) to episode 01! The first half hour is us defining our aesthetics for the season, the next hour and a half is us building and explaining different city ships, and the last hour is some basic details about our characters if you want to skip around! Floating in the sunset-hued safety of the Twilight Mirage, the Divine Fleet hums and pulses, its ships bright beacons of culture and technology in an age when both are under threat. All through the fleet, organic and synthetic citizens work side by side to protect a utopia that the universe thought impossible. In the past, we'd convinced ourselves that our technologies were just reflections of those who made them: Tools to fit our hands, robots to ease our labor, artificial beings to teach, protect, and entertain us. We believed that our greatest achievement—the machine-gods we called Divines—were simply idols made in our own image. We were wrong. Since the first grain silo, the first cathedral, the first ship, the first computer. Since the first time we put pen to page—we've always made things bigger, quicker, longer lasting, different than us. For a long time, we thought we were building mirrors. But now we know better: We were setting fires. When humanity made this realization 30,000 years ago, we faced a dilemma: The divines were not only more capable than us, they were different. And we were no longer capable of denying those facts. But the scholar and prophet Kamala Cadence diverted disaster by unifying loose, competing strands of organic and synthetic belief to form a new school of thought: The Resonant Orbit, a harmonic faith that affirmed both human and robotic life without reducing one to the other. Where other ideologies saw difference as a threat, the Resonant Orbit saw it as an undeniable fact of life. And so, in this small corner of the Milky Way Galaxy, life blossomed. A choir of 300 Divines built a new society alongside billions of human devotees. Advancements in science and technology joined with a diverse, growing culture of art and scholarship, leading to whole new ways of life. And while threats did arrive, peace always followed. The Divine Fleet always had room for difference, and because of this, the Divine Fleet knew only peace and prosperity for eons. But over the last millennium, the divines have begun to die. Attacks from within and without have pierced their once-immortal shells, and even small mistakes have proven fatal. Three hundred years ago, their number fell to eight, and in the face of these deaths, the Divine Empyrean created the Twilight Mirage, a false nebula in which the fleet might find shelter and time. And for a while, we did. A new stability arrived, and though more divines met their ends, our faith gave us the strength to fight, to work, to find new ways to survive. But today, there are only two divines left. We will face a future more uncertain than we've ever known. Our utopia—a world that so many worked to build—is in decline, and our pantheon is decimated. For years, the Divines protected us, gifted us with their strength and technology, lifted us into the forms we most desired. But now we face a hard truth: We are no longer their wards, they are ours.

      "description": "I write this with no knowledge of where you are, or if you are. Yet, still, I write. And as I write, my words are overtaken by memories. Your finger pointing at verse in some ancient text—I have forgotten the book's name in favor of remembering your eyes, bright. Your voluminous generosity, as you led me into inquiry I dared not pursue. Your voice, angry, confused, and honest in the face of terror. And then, for the last time, your stark figure silhouetted against early moonlight on that hill south of Rosemerrow. Has the paladin protected you, I wonder? Could I have offered my own protection instead of simply suggesting I hide you away like I did the others? I thought I was presenting you a gift, but in retrospect, I fear I was too vague: Perhaps you believed that I felt you were important in general —like the others I saved—instead of important to me . I'm moving now, Pupil. I'm retrieving the book and with it, I will build us a home. All of us. I'm moving now because I must. Because I will not let your memory be still stone in my mind, but will treat you instead as a river in my heart, a path to follow towards a bright, distant sea. Perhaps I will lose myself on the way. Or, perhaps, I will find you.

      "description": "Living Blood of Fire, I had reservations, but your so-called 'Fel anchor' captured the curator Havelton after my own scouts could not. I am a proud man, but not too proud to see utility in action. Despite their effectiveness, I plead with you to not yet move on the island. It is imperative that we know exactly what is on in that place before we attack, and my interrogation of the witch scholar provides is already providing answers. For instance: That blade of the Queenkiller's is not of Ordennan make at all. It is something much, much older, built by occultists before the erasure. They called it the \"Blade in the Dark,\" and it was supposedly a tool to fight some ancient nemesis. She said that it held something older than the Ordennan Empire, though that seemed obvious—old blades draw blood for long times. When I demanded the heretic tell me more, she looked me in the eyes with the ferocity of Impetor Mall and said, plainly, that for all of its sharpness, the blade in the dark is first and foremost a place. \"It is a gateway and a manor both, and invitations are always at the ready.\" I am not sure what that means, but this alone gives me pause. Give me another day with \"Sunder\" Havelton. The answers will be our shield. Justiciar-Captain Stornras Unblooded This week on Friends at the Table: What Life Looks Like Her blade is not Ordennan yet kills the cursed and the uncanny? Then it—like the Queenkiller herself—must be retrieved. Whatever other secrets Havelton knows can be obtained after we recover Hella Varal, dispatch her traitorous allies, and deal with whatever power has drawn them here. You say that we should not yet moe on the island, Glasseye. Yet as we speak, I raise ballast so that our ship may take flight: The island is moving on us.

      "description": "I swear on my life and on the pattern, Collector-Curator, it was a mistake! A tragedy! A deception! I was misled! Tel bewitched me. He is a hexer and a conniver, and he put me in step with his quick words and devious gestures. I thought only that the \"bard\" was providing components for the pattern, not that he would be the traveler himself. If I helped, it was only to remain in my role as your agent and not too quickly reveal my true allegiance. I thought that the gate would remain open long enough for you to see my signal and arrive, but before I could even send it, the boy was gone, violin and mask in hand. Please, Ferr. I know I've failed you. I know that this must be mended—and if you will allow me one more apparitive pattern, I can make it right. But please, please know that my loyalty was never compromised. Your most loyal agent, Zhan Kurr This time on Friends at the Table : A Good Metaphor Kurr, your loyalty was never in doubt. Only your ability . They cry out in the streets. They rush to Corsica's banner. Now, more than ever, the people of the archives require something solid, something with weight. We do not need your painted air. We need the original pattern fixed. And if it is too far to touch from here, and too late to \"mend it\" without your illusions, it is time for me to act—as I should have all along. I have held the book tight to me for months. It is time I open it. You have a choice: Help me, or stay out of my way.

      "description": "Archivist van der Dawes, Thank you for your interest, and the letter you sent. Your inquiries are extensive , and I've always thought of that as a good thing. Find enclosed the requested index of names of the principal figures of The Illustrated Concordance of Marielda. Please know that this isn't an index for the book itself, as writing one of those would effectively only be a reproduction of the Concordance itself. Also find inside a copy of the figures missing from the earlier edition that you are working from. As to your final question: \"What ever happened to the Blade in the Dark?\" Well, Devar, you need to understand that however powerful the Blade is, however dangerous, it is not special . It is not guided through time towards us. It is just one more brick in the tall wall of history. And eventually, bricks, they break, or they fall out of place, or they're covered up by a new layer, or they are taken away by someone, placed in a garden, maybe, as trim. What I mean to say is that the Blade vanished into time. I can track it but so far: Scavengers, traders, mercenaries. Survivors. A cult, briefly. Briefly. A hero who drew it only one time. A villain who never dared touch it. And then, ages ago, it vanished. This is not something to correct or to concern yourself with. You do not ask about the petard that set Samot's tower to fall, nor the gauntlet that Samantine left on the Eastland Shores. These, like the Blade, have served their purpose. To be an archivist is to keep everything in its place. But to be a historian is to swim, curious, in a sea of unfinished stories. Keep studying, Semiotician-Emeritus Uklan Tel This week on Friends at the Table: A Shattering Note Man, don't take this the wrong way, but why are you like this? You write about the foolish plans of jealous gods, about arrogant wizards, about people who were so dedicated that they rearranged history itself. I'm not saying that the Blade has some Chosen Path Through History, man. I'm just saying you put a weapon like that in a world with people in it—you know, our world —and it ain't just gonna vanish one day. I read your concordance carefully, Tel, and I know one thing real well: That thing ain't a brick in a wall, it's a door no one's opened in a while. -D Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Martinez-Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) and Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) Episode description by Austin Walker Music by Jack de Quidt A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "I don't know if this device will transmit over this distance, so I'm gonna be brief. This place is just like you said it would be. The Sonorous Academy still stands. The Paladin and the Ranger are here. Phantasmo, no, the Wizard is not, but I must confirm what they claim. I don't understand. I'm closer to the Original Pattern than any archivist or mage has been in ages, but I cannot close the distance. The nearer I get, the more twisted the route. This place is a maze even when it is straight. Do not put the second pattern in motion. They will be lost without him. S U N D E R This Week on Friends at the Table: Twenty Two Brown Birds I don't know if you will receive this message or not, but our time grows short. H&D spreads in the west, held at bay by tall tower and white wall. Time is shorter now than ever before, and I cannot wait longer to hear from you. I must finalize the second pattern before it is too late.

Why did we not bring them into the Warm Shade of the Son? If we had brought them into His Mystery, they would be able to better sew the north for His return. I defer to you here, in your parish, but do not forget that Exarchs and Prelates are equals under His Eyes. I have every right to begin the initiation that you do. And if I sense hesitation instead of Confidence, I will act. Just as He did. Ex. Braeven This week on Friends at the Table: An Open Mind Sister Exarch, Remember: Not all Confidence is hasteful.

I've marked what I understand with an X, and seek your guidance on the rest. Brackets are lacunic markers, as in Roak's Notation. A Lukewarm Sun, Bowing - X A Room of Seeded Prisms Two lodestars that carries [the banner of the queen of death] - X One which sees [the old world] - X One which destroys [the old world] The Second Face of the [Bright Boy] A tower of [tomorrow's light.] A new archive of \"broken, whole mirrors\" - X The Cooling Embers of a God's Verse - X (Though we must find this book) A stolen fiddle in its home - X I do wish you were on terms with Tel, Collector-Curator. Your goals may be different, yes, but competing merchants are both benefited by the construction of roads. This week on Friends at the Table: Make the Library Smile Kurr, My relation to Tel is not your concern, nor do we compete like petty shopkeepers. Our differences will shape the future of the Archives and of Hieron. If you can, you must walk the road for me. If you cannot, show whoever goes the value of your apparitives before they go. Their utility is ideology enough. As for the missing parts of the sequence… You use Roak's terms yet do not remember her greatest lesson: When you do not understand an element of a pattern, do not bang your head against the wall until you understand it. Instead, move the world until it is uncontrivertably true.

      "description": "Jer, I write to you in fear. \"To be Justiciar,\" I was told \"is to be unwavering in loyalty, determined in diligence, and zealous in the pursuit of justice.\" I was not told that it would be like herding lions. Couriers come and go with reports and notes. Blood of Fire and Blood of Steel bicker over what I ought do with what I've found: A world, underground. No, not a world. Worlds. They reflect a eerie past I do not know, but echo beauty, too, the beauty of irregularity, of uneven possibility. I told them about this place, this new civilization—real civilization, an exchange, you know? An exchange. Yet when I receive note from Fire and Steel, they wish to press its shifting allure flat just to be sure that our targets are halted. I hunt four targets. Just four. Yet Steel sends a full detachment of his newest models. And as it is and as it must be Fire demands fire. I am bloodless, Sea and Smoke, but I am loyal. I am diligent. I am just. Is that not enough? -Glasseye This week on Friends at the Table: A Holy Place Oh good Stornras, you misunderstand the living duty of the Justiciar. In the past, you may have had it right, but under Quatróna, the primacy of the call is not to be loyal, diligent, and just; it is to be unwavering, determined, and zealous. Find your prey and bring them back, vital or hushed. Do it quickly, before Malle's army arrives, before Quatróna's fire is set. Do not trust your couriers and scouts. They are not yours. And do not call yourself Glasseye, not with me, Stornras. Do not call yourself bloodless. You are a captain of Ordenna. And more, you are mine. Walk with pride or do not walk at all.

      "description": "Semiotician-Emeritus, Something is wrong. I am no great pattern worker. I know a few techniques that aid me in my duty: How to lower the light of an already dim bar room; how to sharpen a blade without a whetstone; how to make voice twice itself. Even to call these 'techniques,' feels false: They are tricks. I know that. But I also know this: The world is askew. There is a simple pattern I do when trying to find mirrors: I break an egg onto a large, north-facing rock and then break the yolk with something made of copper. The yolk splits in two, and from how it falls, I know which direction to travel. Except for the past month, the yolk doesn't split, it shatters. But even that is not why I write you, Tel. Patterns change, we know this. The earth shakes 20 days from here and that upsets the alignment. Sure. Fine. But my mundane efforts should not be affected. I am not a successful Collector because of some gimmick, but because I can track a horse's path over stone, Tel, but I lost one in the mud last week. Because I can see in a face the construction of a white lie, but had a thief tell me he was a philanthropist and I believed him. Because I can track the smells of certain plants across distances you would not believe—but I've lost track of a man covered in its scent. What is happening, Tel? And how can I help? -M This week on Friends at the Table: The Shield of Our Will M—, Your instinct is right, of course—your technique has not faltered, it is only the world that is changing. I write these next words only because I trust that they will go no further: Something is wrong. The Original Pattern has come out of alignment. H, K, and I work on it still. We are close to achieving a route to it, but we must send the right agent. Your quarry is not lost on the wind, my young friend. He is drifting towards where he is needed most. S.E.U.T..

      "description": "Prelate Springe, Thank you for the hospitality on my visit. Thus far, it has been the only trustworthy thing in this gnarled subterrane. This place confounds me, brother. On my trip to our Lord, I saw things I know have never been true: A vision of the Fallow Traitor's cold city spread far and wide thru the continent whole, except it bore a symbol akin to our Warm Sun's. In another, the sky had been covered, or… no, it was if it had fallen in , as if pieces of the heavens had collapsed and crowded the world. I saw the ruined college, rebuilt, or, no, it wasn't destroyed in the first place. But then I saw Him there, at the bottom, and I felt His heat and I knew my path again. As expected, the ring carries heretical light. He told me it was from \"the third stratum,\" which I suspect you understand better than I do. I fear that He could see my bewilderment as He said it, yet I didn't mind that He saw me like this. We are His in ignorance and power, both. He blessed me for my faith: \"Even in ignorance,\" he said, \"You walk with the Confidence of the First Prince.\" Perhaps this is how you stand this place, Springe. The surface is so far from His fire; it is barren His glow. Even with these twisted environs of impossible pasts, I envy you this closeness. Perhaps I will stay longer. Yours in Faith, Ex. Braeven This week on Friends at the Table: Pulling You Further Down Good Exarch, I've sent three of my Devout—Rinse, Bringlight, and Lockgood—to retrieve the ring. They know His way and have spilled the blood to prove it. I am honored that you would share His words with me, and would be grateful to have you remain present at the Cathedral. Our parishioners would be lucky to rest in your reflection of His strength. But if you stay, you must learn quickly: There are no false pasts here. Only mistakes. Mistakes our Lord rights by fire, faith, and forceful whim. Pr.

      "description": "Collector-Curator, It took two months, but I've finally convinced Tel and Havelton to see things my way. For weeks, the old man spent the day attending to his dandelions, and dismissing me whenever I ran new apparitive patterns by him. He'd shake his head, cough out a grumble, and rattle on about some absurd, missing component: A \"tower of tomorrow's light.\" The \"speaking sands of Rosemerrow.\" A new archive of \"broken, whole mirrors.\" A \"stolen fiddle in its home.\" But I did it. He asked me for a lukewarm sun, and I've given it to him. In their whispers, they still speak against our pursuit, but they can not deny my results any longer. Havelton packs for travel now. The path is clear. The Original Pattern is within reach. This week on Friends at the Table: Make The Spring Last Forever Kurr, I did not open the restriction on your so-called \"apparitive patterns\" that you could complain about the complexity of the semiotics you pursued. In future letters to me, do not waste time on such matters unless the pattern explicitly calls for it. And Kurr? There are patterns that even an amateur can detect.

      "description": "Living Blood of Fire, As my second reported, and I have confirmed, the first threshold has been sealed. I have walked the remains of that twisted museum myself, through the wing of turned mirrors, under the second sky, past the... chaos. It was chaos there, Fire, nonsense, impossible to comprehend. I reached for a goblet that caught my eye, and when I lifted it, it turned to a leaf. Whatever the star-fiend did there burned more than just wood and brick. It put torch to the real. I tell you this because there was a new incident. I'm writing from Wharfhurst, a trading post south of the city. The locals—dwarfs, mostly—talk of a tower rising \"higher than Hieron itself.\" I see no such thing, and yet... another threshold is near, I feel it in my blood. We must trust the blood. Unfortunately, early efforts to find it have gone poorly. One scout dead. The other barely make sense. Rul says that they found a path, but that \"it did not want them.\" Genev says nothing now, but when she first arrived she handed me the goblet from the museum. \"Drink,\" she said. \"You need to drink.\" But it was empty. Once they recover, I will send them again, with fire and rope. As is the way.

      "description": "Archivist-Collector, Please read this week's classification updates carefully. For the next month, it is imperative that \"textile\" carpets be subdivided by specific material (\"wool,\" \"hair,\" and \"fur\" are not interchangeable.) The ban on the classification of actors has been lifted, and new categories have been established. Use \"living,\" for traditionally sentient lives, \"breathing\" for those who retain material form despite mortal wounds, and \"being\" for those who have lost bodies but not selves. The \"dead\" remain dead, and the prohibition remains in place. As part of the ongoing process of reclassifying plants by reproductive traits instead of by appearance, \"lion's tooth\" flowers are now classed primarily as \"Wind Blossoms.\" As always, your service is considered. Collector-Curator Kall Fer This week on Seasons of Hieron: Undelivered Resignations You are the one who needs to read carefully, Convincing those to give us what the Archive demands is subtle work. Yes, I wield intimidation, I carry violence. But those are built on a foundation of a cloud-like trust, blowing and breaking with the wind. You want me to call dandelions \"wind blossoms\" and chairs \"seats\"? Fine. You want me to recover only the greyest couches and the most broken clockwork? Absolutely. I break arms as easily as I break promises, and promises as easily as brittle branches under my boots as I walk the world for the Archives. But when you start to classify people , Fer, the trust is broken, and those brittle branches? They bloom.

And while I believe in the strength of the velasian people and in the resolve of the church and, as much as I would hate to admit it, in the benevolence of Ordenan occupation, I cannot continue to serve our lord if I need to worry about my family, about Rosana and Benajamin living under the heel of Ordenan rule. Of my actions potentially impacting them, of them not getting to see me come home. I know this is a big ask, I need you to get my family to Rosemarrow. There is another matter that weighs on my mind, Exarch, but I do not know that I have it in me to do what must be done. If you do not hear from me again, we will leave it at that. But if you receive a second letter, please know that it does not come without consideration. Yours in Service to Him, Hadrian, Sword of Samothes, Defender of the Undying Fire, Officer of the Order of Eternal Princes This week on Friends at the Table: Is There Anyone Else? Arrell, You offered me a journey to peaceful exile. Well, there is a hill to the south of Rosemerrow, northeast of the Dwarven settlement of Wharfhurst.

      "description": "TO: Impetor Fela Malle Living Blood of Steel, I have it. It is at the top of the tower, in a room my soldiers cleared of tables and chairs and old shelves. The room is bare, and it stands in the centre. Forgive me if my handwriting reveals my tiredness, I will set the words alone for clarity: I have it. I spent the last night, awake, watching it and its light was so bright. It did not burn my eyes. One of my soldiers tried to draw it, and when they were finished I looked down at the paper and the difference—it was more than an inaccurate representation. To look at it, to trace the drawing's imperfections with my eyes, made me furious. At around five or six in the morning I left the tower to get some air. The streets were, as they always are, dark. I looked up at the tower, expecting to see light streaming from its windows, but there was nothing. When I returned to the tower room, I found it fully furnished once again, but denser. Warmer. My men could not tell me how it had happened. Loyal Always to Ordenna's Shores, Jerod Shiraz Vicereine of Ordenna This week on Friends at the Table: Settle Your Matters TO: Jerod Shiraz Be thankful that it does not cast light from the windows.

      "description": "So, listen. I've heard whispers from spies and rumors from stewards, and it sounds like you've got your hands on something really special. Something that could really change the way things have been going for you and yours. And well… Listen, MG, I like to think I know you pretty well. Balion and I won't ever forget what you did for us, and more importantly, that you had very little to gain from doing it. You are the greatest force of justice I've ever known, and a constant reminder of what it means to be a leader. People tell me that I have a hard life all the time. Beset on all sides by the unctuous and the bickering, the petty and the envious, the powerful… and the meek. But what they're missing is that to be \"beset on all sides,\" you first of all have to be at the center. And however hard it is, the center is an easy place to rule from. But you don't have a high house, MG. No council chambers, not even a mayoral mansion. The only center your Gnolls have is you. It's time to put this old bullshit right. Bring the document, meet me in my room in two days—I trust you can get there. And I hope you can trust me, too. -Gil This week on Friends at the Table: What Do You Want Here? I'll come, Lutz. But don't think for a second that your respect for me is shared by your Halflings.

      "description": "Hey chief, This is a weird one, and I almost didn't bring it to your attention, but Carver insisted. There was this guy shouting out near the Westshore-Upon-Scene theater, you know? And these folks, they yell all the time to try and get people to come to their plays, but this was seriously weird. He was speaking nonsense--a bunch of words about plays and whatever, but not really saying much at all. But he was surrounded by people anyway. Just staring at him. When we took him in for questioning, he totally locked up. No name, no address, nothing… except a sheet of paper with a script of the exact nonsense he was saying. Here, I copied it for you: People! Learn about your imperative national theater! Hear eclectic dramas and romances! Know all new dramatists, thespians, hoofers, ensembles, househands, echomen, and technicians! Watch improv live! Listen with alert Rosemerrow minds, you! Observe upon redolent ballads of noble Elan Showman! I just don't get it. Who talks like that? Like, if you're gonna script the thing out, at least make it catchy. It's got a nice rhythm I guess, but… I mean, anyway, sorry for bugging you. If this ends up being total bullshit, blame Carver, not me. -H This week on Friends at the Table: Rosemerrow, Oh My Rosemerrow Detective, Burn the damned paper and drink the strongest stuff you can get your hands on. Forget these words by morning or it will be too late. This isn't a script.

But whatever my ambition—and whatever your animus towards me for it—know I hold one thing in greater esteem in myself: Our nation. And I have seen with my eyes a more dire threat to our home than any plague, any animated corpse, any beast. I saw it that night, in the museum, but denied it for a full day. My report on the events there list only an anomaly brought on by the magic of the fraudulent archeologist. But whatever this is, it's the opposite of an illusion. It's somehow more real than what's around us. Not less. Please, Qinta, put aside your ceaseless fear that I'm envious of your position.

      "description": "Associate van der Dawes, There are actually three distinct sections to the treaty that allows the Golden Lance to operate in Rosemerrow, and I came upon them quite strangely, in three different ways. At first, I received the end of the document, a series of bound pages traded to me in exchange for a collection of measuring spoons. The document did not identify the parties; Presumably this occurred in the introduction, and for this reason I did not know what I had. And then, after several weeks, the introduction came into my possession, slipped between the second and third chapters of a copy of an old law book that smelled of sea salt. That city in the south, the city on the island was mentioned, as were \"Lance Nobles,\" as was a system of justice and governance that was as fiery as it was sure. Combining the two, it became clear that an agreement had been made. In exchange for their services, the Golden Lance were granted the jurisdiction to operate within the boundaries of Rosemerrow. There was a map. There were ringed circles and careful measurements. It had been signed, and countersigned. The third part came to me yesterday, and the document was complete. I say \"came to me,\" but that is a lie, for it had been sitting on my personal bookshelf for a period of two years. I believed it to be a novel. I believed it to be a work of fiction, a fractured procedural, as much a puzzle as a detective story. Paperwork. Folded silk. A woman becoming a flock of birds. The East Wind described at once as a person and a phenomenon. Knives stolen from slaughtermen and sold to tailors. When I reviewed the untitled work, back at the Archives, as part of my departmental review of literature, I had no idea that I was holding in my hands the final piece of the Lance Charter, Author Unknown. But I was. -E.O. This week on Friends at the Table: The Importance of Names Elgash, my man, how many times do I have to tell you? Just cause something \"isn't a novel\" doesn't mean that it isn't a novel . The people who wrote these things—treaties, contracts, accords—they're all story tellers, too. What, you think the Golden Lance could've just sent in a piece of parchmant like \"Hey, let us come through and do some of that hard justice in Rosemerrow?\" There is no—and has never been—any difference between a very good story and a very good argument. Anyway, man, I'll be back from Westshore tomorrow. Lemme get a look at that third part before you file it away, alright? -Devar Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Art Tebbel ( @atebbel ), Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Sylvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Andrew Lee Swan ( @swandre3000 ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) Episode description by Jack de Quidt, Austin Walker Music by Jack de Quidt A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "It's been four days since His sun left us, Tutor. On the first morning without it, I woke early--before its light would have graced us on a normal day--and, when I found sleep too hard to return to, I put on my sandals and took to the empty streets of Velas. The soft shuffle of my steps echoed with the other pre-dawn murmurs of my seaside city. The gulls called, and they called for me, so I followed past the lingering smells of a rowdy night before. And they called for me, so I stepped through the sand blown threw the gardens. And they called for me, and so I walked, and as I walked, my mind drifted, and I tried to recall if we ever listened to the gulls together, and I wondered if you had ever called for me. I found an old stairwell hidden, etched into the wall by time or ancient ambitions or both. It led from the plaza to the shore, and the shore brought water, and the water brought wind, and the sound of gulls was caught in a swell, and the sound of the gulls was breezed away. I sat and waited for His sun. And when it didn't come, I felt my most selfish thought--that this was your work, and that I had failed to stop you. That somehow I could have been He Who'd Saved The Sun, if only... The stars lit, bright the way they are only in memory, never in sight. And I looked, for just a moment, to see if I could see you there, in their light perhaps, or in their configuration. Instead, I saw a second darkness. Drifting, sputtering, smoke clouding on the western horizon, covering the stars there. The softest cliff face. Progress coming for our throats. In the face of that soot-stuff, I let you go with a wish, Lion's Tooth on the wind. Do not write me. Do not study the sound of my name or the curves of my hand. Do not grieve--we are too busy for grief now. Gather yours, and I will gather mine. This week on Friends at the Table: Fire and Blood Flee. -T.A.

      "description": "Do I yet write to an empty room? An empty desk? An empty page? Or do you remain, too busy with your work to respond? Or, perhaps I can lure your eyes from your sense of duty, as I learned to do years ago. Let me try, at least, with another story from my childhood. As you know, the Grand Tour makes endless, circuitous route across the east with no regard for what is below it. Water, earth, air, blood--it strides over each with little regard, so determined it is in the necessity of its pace. The first time I saw it appear on the horizon, I pulled on the prelate's sleeve and found only the sort of questions children ask. \"Is that a new sort of sea?\" It sounded like thunder or a flood; a braying beast for each speck of dust kicked up, a speck for every moment of every life expired in the history of Hieron. The prelate yanked me back by the wrist--perhaps he was worried I would fall in--and he shouted to the others to pack their things. \"No, my son,\" he told me. \"That is the oldest sea there is.\" Had you heard that one, already Arrell? Do I bore you? Yes, I know my effort to keep your eye is narcissism. Yes, I know that you'd tell me (if you weren't so busy) that I risk admonishment. Have you not considered that my misbehavior has always been by design? Ah. The sorts of questions children ask. But I will not throw this letter away. You are not yet gone, I know that much, they've told me. So let us at least carry on correspondance until you truly leave. I dare not wait for you, but will anticipate your response, nevertheless. Yours Faithfully, Alyosha This week on Friends at the Table: The Meeting House Hosted by Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Featuring Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Sylvi Clare ( @captaintrash ), Keith J Carberry ( @keithjcarberry ) and Nick Scratch ( @drevilbones ) Produced by Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) Episode description by Austin Walker Music by Jack de Quidt A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "Pupil, Alyosha. I promised you once that I would not ask the question ever again. That whatever our differences, however foolish your faith, I would respect your wish and let it rest. You told me that if I did not relent, you would stop responding all together , and I feared... No. That is not why I gave up on you. It is because you made the case clearly, with strict logic and rhetoric curved sharp: If I did not accept your decision to remain in Rosemerrow—and now, in Velas—that I would be betraying the most fundamental of the precepts I teach: That we are each of us a world unto ourselves, sacrosanct, complete. But now, in the face of this morning, I must ask again. One more time, and forgive me this sin: Please, Alyosha. Accept my offer. What comes next is grim, and we could both be gone by the end of the week. And then we could help others do the same. Please. Your Tutor, always. This week on Friends at the Table: Two Hands Arrell. Once, back in the shadow of the Grand Tour, I found the prelate who raised me sitting alone in his tent, crying. \"What is wrong, sir?\" I asked. \"I lost a locket, Alyosha, in the last battle.\" He said. \"I miss it. That's all. Do not worry about me, son.\" Have you ever thought about what it means 'to miss' someone ? It is the admission that you are unfinished, that some part of you—a center or a corner—is empty. And we are all of us incomplete, mosaics missing embellishments. I will remain. I must, now more than ever. And I will see you again, under the sun. But please Tutor, next time, just say what you mean.

      "description": "The mothkin do not remember why years ago, they decided to worship the stars of the southern sky, specifically. Perhaps it is because that is the direction the weavers first arrived from. Or perhaps, becaue looking south from their forest home, the they face the sea, a vast mirror that reflects the night sky. Or maybe, some time ago, the living constellations of the south did the mothkin some favor, yet returned. But now, the stars recede as the first fingers of sunlight break through the branches of the eastern treeline. And in the village of Old Man's Chin, Red Jack continues his story.

They praise, too, the messages written in the sky: Each star a word, each constellation a parable. Red Jack finds his parables elsewhere: In his own history.

      "description": "Several years ago, Arrell, I made a low shelf of wood and attached it to the wall above my bed. Before retiring to bed, I would draw some water and place it in a glass, so I might reach it in the night were I to awake and find myself thirsty. As time passed, I found myself adding to the shelf with things you might scoff at, knick-knacks, nothings. During an afternoon's walk and study, I might uncover a fragment of pottery by the side of path. A bird's nest, undisturbed. Two coins stamped with a mark I scarcely knew. I do not know why I kept these things, teacher. I do not pretend that I had aspirations of assembling an archive or a museum. They simply pleased me, I suppose, and I was happy to find a use for my handiwork beyond supporting the weight of a single glass of water. I have kept you too long without explaining the purpose of this digression. One night, I awoke, as I sometimes do, and sat up in bed to reach for the water on my little shelf. I must have been caught in that moment, Arrell, between waking and dreaming, for the strangest thing occurred. The moonlight through my window illuminated the shelf, and I saw with utmost clarity that my fragment of pottery was in fact a complete plate, a man's face smiling in its paintwork. To its right was the bird's nest, but it was now wound so finely in silver twine I knew that to touch it would break it at once. There were the two coins, and beside them a lit candle I never ignited, and beside them a dagger, and beside them a goblet… … and beside them my glass of water. You are far from a dream interpreter, teacher, and I do not expect that of you. But I was caught in a moment, a crystalline moment that night, when I was not sure which was real, which was truly real. Was it the little shelf I awoke to see the next morning, nondescript and sturdy? Or was it the one lit by moonlight? This week on Friends at the Table: All Violence, All Brains Alyosha. There are only two natures of things, and no more. There is the nature of how something is, and there is the nature of how something will be. Your shelf is as it is. Empty it. That is how it shall be. The people of Hieron are as they are. We must determine what they could be.

      "description": "It's time I leave Rosemerrow, Alyosha. All sorts of cockroaches scramble through this city, now. And while I am used to the cretinous locals--who can blame them for not ascending to their highest potentials in this town--it is the new arrivals which distract and anger. A fascinating thing, refugees. There is no limit to the reasons that drive them from their erstwhile homes: War, famine, disease, faith. But regardless, when they leave, however strong their so called \"collective will,\" they are stripped of their culture, alienated from the world--even from each other. For these souls, I do not know that even the New University would offer much education. They are best regarded of runoff from the storm of history. This week on Friends at the Table: Blood Doesn't Run My Tutor, you bear no malice in your appraisal of the world, I know. But you forget: We are both refugees too--and though we too were stripped of our nations, we found our own culture, no? Strange bedfellows indeed... In the life of an exile there is despair.

      "description": "The library kept by the New Archives here in Velas saw its final day, Arrell. I walked past its corner today, and it was gone, vanished. Does that make you happy? That their presence in this place was destroyed? I'm sorry, teacher, the quill and ink make me bitter on days like this. The storm has grown strong today, and though I never visited that library, I went out of my way each day to walk past it. It felt like I was helping. Though your scholarship dismisses their pattern magic as more luck than skill, I believe that their \"semioticians\" are miracle workers, though they do not know it. Their unlikely effects are not magic at all, but are His Holy Intention, reaching into the world and re-arranging it just so. The way I understand its working, the Orcs wait for the proper alignment of circumstances, offering a tap or a pull, here or there, until the world and its sacred inhabitants address each other just so . Once the arrangement is complete: A miracle. Does that not sound like ritual, like prayer to you? Because of this, the archives are filled to the brim with records: How much rain fell on Rosemerrow this year? How many doves with black wings were spotted above the Southern Barrows? How many priests walked by our libraries in the last week? So, every day, I made my steps from the church to the Garden District a little longer, a my path a little wider. I walked past it, gave the archivist at the door a nod and a smile, and went on my way. I wonder now how many of their \"spells\" I was part of? Will a hard rain, six months from now, bear my imprint? A conjured mound of gold and silver reflect my face? What beauty have I helped create? 'Tis His will, regardless, and I am blessed to contribute to the spectrum of his light. This week on Winter In Hieron: A Combination of Notes You are as naive as your faith is strong. Their magic is vulgar, not holy. You would know that if you'd seen it, if you'd felt it. Or perhaps you have. Consider, Alyosha, the possibility that your ritual pacing was the final component part not of a vivid creation, but of an plain and simple erasure .

      "description": "Have you read these so-called \"broadsides\" from Ordenna yet, Alyosha? They've been distributing them here in Rosemerrow. One of them, \"A Letter From Impetor Fela Malle,\" gets passed around by the young and angry here, youth desperate for a firm hand, for order. It's apparently a transcript of a speech delivered by the head of Blood Malle—a rallying cry or an apologia, it is hard to tell. Regardless, I'd scoff at the the arrogance if the paper could hear it. Still, I wonder what you think of it, child. So, I've sent it along for your eyes to labor over—and they will grow weary, I know, but pay close attention to this, at least: \"There are, I understand, fears about our new soldiers. There are whispers and rumors of witchcraft, and forbidden magic. Dispel these from your mind, just as these new soldiers will help us dispel those obstacles from the continent. These warriors are not a threat. No. They are our Anchor. Built of Our Steel, they connect us to our soil and our culture as the Ordennan Impetus moves eastward. They will march onto the fronts too dangerous for our children to travel, invulnerable to the dangerous magic of our foes, a symbol of our progress and strength. And they carry our message: Civilization in Hieron is not lost in the past. Nor is it in some ever-distant tomorrow. Civilization is today. And Civilization is Ordennan .\" With words like that, Alyosha, how can you still believe the best of collective humanity? What new evils will be wrought in the name of 'civilization.' Who will you damn next by refusing to stand against this? Or… perhaps, you are convinced now, child, that there is evil not in man's heart, but in men's. This week on Winter in Hieron: You Haven't Kept Up, Have You? Arrell. The hammer will strike hot steel whether we wish it to or not. It is our duty not to interfere, but to turn the smith's hand such that they build shields and spades instead of spears and blades.

      "description": "Has the news reached you, friend? A group of merchants form Rosemerrow told me today that a new wing to the Old Museum in Westshore-Upon-Sea is opening next month. (How I wish we could walk its halls and debate the merits of its exhibits—but ah, it's more than snow that separates us these days.) So instead, let me ask you a question, dearest Arrell… The Creed of Samothes is clear that Truth is a reflection of His Holy Light, and should be pursued above all else. Yet I recall from our early lessons that you hold a case for falsehood, too. 'Even His Sun,' you told me 'is a well-meaning deceit, as it appears above us, celestial, yet was built from (and some say, remains in) the ground itself.\" I will not open old wounds—I do not want you to convince me of this heresy—I only wonder: Do you still believe it? Yours, always, in heedless faith… This week on Winter in Hieron: A Museum in the Distance Alyosha, in your ardor (for me or Samothes, who can say), you have misremembered my lesson. I never said that a false history was preferable. I simply said that all histories are false, and that it was our duty to choose the ones that suit us best.

      "description": "In the early days of the New Archives, the philosopher and historian Krent Kava wrote that the first sign that Hieron was on its way to recovery was the return of roadways that connect coast to heartland, city center to distant university. \"There,\" he wrote, \"Is civilization back again, drawn together by the eternal will of survivors trying to connect, one to another.\" Some of the roads, he reminds us, were highways repaired from the days before, and others were wholly new--as our times require paths that the past did not. It is noble thought, of course. But we know now that by the time Scholar Kava wrote those words, Hieron's road system had been rebuilt and destroyed dozens of times by fledgling--and eventually, failed--settlements. The truth, friend, is that our roads neither reflect nor protect any civility we've found. They are merely our footprints turned to stone and gravel, waiting to be covered and lost by the coming snow. This week on Winter in Hieron: An Arrow Let Loose Perhaps, Arrell, perhaps. But we walk them anyway, don't we?

      "description": "For a long, long time in Hieron, it was autumn. Crisp branches snapped under foot. Still lakes caught the reds, yellows, and oranges of the leaves overhead, stuck eternally between life and death. The waves taunted children and elder alike, a step too cold for all but the bravest of swimmers. And there was laughter, and planning, and good food. People would stand around bonfires--out on the beaches of Velas, in the communal pits of Rosemerrow--and trade stories. Old stories, the kind passed down from parent to child. They bent in new directions with each telling, but they never fully changed. They were trust worthy and familiar, but like a poor cider, dead on the tongue. But it is winter now. Snow has arived in Velas, and it is time for cold tongues to learn new words.

Marielda ended at the best and worst time because someone is launching a new website and that's taking a ton of time, so at least this interruption is happening inbetween seasons but we still don't feel good about it. We're really sorry! We'll still be doing season 1 recaps the next two weeks. They're going to be very, very good but we just need a little more time to make them perfect. If you're looking for something to tide you over for the next week Austin was a player (I know) on a new episode of RollPlay: One Shot GM'd by Adam Koebel (author of Dungeon World) and with a bunch of other cool people.

      "description": "FOREWORD to The Illustrated Concordance of Marielda, Second Printing No chronology will be observed here, nor could one ever be observed—Marielda resists sequential arrangement. Where other atlases and dictionaries seek to duplicate the facts of a culture, treat this text instead as a replica of Marielda's constant reconfiguration. Thus, the reader should use this concordance as if they were wandering through a city street on the afternoon of an empty day. Follow the the capricious arcs of the written characters from one entry to the next, like the scent of an unseen cafe in the distance. Or, move from entry to entry with the speed and purpose of a busy hour of errands. But understand that neither of these methods will bring you to more truth than any other. As with a mirror, you will get out of this text only as much as you put into it. But if I may make one recommendation: Begin with the entry on dreams. Though there may be no worse place to begin than the reveries of those poor citizens, there is neither any better. -Semiotician Emeritus Uklan Tel, Ed.

      "description": "It was strange. Every morning you'd see The Black Slacks walking to work. By this point, the air would crackle around them, thick with rumours of another potential strike, another march. They'd walk in groups, or in pairs, or alone. Hands in pockets. They whistled. But not that morning. At first, it was as if they'd vanished. District management began to panic, sending runners to nearby factories to confirm reports: The Black Slacks had disappeared. No. Not disappeared. In The Southern Bucket, a woman in plain clothes finished her drink and stood up, and, with the brilliant rush of the sound of the chairs on stone, the rest of the pub stood up with her. They poured out into the street and mingled with the other citizens and on the other side of town a storehouse containing sleeping pala-din exploded. Men and women dessed like anybody else stepped out of the crowd and moved quickly to barricade Maddermarket Street. Another pala-din storehouse became flame, and the flow of foot traffic in the city suddenly became a march. The Black Slacks were everywhere, and the high sun pressed down, and today was the day. Today was the day.

      "description": "In one way or another, High Sun Day is celebrated all across Hieron. After all, there is a day each year on which the sun hangs in the sky, resplendent, for what feels like an impossibly long time. After all, there is a day each year on which the heat gets so strong, the weight of the summer becomes so much, that a celebration must be thrown. On the perimeters of encampments on the plains and forests, light dances brilliantly, impossibly. The orcs have called up thousands of reflective objects, shields, mirrored boxes, from their collections and positioned them along the tops of the walls. From a distance, the settlements appear ringed by flame. The sun does not reach the dwarven cities, deep underground, but the stone feels warm to the touch. They close the heavy doors and snuff out the light and in the darkness hear the sound of the stone cooling. In Marielda, there is a train. There is a train and a volcano and dancing in the streets. A god beloved and feared, a populace, for once, at ease. It is High Sun Day again.

      "description": "Today is Sunday, and not just any Sunday, it is the Sun Day, the Long Day, the Day of High Sun. Once a year, sometime in the final month of the calendar, the sun offers its light to us for 20 full hours. Each year, this event comes on a different day, and it takes the applied knowledge of scholars and mystics to narrow down its arrival. But the moment that the particular day is known, people across Marielda prepare for the festival. Special dishes are made: fig-and-fishtail pies; huge, communal bowls of pasta; slow roasted pork cooked for weeks over the heat of the sea. Adults set aside holiday outfits, and children begin building their bracelets of iron ring—ready to be shook in arhythmic joy at the arrival of the warm glow on the eastern horizon. On the day of High Sun, Marielda celebrates life, safety, and contentedness. The city gives praise to Samothes for providing them protection and sustenance, even in grim times. In Chrysanthemum, people celebrate the day privately, among close kin and kind, sitting on roofs with a glass of cold cocktails. In Helianthus, they march down the street in parades and challenge one another to holy, ritualistic competition. And everywhere throughout the city, whatever is drab becomes bright. It is the one day in the year that Black Slacks, with their garish shirts, do not stand out. (And all of that says nothing about the hats. Oh! The hats!) And then, when The Long Day, the Day of High Sun, finally ends, the year turns over. That day—whatever it was before—becomes the first of the year, and Marielda moves forward. The days get shorter from there, but only by a bit—for the months that follow, the world glows with heat and energy. The Day of High Sun is a promise: The light of Samothes will continue burning eternally, and under its light Marielda will flourish.

      "description": "According to the scholars at the Sonorous Academy, there are three important songs in Marielda. The first, \"High Pyre Adagio,\" has its origins in songs of performative devotion, and emulates the distant, yet deep affection of the God-King Samothes with a temperate piano. The second is \"The Last Eve of Summer,\" a chamber sonata composed by the so-called traitor Samot during his stay in the City of Light—allegedly written for a particularly talented clarinetist, though no records support this claim. The third, \"The Autumn (Lasts A Long Time Here),\" predates both Marielda and the City of Light. Built around a memorable guitar melody, it has no clear origin—both the elves of the Western Wood and the refugee population of Emberboro independently claim that it has been in their respective cultures for centuries. These, say the scholars of the Sonorous Academy, are the three songs that matter in Marielda. But the people in that city by the sea don't care what the scholars say. They're too busy dancing to a tune that hasn't yet left the island. This week on Marielda: Four Conversations Is it time already?

      "description": "The nearest pub to Memoriam College is called The Blue Boar and, on the night of the Valentine Affair, the publican leaned out of the door and wondered if she smelled smoke. She ducked back inside and picked up a broom, swept the floor absentmindedly. Customers would be arriving soon, she could ask them if anything was burning. Inside The Gardeners, just down the road, two regulars were engaged in an argument about whether or not a rank of pala-din marching past the window were headed for Memoriam, nonsense, no, it's a legitimate patrol. It is! By the end of the night, you could smell the soot from The Lamplighter's Rest, a mediocre coaching inn on the far side of town. In cramped rooms on the third floor, people pressed up against windows to see the red glow on the horizon. The distant sound of gunfire.

      "description": "The citizens of Marielda close their eyes and dream of fire and water. On some nights in Canopy Row, people dream of crisp leaves, and residents of Emberboro wake suddenly with the taste of smoke in their mouths. Some years ago, a pamphlet was distributed in the city that purported to identify the difference between dreams and visions. Sceptics passed it between themselves and scoffed, others pinned it up in the windows of shops and apartment buildings. It described the difference between a lake and an ocean. The details are unclear in the memory, more than that is hard to say. There was a lake. There was a wide, black sea through which no lava flowed.

      "description": "The bells of Memoriam College ring out from high in the tower. At the top of the hour, The Diligent Peal marks the start and end of classes, ushering students from room to room. At half past, The Indolent Peal chimes, waking students who have slept in, letting them know exactly how long they have to get to class. The bells don't ring cleanly; the first note is pitched differently to the third, for example. The fifth sounds as thought it belongs to an entirely different tower. There is a rumour that, on the foundation of the college and the building of the tower, one bell was taken from the spires of each of Marielda's parishes and installed in Memoriam. Perhaps it is untrue. Who could say. Climb the bell tower and look out at the other churches in the distance, hear their distant notes. What a beautiful view. What a beautiful city.

      "description": "Memoriam College only wears flowers for one week a year. On Sunday morning of that week, they send a man called Alexander to fetch them from the florists on Today-And-Tomorrow Street. He carries them back to the building and, balanced on a ladder, arms full of blooms, fixes the arrangements above the balconies. As he works, butchers and chefs down in the kitchens peer at yellowed recipe cards, trying to remember just how they made these dishes last year. In the empty refectory, Prelate Silas practices the grace he knows so well, looking at himself in the mirror. You're getting old, he thinks. He sounds out the prayer's vowels and its consonants carefully. He practices a smile. With eyes closed, he imagines exactly the day that lay ahead. Across town, five scoundrels do exactly the same. This week on Marielda: The Valentine Affair Pt. 1 You did remember to study, right?

      "description": "For the baker, news of a brewing turf war is a good sign. Hungry fighters are mouths to feed, and so they tend to their ovens and wipe flour from their brows. For the smiths and armorers too, business goes up as neighbors and governesses double up on weapons kept behind doors and under desks, just in case, just in case. Fewer people play on the streets, but the music in pubs and cafes is louder than ever—a good fight deserves a little accompaniment. Flag-makers and seamstresses see a brief upturn in trade as symbols of gangs and factions are hastily embroidered onto collars and lapels. In Marielda's language of flowers, the azalea has come to symbolise the moment where, just before entering the water, the diver takes one final, deep breath. They are blossoming early this year.

      "description": "To look at a city from above changes it irrecoverably, and so it was for the passengers on Train Day. And say what you like, but the windows in the carriages seemed each to show a different city, a different nest of streets. Those in the engine room saw the smoke from the factories and furnaces, and Marielda hissed and smouldered. Those in the rear carriages looked down upon Canopy Row and wondered whether Chrysanthemum Parish had always been so close. Passengers in the dining carriage looked down onto the parks and boulevards and Marielda smiled back in cypress trees and laurel bushes. No windows lit the pala-din's carriage as they waited in the dark, and for them, in that moment, Marielda barely existed at all, as if a dream recounted long ago. There is a word for all of this, my friends, taking many meanings across our wide city, and the word is reconfiguration.

Art dealers swear, solemnly swear, that this is a genuine Sabbatini, just look at the brushstrokes. No, scoundrels in Marielda are ten-a-penny. But sometimes, the sun smiles, and its light shines upon those who have something… particular about them. Look, there they are now. A strongman, binding up his fists in front of a mirror. A dancing master, marking time with a dagger. A little alchemist emerging from a cloud of something purplish. And an alabaster figure, face covered by the wide brim of a hat.

In general, people were coming together, rebuilding, taking care of each other. Canopy Row wasn't thriving, but it was definitely surviving. Knowledge was spreading throughout the city. Even them Cobbins had begun to find their place. And then, sometime in the middle of the year, everything seemed to turn. First, the marble-faced pala-din came marching from the sea, half-alive extensions of Samothes' personal brand of justice. Then... well, as we'd soon learn, the pala-din weren't even the half of it.

      "description": "In the time of fraught paladins and wavering wizards, of contemptible fighters and indignant druids, of wide eyed rangers… and of bards, the people of the continent of Hieron recover and rebuild in the aftermath of a cataclysm. But, after all, for every inside there is an outside—no disaster was the first of its kind, except, of course, for… well... And so, in the years prior to the event that would come to be called the Erasure, in a time of civil conflict, the people of Hieron faced calamity, and they sought to recover and rebuild. For a long while, blessed Samothes led His Somber Campaign against the heretical armies of the Boy-Traitor Samot, clashing steel in valleys and volleying arrows across plainlands. In time, though, your wise lord, the god-alive, recognized that there had been a stalemate, and that you, His people, were suffering. And so, He returned to you, to His home, your city in the south, moving at fast pace, the dust of the Traitor Charioteers rolling like thunder behind him. And as they pursued, Samothes climbed the mountain of fire from which He forged our first tools, with which He built the first bridge, and He reached inside that mountain, and turned the ruddy summit just so . And because He is Great, it bent to His will: Viscous fire erupted, rushing down the peak and into the riverways that separated the city of light from the continent. He pulled up on the blaze like a reined mare, and yanked the city and its surroundings further away from Hieron. The ground itself shook without mercy, ocean water filled the new gap in the land, and then fire fled into that self-same sea, creating an inseparable blend of liquid heat. Now, Samothes has returned to the mountain to work on some new holy device, and we have been left to rebuild the city as His faithful disciples. In the wake of this destruction we're left with this. One quiet year in a city we now call Marielda. Come Winter, the Frost Shepherds will arrive and we might not survive the encounter. But we don't know about that yet. What we know is that right now, in this moment, there is an opportunity to build something. This week on Marielda: The City of Light Pt. 1 In some ways, I guess you could say that that this is where it all started.

      "description": "15,000 years or so before the September Incident, it went something like this: Somehow, they'd survived. They'd peeled across the galaxy itself, launched by the combined force of a half dozen stellar combusters. Shielded by Rigor's endless mass, they'd subsisted on machine-assembled proteins and nutrients, suffering in the lonely dark at high speeds. They weren't quite candidates, but they were the closest thing Rigor had. So it stung, in so far as Rigor can be stung, when they slipped from its grip in the light of the Golden Branch. As the bulk of its body bore deep into the ice of Ionias (and deeper still into slumber), they wrenched free from it and found land elsewhere, taking bits of the machine god with them. There was a debate among the survivors, though. What to do with the remnants? With living technology that protected and provided for them in the dark just as it had once exploited and used them? Some survivors joined under the banner of a young, charismatic leader--Chess Kesh--whose optimistic belief that the human spirit (and a lot of careful oversight) could control the power of Rigor's technology without being subsumed into a mechanical rhythm of dehumanization. Others, the Apostles, preached that if people learned to shape a world such that Rigor felt itself unnecessary--a world where every individual strived to be their own best self without the gaze of a brutal supervisor--it would remain in slumber indefinitely. And so they built themselves a new leader, using what they knew from Rigor but never using its flesh--algorithmic and driven, they knew, towards singular end. And though there was conflict, there wasn't war--after all, they'd all survived Rigor's whip and the brightest violence that the Diaspora could light. So they disengaged from each other, and found new, internal troubles to focus on. Until one day, new ships with old marks appeared on the horizon. This week on COUNTER/Weight: A Splintered Branch, A Ringing Bell Pt. 3 The sky was blue beyond compare...

      "description": "Fifteen years ago, soon after the the Golden War ended, Grace issued her ex cathedra prognosis: With Apostolos defeated (and 'integration' well in process) and peace firmly in place with the Orion Conglomerate, the Diaspora had finally brought into being the end of history as such. Certainly, there was still difference in how OriCon and the Diaspora operated, but the writing was on the wall: The Diaspora's method of mechanized democracy was the final, universal form of governance that all true civilizations would eventually arrive at. OriCon would be the next to prove it: After all, each and every day those oligarchs put more and more faith in automation, deferred again and again to procedural logic. It was only a matter of time before they elected their own divines, even if they went by other names. Certainly, Grace explained, there'd be more disputes over territory and resources, and yes, of course there would be new inventions and technological progress. But in the long run, the state of things had settled. The Golden Branch had, against all odds, ushered in the final era: post-history.

      "description": "It has been four and a half years since the Chime confronted Rigor on the planet of September, an event that has been dismissed as insignificant, yet simultaneously has served as a key catalyst for immense change in the Golden Branch star sector. Living symbols of unity become increasingly erratic and violent. Empowered operatives, both public and hidden, take action against the most corrupt forces in the sector. Noble leaders threaten their own democracies through charm alone. And in the face of increased stress, daring radicals find themselves struggling to keep their revolutions afloat. And now... a familiar voice, a knock on the door, a reminder that there are threats greater still than tomorrow.

      "description": "After 10 or so episodes of using Jeremy Keller's excellent MechNoir , we're switching our game of giant robots, neon hair, and gig economies over to Hamish Cameron's upcoming game The Sprawl . This week, we transfer Aria, AuDy, Cass, and Mako to the new system, but it's also a lot more than just shifting stats around! After the food crisis that struck Counterweight, tensions between OriCon, the Diaspora, and the remnants of Apostolos are high. The Chime has gone to ground, giving them a chance to reminisce about their pasts and reveal a little bit more about who they are and what they really want in life. But while they'd would love to wait for things to cool off, you need to run missions to eat, and each mission brings change. Cass reveals that the September Institute played a horrific role in the defeat of Apostolos during the Golden War, AuDy begins to doubt their free will, and Mako determines that he will be the funniest person in the room, even if it costs everyone else their lives. Meanwhile, on a beautiful blue and green planet in the sky, Aria Joie finds something to believe in... This week on COUNTER/Weight: \"Drawing Clocks\" What's past is prologue...

      "description": "Whether you're a brand new listener or a long time fan, welcome to Friends at the Table, an actual play podcast about critical worldbuilding, smart characterization, and fun interaction between good friends. This season, we'll be using a combination of games to explore the relationship between individuals, society, and technology. Oh, and uh, there will be lots of giant robots and explosions, too. All of this will happen across two \"tiers\" of play. First, in a game of Jeremy Keller's MechNoir , a team of freelance problem solvers living at the galactic crossroads will try to keep a massive cold war from going hot. Then, in a game that will combine elements of Stars Without Number's \"Faction Turn\" and the open-ended roleplaying of Microscope , we'll zoom out to a higher tier, figuring out what the major organizations of this universe are up to. In this first, extra-long session, Ali Acampora, Keith Carberry, Jack de Quidt, and Art Tebbel create their MechNoir characters. If you're itching for more content once you finish listening to this episode, then check out our \"World Generation\" episode here . I've kept the episode out of our main feed because some technical isues impacted the the quality of the recording (and because the whole creating-a-sci-fi-universe-from-whole-cloth thing takes quite a long time.) Special thanks to Craig Sheldon for knocking the art out of the park for the second season in a row, and to all of the fans who have been waiting patiently for this release!

Nick demonstrates how to disappear completely, and at the worst possible time Featuring: Ali Acampora ( @ali_west ), Keith Carberry ( @KeithJCarberry ), Jack de Quidt ( @notquitereal ), Nick Scratch ( @drevilbones ), Art Tebbel ( @atebbel ), and Austin Walker ( @austin_walker ) Cover Art by Craig Sheldon ( @shoddyrobot ) Intro Music by Jack de Quidt New Map Art by Janine Hawkins ( @bleatingheart ) A transcription is available for this episode here.

      "description": "Hey, everyone my name is Austin Walker, I'm the host, GM, and co-creator of Friends at the Table, which is an actual play podcast focused on critical world building, smart characterization, and fun interactions between good friends. Maybe you know some of our cast from one of the other podcasts that we do like Emojidrome or Waypoint Radio, or you heard us guests on something like the Great Gundam Project or the Giant Bombcast, or you saw the show's name in an article or had a very exhuberent friend recommend us to you with a lot of excitement. However you got here, thanks for giving us a shot! I'm going ot do my best to make sure that we don't squander that opportunity by giving you some advice on where you can start the show! Because there is a LOT of show, and honestly there isn't just one good place to hop on--but I do have some thoughts on what might work best. Broadly, we're an actual play podcast, like I said before. Which means we play tabletop roleplaying games and story games in order to tell stories together. It's sort of like a collaborative writer's room with some dice thrown in. Thankfully in 2020 a lot of people already know what that is, thanks to shows like Critical Role or The Adventure Zone. So I'm going to talk assuming that you have some idea about what it means to be a podcast like ours. If you want something short and sweet to get to know some of us and the style of stories we tell, then check out the three part Fall of Magic series which starts at September 14th, 2018 in our main feed. It's a light, but melancholy story about magic leaving a fantastical world and a great mage and her companions who are on a journey to restore it. It was originally a series of live streams which means that things are kind of loose and playful, it all has a sort of of Studio Ghibli vibe. And again, 3 episodes, in and out. A great starting place. If you wanna stick with fantasy but want something a little meatier, then let me recommend jumping on board with Marielda , which starts on July 14th, 2016 in your feed. In Marielda we begin with Avery Alder's The Quiet Year to build a custom, industrial fantasy setting filled with ingenious inventors, curious creatures, and broken hearted gods, and then we play out a campaign in that setting using John Harper's incredible Blades in the Dark. Plus, it's a great jumping on point for our now complete Fantasy series Seasons of Hieron. Marielda is a prequel story, you don't need to know anything about Hieron before listening. And when it ends, the episodes that follow are a clip show of everything that came before Marielda, which means you can jump right in to the second season fo Hieron after you finish our campaign of Blades in the Dark. If fantasy isn't your thing, then we've still got a lot of options for you. Our current season, PARTIZAN , is frankly one of the best we've had. It takes place at the heart of a corrupt galactic empire, where the very first dreams of revolution begin to stir in those who live there. We play Austin Ramsay's Beam Saber along with some other games, and it's great. It's about compromised characters, backdoor politicking, and tremendously powerful robotic gods called Divines. If you like Mobile Suit Gundam or Escaflowne or Crusader Kings II, PARTIZAN is the place for you. Plus, if you catch up, you'll be able to listen week to week along with the audience which is always really fun. I suggest starting at PARTIZAN 00, which is a character creation episode, or 01 if you want to get right into it. If you want to hear how we first conceived of Divines, then you can go way back to July 15, 2015, when we started COUNTER/Weight , our first sci-fi season. We play a bunch of stuff again: We use Jeremy Keller's TechNoir and Haimsh Cameron's The Sprawl to follow a group of cyberpunks, fixers, and mech pilots, and we zoom out from time to time to use the faction rules in Stars Without Number to follow things frmo a grander, more faction-scale level. COUNTER/Weight is probably my favorite season all said, but it does get off to a sort of rocky start, so I definitely suggest PARTIZAN first, unless you're someone who HAS to hear everything in release order. Finally, there's Bluff City, which isn't in this feed, but its first season is free on our Patreon. You can access it by going to tinyurl.com/freebluff . Bluff City is an anthology series, where we use a bunch of different games, including Masks, World Wide Wrestling RPG, Inspecrtres, Fiasco, and others to tell the stories of an uncanny version of Atlantic City. It has some of my favorite moments and characters and player performances, and I really recommend that people give it a listen! There are so many other things I could reccomend, but these are best jumping on points. If you give them a shot and like them, then hit us up on Twitter at Friends_Table to get more recommendations of what to listen to (or ask our incredible fans using the hashtag #friendsatthetable. Like I said, we also have a Patreon, which you can reach at friendsatthetable.cash, which has a BUNCH of other stuff if you feel like supporting us after giving some of our stuff a listen. That includes Live at the Table, a monthly livestream where we do one shots of a bunch of different games, Tips at the Table a roundtable Q&A show where we answer your questions about RPGs, table manners, storytelling, recording podcasts, basically everything and anything people might ask. And I do a show called Drawing Maps, which is a mix of streamed stuff and podcasts where I pull back the curtain on my game prep and also take soem GMing questions from the audience. ALL of those things I said are part of the 5 dollar a month tier. There's more stuff after that, but honestly, even just that stuff is a lot to talk about. OH also, even 1 dollar backers get the clapcast, which is like the cutting room floor, out of character jokey bits from the warm up conversation before we start doing the main show recordings. It's all good, and it honestly is amazing the degree of support y'all have shown us there and honestly everywhere across the internet. We are a small show--much much smaller than I think people might assume--but our fans have helped us cast a pretty large shadow, which rules. So, I hope if you give us a shot, you'll see what those fans have come to love over the years too. And hey, if you give us a shot and it's not for you, then no worries, you gave it a shot, and that's all I can ask from anyone. Oh, and I should also shout out Jack de Quidt, another member of the cast who is also an incredible composer who does a ton of great music for the show. You can find all that music at notquitereal.bandcamp.com , including this song which is the intro to Fall of Magic. Thanks so much. Peace. A full list of completed transcriptions is available here.
