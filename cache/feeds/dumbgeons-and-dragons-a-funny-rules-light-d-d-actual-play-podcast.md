      "description": "Happy New Year! We return with an in-depth creator chat between Russ, Kyle and two of the voices behind The Adventures of Bud and Herb Evan Bivins and Anna \"Fitz\" Fitzgerald. In this nearly hour long conversation we walk through each other's process, what we have found rewarding about actual play podcasting and SO MUCH MORE! We had an absolute blast speaking with them and look forward to more collaborations to come. After the chat you'll hear an episode of The Adventures of Bud and Herb - Out in the Koldhørn The Adventures of Bud & Herb is a hybrid show — half polished audio fiction, half actual play — but all one big unfolding story. If you’ve ever wished a TTRPG podcast felt like a TV show in your ears, this is it. The first half of the season is scripted, the second half is played in a game of Daggerheart by Darrington Press. No one, including the creators, know how the season will end. TPK anyone?
