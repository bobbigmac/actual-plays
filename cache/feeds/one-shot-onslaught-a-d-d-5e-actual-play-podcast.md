  "description": "We are an actual-play fifth-edition Dungeons and Dragons podcast. The thing that we do different is that we play through popular one-shot modules from dmsguild.com which means that you can drop in and listen to any session without having to be all caught up! We split each one-shot into two separate episodes so that we can release our podcast bi-weekly! If you like bite-sized chunks of D&D that you can drop in and out of without needing to following a larger over-arching narrative then we are your show!

      "description": "The Curious Tale of Wisteria Vale is the script of a play written in Common. It is split up into three acts, telling the story of a heroic bard before he becomes corrupted by evil. A wizard named Ryllia Liadon donated the book to Candlekeep as an entrance gift. She didn’t tell the Avowed that the book contains the secret to accessing Wisteria Vale, a magical demiplane created by the Harpers to imprison a bard named Arrant Quill until they could free him from the influence of an evil artifact. The book has been hidden in the Candlekeep archives for three years, but the Harpers have finally discovered a cure for Quill’s corruption, and the time has come to visit Wisteria Vale once more.
