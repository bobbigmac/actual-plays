I want to thank Matt especially for coming through in the crunch, when I'm bogged down with editing tasks or prepping the next session. There have been a few 11th hour requests, and he's always come through for us. On another note, there will be a slight delay for the next regular installment of THE BIG UNEASY while Bryan and I take a quick jaunt to Ireland! In fact, barring any delays or mechanical failure, we're there...right...now... We'll bust our butts editing the next session after this well-deserved vacation, I promise.
