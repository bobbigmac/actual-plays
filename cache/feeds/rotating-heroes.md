Despite all this, Fraeya will soon find that deep below the forest isn't quite as desolate as it first appeared...

It's a session zero time, so we're going to hear a bit about their characters. Including class, vibe, and names. As well as get to know Jacob and Ally a little better for the uninitiated.
