I thought it in the best interest of the roleplay at the time, to satisfy what the players wanted to do AND move things along since we seemed to be talking over one another, to allow this all to happen. Letting Reyna cast the spell wouldn't satisfy any trust issues, which is what the players were trying to solve. So I just pushed for a way around that even though it's pushing the \"worldly\" boundary. I think this works in that Zone of Truth *can* be cast by bards, meaning it does have capability of use outside of the godly based spells, and that spellcasters in Krynn would have likely found a way to replicate the effects of the spell with this understanding. I should not have used the word \"cleric\" for his magical aide/attendant, but that's what my brain pulled at the time, sorry. ----------------- Background sounds and effects from Syrinscape: https://syrinscape.com/store/551-shadow-of-the-dragon-queen-part-2/ Music Credit: Alexander Nakarada 1.
