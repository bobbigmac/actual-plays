  "description": "The Dominion war is over, Starfleet is slowly rebuilding after the devastation, and the Federation is looking to return to the ways of exploration and peaceful contact. Europa is a brand new, state of the art, Luna class starship with a new Prototype Positronic and Bioneural computer system and an advanced AI. She carries with her, high hopes, and even higher expectations. Starfleet has assigned the best, and the brightest to Europa, and all eyes will be on her as she heads into the Expanse.",

Denni Tolbus is a former Maquis driven into service with the Syndicate after the Dominion eradicated most other Maquis. Denni barely escaped with his life and has only recently managed to work himself out of his indenture to become somewhat trusted. Lupek has been dealing with Denni's boss, an Orion named Mysha. Following this lead, Europa heads to Bish'Ari space, where they encounter a third massive space station, The Bazaar, and a warlord named Jakhari. https://linktr.ee/StudioTembo",

The Federation has officially declared war on the House of Toral but remains uncommitted to the Romulan conflict. Fortunately, the Romulans are more open about their commitments. Admiral Mendek's forces are making progress against those of Pro-Counsul Sela. He has dispatched over a dozen ships to aid Chancellor Martok in finally routing Toral from Quo'nos. He has also appointed Commander Dareeth, a cunning if not reluctant warrior, to take command of all Romulan forces in the Klingon theater. There is still much resistance coming from the House of Toral, but I with the combined effort of the Romulans, Martok, and Starfleet… the end is in sight. In the meantime, I've got a new officer coming aboard… Lt CMD Gerald Moss. He'll be taking over the Flight Operations position. He's got an outstanding record and was highly recommended by Admiral Aralni. He'll manage al shuttle operations and command the Peregrine wing. Https://linktr.ee/StudioTembo",
