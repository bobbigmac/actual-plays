      "description": "Monday 9th February - Penisgate - Rich and Ally are back after their deserved weekend break with all the news that’s fit to talk about. Today it’s the big controversy at the Winter Olympics, wherever that is, and the lengths and widths that male ski jumpers are prepared to go to to win. But is the real story perverted cock-obsessed journalists, which Rich and Ally definitely aren’t? With a live report from the slopes of the Olympics. Wednesday 11th February 2026 - 20-Year-Old Ejaculate - Newsround is back after yesterday’s hiatus when no news happened, but the grown-up news has missed today’s big story, an interview with tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson the man who intends to live forever by going to bed at 8.30pm every night. Just like John Craven in the original Newsround, Rich displays his jealousy of a younger man’s ability to produce gametes, whilst Ally warns of the dangers of eternal life. Exactly like John Craven’s Newsround. Which this is nothing like. Look out for the new titles too. Thanks Andy Bobbin. Thursday 12th February 2026 - Tomato Sauce Science - Rich and Ally are back with some of your comments about the new titles. Well suck it. They discuss new evidence that suggests the Turin Shroud may not be really the shroud of Christ, for all those of you who thought this was wrapped up (no pun intended) already. Do we need evidence to believe in Jesus and isn’t it more important to follow his philosophy? Is St John a liar? Has Ally confused Jesus with Pinocchio? And is Jesus back now, saying wise things? Maybe on a short YouTube video, rather than a mount. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

They chat about the murky story of how the Map Men got together, why they are so many stories around maps, why Richard couldn’t watch Tiswas in Cheddar and how young people don’t know how lucky they are, trying to navigate through London using a map of Paris, how an inset box on a map affected the US/Canada border, the non-existent town that suddenly came into existence (or did it?) navigating by testicles and medieval satnavs. Buy the book here - https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/this-way-up-when-maps-go-wrong-and-why-it-matters-map-men/b6f8a72cb55c007b SUPPORT THE SHOW!

      "description": "#422 P*ssing On Richard - Richard has had his annual cancer check up and it’s mainly good news, but something weird is going on in his scrotum (though he hates to talk about it). His guest is comedian Sarah Keyworth. They talk about the terrible behaviour of the Sheriff of Nottingham, how to explain modern day notions of gender to the old and confused, the previously unexplored positive sides of being in a human centipede, how comedy can help us cope with tragedy and our darkest thoughts, how marriages manage to survive for 40 years, whether Sliding Doors is a great film or definitely isn’t and whether masculinity is defined by stopping a child being hit by a baseball bat. Though there are some serious moments, this is a really skittish and funny chat! Trigger warning - this podcast mentions suicidal thoughts.

      "description": "Newsround Special - Epstein File interview - Always ahead of the grown up news, Richard has procured an interview with the man at the heart of the Epstein Files story, Randy Andy Mountbatten-Windsor-Balmoral. Randrew Andrew explains what’s going on in the pictures with the woman on the ground, why he never met Epstein, why he has too much honour, why he can’t wear shoes and what he was actually doing on the date the new accuser says he was with her. It’s an explosive interview that will surely be shown on all major news channels tonight, thus reigniting Richard’s failed career. Hooray! Tuesday February 3rd 2026 - Eggheads Are People Too - After the explosive interview over the weekend, a regular newsround returns examining the recent statements by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and why he should be judged by his deeds and words and not by his appearance. We have a special interview with a fellow egg-headed celebrity to show just how far egghead prejudice can reach and hopefully help open people’s eyes to this derided condition. Thursday February 5th 2026 - Peanut Pile - After the success of getting Randrew Andrew kicked out of his house, the Newsround team turn their attention to the Prime Minister, whether he can survive and how good a job he is doing. Once again we beat the Lamestream media to a huge exclusive, which you can only get by watching our Craven Newsround. Friday 6th February 2026 - Chinese Hotel Sex Cameras - Newsround is back, despite Rich spending most of the day waiting for his car to be fixed. Ally and he discuss “Eric”, the most hypocritical man in the news at the moment, who was shocked to see he’d been caught on a Chinese Sex Camera, but only because he loved watching videos of people caught on Chinese sex cameras. Who will be caught on the Newsround Sex Camera? Tune in to find out. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

      "description": "RHLSTP Book Club #167 - Life is Rosi - Rich chats to impressionist and actor Jess Robinson about her terrific debut book, (which she describes as Anne Frank meets Bridget Jones), Life is Rosi, an ambitious true story combining the diaries of 20 something Jess with the diaries of her grandmother, Rosi. They discuss the slightly forgotten first stages of the Holocaust where Polish Jews were expelled from Germany in 1938 and how Rosi’s positivity helped her to survive this turbulent period, also the echoes of history that resonate for Jewish people now (even those who are not deemed Jewish enough by Jewish dating services). Plus the similarities and differences between these two young women, the unpleasant things that a hopeful though naive Jess had to endure on her own journey (but how all of us were susceptible to creeps in our younger years), how writing about experiences that we’re uncomfortable about can help others (and ourselves), why Jess wanted to apply for citizenship of a country that had treated her grandmother so badly, the universality of family and how we often fail to learn the lessons of history. Plus the huge technical achievement of combining all these stories and managing to find the humour in it all.

They chat about how Doug got started in comedy, why he gave us the Chicken Song, how Galton and Simpson inspired the writing of Red Dwarf, the difficulty of getting a sci-fi sitcom off the ground and how losing a leg at the age of 7 led to a correspondence with Douglas Bader. They then talk about what inspired Sinbin Island and how it started off about being about aliens, why so many kids books revolve around orphans, the decision to make the story reassuringly old-fashioned and yet still funny and relevant, whether the story is deliberately written to be unfilmable (at least without a huge budget) and if it was inspired by Doug’s own experiences at boarding school. Plus the intriguing Russian nesting dolls and what they say about free will or time travel, but let’s not give too much away.

Herring pitches some gameshow ideas to an unimpressed Osman and attempts to solve the Richard Osman urinal conundrum. They also chat about the strange questions that you get asked at European book events, playing the Royal Albert Hall, whether Osman will still be writing the Thursday Murder Club when he’s in an old folks home, how Herring missed out on the ultimate prize on House of Games. Plus a new Spiderman based emergency question is given short shrift and would you like to live to 150 or more. See RHLSTP live http://richardherring.com/rhlstp SUPPORT THE SHOW!

His guest is comedy legend and unique brained Rich Hall. They talk about why Rich’s appearance (or non-appearance) in a movie is an indicator of its failure, how he started his comedy career on the streets baptising dogs, trying to take that level of performance into clubs, working alongside Seinfeld and Larry David and making up 90 minutes of comedy every morning for David Letterman. How a successful TV appearance become an albatross round his neck, the freedom of coming to the Edinburgh Fringe and recreating national monuments out of cornflake packages, going to a funeral in character and having another success that came with negative effects, what it’s like to be immortalised on the Simpsons and whether being a rebellious, self-sabotaging comedian is possible any more.

They discuss yet another version of the fantastic Meaning of Liff book, this time for the 42nd anniversary of the first publication. They chat about where the idea came from, how John and Douglas Adams happily collaborated on this idea, even after falling out over Hitchhiker’s Guide, whether being bumped out of that project was actually the best thing for John, how money and fame never fill the hole that people who covet them hope it will fill, whether any of the definitions have achieved general acceptance, how John got Hitchhikers Guide on to the TV (even if they quickly shot him off into space), the legendary Not 1982 book that spawned the Meaning of Liff as a book (and Rich proudly brings in the copy of Not 1983 that he won at school) and how laughing til you cry at stupid ideas is one of the joys of comedy collaboration, even if the double act eventually ends in acrimony. Plus the genesis of the News Quiz, how perfectionism can lead to accusations of being difficult, why buying a yacht is a dick move and how John almost died the perfect comedy death.

They discuss Sam being heckled by Herring Junior during the 2025 Fringe (and who is to blame for that), how winning the award will pay for Sam’s wedding, the possible reasons that so many older comedians seem to have jumped on the anti-trans bandwagon and whether the most embarrassing thing about this is how hack their jokes are, why Rich ran out of Sam’s gig, the utterly unthreatening nature of Sam’s audience, how Sam is able to tell stories that highlight the horrible stuff that trans people have to deal with, whilst being self-aware enough to mock her own foolishness and also some fun ghost stories (and sorry that you get to hear the Ernie ghost story again, but you can always fast forward). Plus it’s the first gig Rich has ever done where the action is being relayed on screen for the audience. Is it strictly necessary? See Sam on tour https://www.samnicoresti.com/ SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Is he finally happy now? Or does responsibility for the lives of others come with its own terrors? In his twelfth solo stand up show, Richard examines whether we can ever hope to be or are meant to be truly content. If we were never unhappy would happiness have any meaning? Why do our brains force us to envision the worst possible outcomes even on a day when everything seems fine. How likely is it that Richard's baby will be skewered by a stalactite of frozen urine falling from a plane and is it really worth him wasting his time thinking about it? Does being happy mean a comedian loses his edge and true belly laughs only come from depression? How much pressure was there on Happy the dwarf to live up to his name? Is there any system that will guarantee us eternal bliss or should we just embrace the fact that life is a vale of tears and our only option is to laugh in its face? This DVD was recorded in St David's Hall, Cardiff. It captures a superb performance in front of the biggest audience of Richard's career. for more shows like this, go to gofasterstripe.com Hosted on Acast.

How much did the BBC bosses know and how soon? Why hasn’t it been properly investigated at the Beeb? Was Bashir’s exploitation of Diana’s understandable fears at least partly responsible for her death? Why did the BBC give Bashir a cushy job as late as 2016 when he had already been discredited? What has driven Andy to commit so much time to trying to get to the bottom of it all and why has he met such a wall of resistance? Does Richard’s attendance at St Catherine’s College Oxford mean that he might be involved somehow? Where does mad conspiracy theory end and cover up begin? Maybe only the historians of 500 years time will be able to put all the pieces together, but maybe Prince William will be able to make some headway into the weird goings on in the 1990s and the dodgy behaviour at the BBC.

      "description": "RHLSTP #592 - Smell My Suit - It’s another Leicester Square Theatre podcast and Rich is wondering if he’s already got to the point where his kids are funnier than him (low bar). His guest is the multi-talented and almost ubiquitous Paul F Tompkins. They chat about the practical drawbacks of acting with a claw, why Mr Peanut Butter in Bojack Horseman has the same voice as Paul, the unique confidence of starting stand-up at 17 and assuming you’re the best, why Paul wears a suit on stage and whether Rich should check it for freshness, the amazing Beatles-like fandom behind the long running show The Thrilling Adventure Hour and how Paul has successfully bridged old and new comedy in what he does, whether it’s better to be in one episode of everything or all episodes of one thing, an exemplary display of how to answer emergency questions and one of the possible reasons why Richard isn’t a more successful actor.

They chat about the disconnect between Victoria’s teenage angst and then partying with Frankie Howerd, the worst celebrity poker players, why the coughing Major should have gone for anal beads, how Victoria charmingly manages to lose money doing her Radio 4 show, how it’s possible that she didn’t learn to ride a bike as a child, the possible arrogance of the producers of Mary Poppins, the statue that made Victoria cry. Plus are the cracks starting to show in the Coren-Mitchell marriage? (or can the tabloids manage to spin this conversation to make it appear that they are?).

Then they discuss the long gestation period of the book and the rock opera and why it was important that for all the magic of the writing that the project was scientific, how it manages to make points about the environment and extinction without detracting from the story, whether it would be preferable to live in a world without dogs or without humans, why the ultimate goal is to create a work that can be enjoyed by all members of a family and why it’s good to use language and music that pushes the reader of listener and doesn’t patronise them.

They chat about the parallels between Nazi Germany and other more recent political developments, the surprising group of people who resisted Hitler in varying degrees and the complicity of the vast majority. How one of the characters in the story was at the heart of development of mass extermination and how others were willing to go along with mass murder, the incredible luck that Hitler enjoyed in the various assassination plots that he survived, the fervour with which his supporters continued his work, even as their enemy was at the gates and how there is no justice for the traitor at the heart of the circle. Plus how in spite of the horror of the subject, the bravery and rebellion of the people who opposed the regime is an incredible positive and what effect does a subject like this have on the author.

Richard’s guest is not in Oasis and is unlikely to support them after this, it’s the loquacious (thank goodness for Rich) Nish Kumar. They chat about at what point you have to stop claiming to be working class, how Nish survived his tour of America unscathed and the positives he took from the experience, why both sides-ism is an unhelpful concept, how even Nish’s grandma thinks he might be Jason Mantzoukas, why Taskmaster is didn’t too badly when it comes to diversity, but how being in a comedy gang can be a big help in maintaining the necessary quality for a career and has Nish been in a canoe? This is the only podcast where you will find out. Thanks so much to the magnificent staff at the Stand in Edinburgh and the brilliant audiences that made this Fringe an absolute pleasure.

Find out how a triangle solved a pig murder, what it’s like to very briefly be the most recently published maths author and to see the work of the earliest known maths author first hand, how triangles can tell us the size of the planet or how far away a space probe is, whether bees know they are making hexagons, how Rich’s dad used one of the world’s first computers (though wasn’t aware of sex workers), how to cut a sandwich into three equal bits and what comedy and mathematics have in common. Plus how Rich might have been a mathematician himself, but now doesn’t even know calculus is for.

Is it horror or literary fiction? is it important for people writing about dark subjects to have three names? What attracted Andrew to writing about dilapidated seaside resorts - and has he ever been to Weston-super-Mare? How does he make his novels so atmospheric? What’s it like getting a quote from Stephen King? Plus Andrew’s remarkable leap to success (after only ten years of work) and how a 300 book print run led to a hugely successful first novel, Richard reveals how little he knows about Gothic novels (or what they even are), how we are all haunted by the mistakes we've made in life and how the contemplation of our own mortality can drive so much of our lives. Does writing a creepy book mean you can’t escape the subject in your downtime? Lots of questions, but thankfully some answers too!

      "description": "#410 Saggy-Faced Satsuma - Richard has narrowly avoided a dinosaur based disaster, but never mind because a RHLSTP favourite is returning - the incomparable Bob Mortimer. They talk about holding dominion over the animals, whether questions are necessary in an interview, what prompted Bob to write his first novel and whether satsumas are the best small orange fruit, the adoration for Bob and Paul that the team behind Gone Fishing clearly have, why a double act of two nice men works, what it’s like being below average height, aspiring to watch TV, the treatment centre for phone addiction and how to take down coniferous trees. Also how many Bob Mortimers might there be out there and why his book imagines an alternate world for him? Bob has also brought along his joke book for emergencies.

      "description": "RHLSTP Book Club #156 - Fires Which Burned Brightly - None of your tat this week on the book podcast with the genius that is Sebastian Faulks, but test one is how will he react to Richard’s alternative title for this collection of essays that form a loose autobiography! Once we’ve over that hill, it’s plain sailing as they discuss how much the world has changed in the last few decades, the ethics of sending an 8 year old to boarding school, the glory days of journalism and mental illness. Is Richard still in a dream that started 25 years ago? How much research goes into a book like Birdsong? What is the motivation for writing books continuing the stories of James Bond and Jeeves and Wooster (not in the same books!)? Plus a discussion of 20th century toilet paper. Sebastian Faulks is the author of Fires Which Burned Brightly: A Life in Progress (Hutchinson Heinemann £20, out now). He is appearing at the Southbank London Literature Festival on 29 October.

They talk about her fantastic new independent film, Sunlight, how it’s a dark love story about a suicidal man, a woman in a monkey suit and an attempt to dig up a grave to recover a $20,000 dollar watch, but so much more than that. How the idea and the real life love began in the middle of a 50 hour improv session, the dangers of going under water in a monkey suit, how the film might appeal to Furries, how it could never be written by AI and why you should definitely see it. Plus how Nina ended up in Spinal Tap 2 and a good indication of why Richard didn’t, how ventriloquist dummies become their own people (or monkeys), the dark past of ventriloquists and whether Nina resents her monkey. Nina's directorial debut film 'Sunlight' will have a UK theatrical release from 18th October 2025 (screening details here ), or you can pre-order it on Apple TV here (UK) and here (Ireland) - available digitally from 28th November 2025.

Richard’s guest is the brilliant actor and writer and also his ex-girlfriend, Sally Phillips. They talk about the girl who smelled of spam and Sally’s impressive performance in the film “How To Please A Woman”, but they can’t avoid the elephant in the room and discuss there somewhat different memories of the break up of their relationship (and at least one of hers confuses a sketch with reality, but what is truth?) and how this impacted on their Edinburgh shows (and lives). Can they reach a place of forgiveness for their behaviour? Also Sally’s side of the Princess Diana love triangle, how being in a comedy gang in the 1990s gave us all too much confidence, how she got the job in Alan Partridge, what led to her working with Mr Tumble and speculation on why Hugh Grant doesn’t talk to her. Also the impact of disablist language (and an appearance from her son, Ol), grabbing the reins of power, being careful what you wish for, Dexter Fletcher and a tension that makes this one of the greatest and funniest RHLSTPs ever.

Also the scandalous grifting and Romanov style spending and waste, the Epstein files and the many reasons why more of the victims have not come forward, how easy it is to discover the lies that Andrew has told and the truth about the famous photo, whether Andrew lives in fear after writing a book like this, whether the monarchy can survive this scandal and how much more there is to come out. Also what it says about the way business is run in the world and the utter stupidity and depravity of so many (usually men) in important positions who didn’t seem to realise that they were being trapped and could be blackmailed. Also the truth behind the Newsnight interview and who really did the work for it and how Andrew was stupid enough to think it had gone well.

They chat about being locked out of flats, broken cat-flaps, the year of the Herring and how much O2 paid to sponsor RHLSTP (in the golden era), Tim’s appearance in the new Greg Daniels sitcom The Paper and Robert Popper’s part in getting him there, 5k times and the pathetic money-making crimes that Richard never got caught for in 1989 (if you were one of the students he took to HMS Victory please get in touch for your rebate).

Richard is still talking (though mainly listening) to comedy legend Bernie Clifton. Finally we’re getting to Bernie’s TV career and cultural references that might be understood by anyone under 85. Remember that Bernie is 89 years old and this podcast (along with last week’s) was recorded all in one go. And I reckon he had another two hours in him if we didn’t have to go home. He talks about his appearances on Crown Court, singing XTC songs on Crackerjack, how he survived the wave of alternative comedy that scuppered some of his contemporaries, how he ended up on The Voice and returned to his first love of singing and who his biggest comedy hero was. There’s more mayhem and poetry and not enough time to talk about any of the things Richard wanted to. But man, what a beautiful, joyful, amazing man and what a phenomenal memory (and bladder).

Chat includes the Irish James Bond, how Stephen Hawking ruined Terminator, the likelihood of Richard speaking fluent Spanish for the rest of his life and the impact of that on the theories of Infinite Universes, sending robots into space (and what happens the night before they go), depriving a comedian of an audience for two years, why Richard will never present Going for Gold and what he’d insist upon if he was at the helm of Blockbusters and to be honest such a depth and pace of comedy that you are going to need to listen on half speed to catch it all.

Richard is star struck to have the man who talks to him every morning actually answer back, but still manages to discuss the genesis of the idea, the organic way it gained popularity, why cryptic crosswords and jokes share similarities, the clamour to turn the idea into a book, why it works so well in book form too and why it’s a bad idea to do cryptic crosswords in a stand up comedy set.

And it’s a couple of great weeks coming up for anyone who thinks Richard talks too much. Bernie takes us through his early days growing up in poverty, nearly getting killed by the Nazis and leaving school to deliver bread. He also talks about being the world’s worst plumber, how National Service changed his life and starting out as a singer. Plus the huge star who diverted him towards the prop-comedy that would make him famous, a decade or more of working the clubs and can Rich persuade Bernie to talk about the ostrich. I am not so sure. One hour in with 53 more years to cover. Buckle up. A podcast that really proves it’s worth coming to see these shows live!

There’s some great chat about changing attitudes to individuality, plus the comedic process, how surreal comedy is a rare skill and staying true to yourself, plus Andrew having to do a 90s style Edinburgh show because they broke their leg and have been on morphine, playing Jongleurs without compromising your act, the joy of connecting with one (and only one) audience member and how it’s disappointing that TV just doesn’t take a punt on interesting comedians any more.

      "description": "RHLSTP #571 - Cheddar Gorge Jimmy Saviles - Richard is back at the Bill Murray in Islington with another act heading up to the Edinburgh Fringe, the brilliant Chloe Petts. They talk about disgusting farts, hypnotic breasts and the power of football to unite strangers, so pretty much the same topics as every other podcast in the world, but with a bit more/less class (delete as applicable). Also discussed: Is a Hitler salute ever appropriate in a comedy context? why does every culture insist on imagining vaginas with teeth? Is it offensive to be misgendered? What would happen in a body swap film involving a tall person and a short person? Does everyone secretly want to eat dog biscuits? Why has chemotherapy ruined root vegetables for Richard and is Ed Gamble the monster that Richard hopes him to be on tour?

They discuss the formation of this hub of comedy creativity and Richard’s part in it (not that he remembers), which Bill Murray it’s named after and what they will do if the other Bill Murray ever turns up. Barry chats about his Edinburgh Fringe show “My Seven Years as Lionel Richie” https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/barry-ferns-my-seven-years-as-lionel-richie and the many other self-destructive comedic decisions he has made, how Edinburgh left him bankrupt and homeless, how he convinced tourists they could go inside Arthur’s Seat and how his commitment to the bit led to him losing paid employment. In many ways he is a fucking idiot, but a glorious one.

They chat about how someone from Hertfordshire has ended up writing such an authentic book about America in the 20th Century, his writing process and why he spent a year just writing dialogue between the main characters, how you approach writing about dark subjects such as child abduction and murder in a respectful way, whether he was inspired by the X Files for one character in particular and Chris still works in Bishops Stortford library. Chris also talks very openly about his own troubled childhood and how this has informed the novel, but also led to him becoming a writer and how surreal journey of having bestselling novels, meeting Presidents and getting this book made into a huge TV series.

They chat about Paul’s incredible 59 year career, from working mens’ clubs and routines with Charlie Cairoli, through talent shows and learning the craft to the big break with Chuckle Vision. What injuries did the boys have to endure for comedy? What was it like to be so recognisable? How did the distinctive Chuckle look develop? And how did they come up with the iconic To Me, To You. Plus working with Tinchy Strider and moving into DJing. Paul talks movingly about losing his brother/partner and best friend and why he needed to carry on working. And finally the truth about his moped accident. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

      "description": "RHLSTP Book Club 134 - The Invisible Doctrine - Recorded in front of an audience at the prestigious Royal Geographical Society, Richard talks to journalist George Monbiot about his very readable investigation into Neo-Liberalism (co-authored with Peter Hutchinson) The Invisible Doctrine. George does most of the talking, which is probably for the best and reveals what he considers to the be the starting point of capitalism, why capitalism and commerce are not the same thing, the roots of Neo Liberalism in the closing stages of World War II, why it took 30 years to come to prominence, conspiracy theories versus conspiracy fictions, why the left has missed opportunities to defeat Neo-liberalism, what happened when Liz Truss tried to institute its policies all in one go, why Starmer is wrong to try and legitimise Reform and whether there is hope for the future and what we can do to stand up to a political system that threatens our planet. Rousing and fascinating stuff.

At the end of last year, myself, Matt Forde and Mark Steel sat down to have a frank, raw, funny and open conversation about something that has affected us all - cancer.

Rich and Marc talk about how little people know about this period and how most of the things they do know never happened, why having very few sources to work from doesn’t make this light and easy work, how Marc discovered the best way to cover this sprawling and tumultuous half a millennium was to tell it through the stories of various individuals and why unfortunately all these individuals had to be male, why the Venerable Bede is good if you have an ill cow, but not always so good if you want the facts of what happened, which Anglo Saxon king allegedly shat in the font at his baptism, which king had a threesome with his wife and her mum and which king came close to becoming a cropper in Cheddar Gorge. Plus the skill required to combine academia with readability and whether comedians and historians would have survived the departure of the Romans and the arrival of the Vikings (no they wouldn’t).

Although Chris says it’s not Top Trumps his cancer makes Richard’s look like a paper cut and the book is bold and matter of fact about the impact of a non-sugar coated stage 4 cancer diagnosis, but whilst acknowledging the spiral of grief that this inevitably caused, Chris discusses the catharsis of writing about it, applying sports psychology to the situation and seeing the positives of life rather than constantly worrying about death, which could come to any of us at any time. He talks about his own particular deeply unpleasant chemotherapy and the reasons he endured it and how he got through it, how comedy can help us through and how he hopes he might be around for a while yet. Plus how he coped with life after the Olympic victory and trying to avoid Alan Partridgisms. And how making the most of life isn’t just about bucket lists, but realising what matters in your life and how lucky we are to be here.

If like Richard you only know Bergson as a punchline to a Monty Python sketch then you will get to know a lot more about this unassuming and shy man who achieved rock star status as a philosopher. Rich and Emily chat about the Bergson’s respect for laughter and comedy, his fascination and sympathy with spiritualism, how he revolutionised philosophy and why he just as quickly faded from view, his death-bed lecture and the fellow lecturer who had his own talks disrupted by Bergson’s legions of fans.

They chat about why he left the world of accountancy behind to become a stand-up, resisting the temptations of post gig debauchery to go home and change nappies, skiing with Tara Palmer-Tompkinson, climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, how he felt when he was unceremoniously dumped from his long-running radio show, why he’s still gigging in his sixties, the only two words that Billy Connolly ever said to Fred and running naked through a field with Al Murray.

Should Richard with his 2:1 in history have know about more of them than he does? Perhaps. They chat about why women (and non-royalty generally) are so badly represented in history, how history is more fun if you’re allowed to be judgemental about the clearly horrible stuff, how even stories from as recently at the 60s show how pervasive certain ideas of women can be, how Eleanor chose her 18 people/groups to write about and how the book is more serious than one might have expected (but still has plenty of funny stuff in it too).

Plus what it’s like to be in the brain of Richard Ayoade, why he wanted to create the character of Harold Hughes, why he put himself in the book, the joy of a book that it takes a little while to tune into, another incredible audiobook and how to create parody that occasionally transcends humour, but where you come to care for the people you are mocking. How has he been allowed to do this? He definitely should have been allowed to do it, but it’s still amazing that he’s done it and that it’s available for you to read!
