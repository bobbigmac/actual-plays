      "description": "Monday 9th February - Penisgate - Rich and Ally are back after their deserved weekend break with all the news that’s fit to talk about. Today it’s the big controversy at the Winter Olympics, wherever that is, and the lengths and widths that male ski jumpers are prepared to go to to win. But is the real story perverted cock-obsessed journalists, which Rich and Ally definitely aren’t? With a live report from the slopes of the Olympics. Wednesday 11th February 2026 - 20-Year-Old Ejaculate - Newsround is back after yesterday’s hiatus when no news happened, but the grown-up news has missed today’s big story, an interview with tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson the man who intends to live forever by going to bed at 8.30pm every night. Just like John Craven in the original Newsround, Rich displays his jealousy of a younger man’s ability to produce gametes, whilst Ally warns of the dangers of eternal life. Exactly like John Craven’s Newsround. Which this is nothing like. Look out for the new titles too. Thanks Andy Bobbin. Thursday 12th February 2026 - Tomato Sauce Science - Rich and Ally are back with some of your comments about the new titles. Well suck it. They discuss new evidence that suggests the Turin Shroud may not be really the shroud of Christ, for all those of you who thought this was wrapped up (no pun intended) already. Do we need evidence to believe in Jesus and isn’t it more important to follow his philosophy? Is St John a liar? Has Ally confused Jesus with Pinocchio? And is Jesus back now, saying wise things? Maybe on a short YouTube video, rather than a mount. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

They chat about the murky story of how the Map Men got together, why they are so many stories around maps, why Richard couldn’t watch Tiswas in Cheddar and how young people don’t know how lucky they are, trying to navigate through London using a map of Paris, how an inset box on a map affected the US/Canada border, the non-existent town that suddenly came into existence (or did it?) navigating by testicles and medieval satnavs. Buy the book here - https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/this-way-up-when-maps-go-wrong-and-why-it-matters-map-men/b6f8a72cb55c007b SUPPORT THE SHOW!

      "description": "#422 P*ssing On Richard - Richard has had his annual cancer check up and it’s mainly good news, but something weird is going on in his scrotum (though he hates to talk about it). His guest is comedian Sarah Keyworth. They talk about the terrible behaviour of the Sheriff of Nottingham, how to explain modern day notions of gender to the old and confused, the previously unexplored positive sides of being in a human centipede, how comedy can help us cope with tragedy and our darkest thoughts, how marriages manage to survive for 40 years, whether Sliding Doors is a great film or definitely isn’t and whether masculinity is defined by stopping a child being hit by a baseball bat. Though there are some serious moments, this is a really skittish and funny chat! Trigger warning - this podcast mentions suicidal thoughts.

      "description": "Newsround Special - Epstein File interview - Always ahead of the grown up news, Richard has procured an interview with the man at the heart of the Epstein Files story, Randy Andy Mountbatten-Windsor-Balmoral. Randrew Andrew explains what’s going on in the pictures with the woman on the ground, why he never met Epstein, why he has too much honour, why he can’t wear shoes and what he was actually doing on the date the new accuser says he was with her. It’s an explosive interview that will surely be shown on all major news channels tonight, thus reigniting Richard’s failed career. Hooray! Tuesday February 3rd 2026 - Eggheads Are People Too - After the explosive interview over the weekend, a regular newsround returns examining the recent statements by FIFA President Gianni Infantino and why he should be judged by his deeds and words and not by his appearance. We have a special interview with a fellow egg-headed celebrity to show just how far egghead prejudice can reach and hopefully help open people’s eyes to this derided condition. Thursday February 5th 2026 - Peanut Pile - After the success of getting Randrew Andrew kicked out of his house, the Newsround team turn their attention to the Prime Minister, whether he can survive and how good a job he is doing. Once again we beat the Lamestream media to a huge exclusive, which you can only get by watching our Craven Newsround. Friday 6th February 2026 - Chinese Hotel Sex Cameras - Newsround is back, despite Rich spending most of the day waiting for his car to be fixed. Ally and he discuss “Eric”, the most hypocritical man in the news at the moment, who was shocked to see he’d been caught on a Chinese Sex Camera, but only because he loved watching videos of people caught on Chinese sex cameras. Who will be caught on the Newsround Sex Camera? Tune in to find out. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

They discuss the difficulties of producing a good succinct joke, how rarely Richard manages it, how the language used can serve as a hidden copyright sign in the DNA of the thing and what can be done if someone nicks a good one to make into a greetings card. Plus the perils of being the support act for a sore-throated Seann Walsh, whether the man at Pret fancied or pitied Richard, living with a poltergeist and the importance of giving your audience something to laugh at.

      "description": "RHLSTP Book Club #167 - Life is Rosi - Rich chats to impressionist and actor Jess Robinson about her terrific debut book, (which she describes as Anne Frank meets Bridget Jones), Life is Rosi, an ambitious true story combining the diaries of 20 something Jess with the diaries of her grandmother, Rosi. They discuss the slightly forgotten first stages of the Holocaust where Polish Jews were expelled from Germany in 1938 and how Rosi’s positivity helped her to survive this turbulent period, also the echoes of history that resonate for Jewish people now (even those who are not deemed Jewish enough by Jewish dating services). Plus the similarities and differences between these two young women, the unpleasant things that a hopeful though naive Jess had to endure on her own journey (but how all of us were susceptible to creeps in our younger years), how writing about experiences that we’re uncomfortable about can help others (and ourselves), why Jess wanted to apply for citizenship of a country that had treated her grandmother so badly, the universality of family and how we often fail to learn the lessons of history. Plus the huge technical achievement of combining all these stories and managing to find the humour in it all.

They chat about how Doug got started in comedy, why he gave us the Chicken Song, how Galton and Simpson inspired the writing of Red Dwarf, the difficulty of getting a sci-fi sitcom off the ground and how losing a leg at the age of 7 led to a correspondence with Douglas Bader. They then talk about what inspired Sinbin Island and how it started off about being about aliens, why so many kids books revolve around orphans, the decision to make the story reassuringly old-fashioned and yet still funny and relevant, whether the story is deliberately written to be unfilmable (at least without a huge budget) and if it was inspired by Doug’s own experiences at boarding school. Plus the intriguing Russian nesting dolls and what they say about free will or time travel, but let’s not give too much away.

His guest is comedy legend and unique brained Rich Hall. They talk about why Rich’s appearance (or non-appearance) in a movie is an indicator of its failure, how he started his comedy career on the streets baptising dogs, trying to take that level of performance into clubs, working alongside Seinfeld and Larry David and making up 90 minutes of comedy every morning for David Letterman. How a successful TV appearance become an albatross round his neck, the freedom of coming to the Edinburgh Fringe and recreating national monuments out of cornflake packages, going to a funeral in character and having another success that came with negative effects, what it’s like to be immortalised on the Simpsons and whether being a rebellious, self-sabotaging comedian is possible any more.

They chat about where the idea came from, how John and Douglas Adams happily collaborated on this idea, even after falling out over Hitchhiker’s Guide, whether being bumped out of that project was actually the best thing for John, how money and fame never fill the hole that people who covet them hope it will fill, whether any of the definitions have achieved general acceptance, how John got Hitchhikers Guide on to the TV (even if they quickly shot him off into space), the legendary Not 1982 book that spawned the Meaning of Liff as a book (and Rich proudly brings in the copy of Not 1983 that he won at school) and how laughing til you cry at stupid ideas is one of the joys of comedy collaboration, even if the double act eventually ends in acrimony. Plus the genesis of the News Quiz, how perfectionism can lead to accusations of being difficult, why buying a yacht is a dick move and how John almost died the perfect comedy death.

His guest is the Edinburgh Comedy Prize winner Sam Nicoresti. They discuss Sam being heckled by Herring Junior during the 2025 Fringe (and who is to blame for that), how winning the award will pay for Sam’s wedding, the possible reasons that so many older comedians seem to have jumped on the anti-trans bandwagon and whether the most embarrassing thing about this is how hack their jokes are, why Rich ran out of Sam’s gig, the utterly unthreatening nature of Sam’s audience, how Sam is able to tell stories that highlight the horrible stuff that trans people have to deal with, whilst being self-aware enough to mock her own foolishness and also some fun ghost stories (and sorry that you get to hear the Ernie ghost story again, but you can always fast forward). Plus it’s the first gig Rich has ever done where the action is being relayed on screen for the audience. Is it strictly necessary? See Sam on tour https://www.samnicoresti.com/ SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Is he finally happy now? Or does responsibility for the lives of others come with its own terrors? In his twelfth solo stand up show, Richard examines whether we can ever hope to be or are meant to be truly content. If we were never unhappy would happiness have any meaning? Why do our brains force us to envision the worst possible outcomes even on a day when everything seems fine. How likely is it that Richard's baby will be skewered by a stalactite of frozen urine falling from a plane and is it really worth him wasting his time thinking about it? Does being happy mean a comedian loses his edge and true belly laughs only come from depression? How much pressure was there on Happy the dwarf to live up to his name? Is there any system that will guarantee us eternal bliss or should we just embrace the fact that life is a vale of tears and our only option is to laugh in its face? This DVD was recorded in St David's Hall, Cardiff. It captures a superb performance in front of the biggest audience of Richard's career. for more shows like this, go to gofasterstripe.com Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "RHLSTP Book Club #164 - Dianarama - Richard chats to journalist and documentary maker Andy Webb about his exhaustively researched (and lived) book Dianarama which is about the Martin Bashir interview with Princess Diana and the lies and subterfuge that were required to get it and the alleged cover up at the BBC that followed. How much did the BBC bosses know and how soon? Why hasn’t it been properly investigated at the Beeb? Was Bashir’s exploitation of Diana’s understandable fears at least partly responsible for her death? Why did the BBC give Bashir a cushy job as late as 2016 when he had already been discredited? What has driven Andy to commit so much time to trying to get to the bottom of it all and why has he met such a wall of resistance? Does Richard’s attendance at St Catherine’s College Oxford mean that he might be involved somehow? Where does mad conspiracy theory end and cover up begin? Maybe only the historians of 500 years time will be able to put all the pieces together, but maybe Prince William will be able to make some headway into the weird goings on in the 1990s and the dodgy behaviour at the BBC.

His guest is the multi-talented and almost ubiquitous Paul F Tompkins. They chat about the practical drawbacks of acting with a claw, why Mr Peanut Butter in Bojack Horseman has the same voice as Paul, the unique confidence of starting stand-up at 17 and assuming you’re the best, why Paul wears a suit on stage and whether Rich should check it for freshness, the amazing Beatles-like fandom behind the long running show The Thrilling Adventure Hour and how Paul has successfully bridged old and new comedy in what he does, whether it’s better to be in one episode of everything or all episodes of one thing, an exemplary display of how to answer emergency questions and one of the possible reasons why Richard isn’t a more successful actor.

They chat about the disconnect between Victoria’s teenage angst and then partying with Frankie Howerd, the worst celebrity poker players, why the coughing Major should have gone for anal beads, how Victoria charmingly manages to lose money doing her Radio 4 show, how it’s possible that she didn’t learn to ride a bike as a child, the possible arrogance of the producers of Mary Poppins, the statue that made Victoria cry. Plus are the cracks starting to show in the Coren-Mitchell marriage? (or can the tabloids manage to spin this conversation to make it appear that they are?).

Then they discuss the long gestation period of the book and the rock opera and why it was important that for all the magic of the writing that the project was scientific, how it manages to make points about the environment and extinction without detracting from the story, whether it would be preferable to live in a world without dogs or without humans, why the ultimate goal is to create a work that can be enjoyed by all members of a family and why it’s good to use language and music that pushes the reader of listener and doesn’t patronise them.

They chat about the parallels between Nazi Germany and other more recent political developments, the surprising group of people who resisted Hitler in varying degrees and the complicity of the vast majority. How one of the characters in the story was at the heart of development of mass extermination and how others were willing to go along with mass murder, the incredible luck that Hitler enjoyed in the various assassination plots that he survived, the fervour with which his supporters continued his work, even as their enemy was at the gates and how there is no justice for the traitor at the heart of the circle. Plus how in spite of the horror of the subject, the bravery and rebellion of the people who opposed the regime is an incredible positive and what effect does a subject like this have on the author.

      "description": "RHLSTP #589 - Dopplegängr - It’s Richard’s last show of the 2025 Edinburgh Fringe, but what is the Edinburgh Fringe? Luckily Liam Gallagher knows. Richard’s guest is not in Oasis and is unlikely to support them after this, it’s the loquacious (thank goodness for Rich) Nish Kumar. They chat about at what point you have to stop claiming to be working class, how Nish survived his tour of America unscathed and the positives he took from the experience, why both sides-ism is an unhelpful concept, how even Nish’s grandma thinks he might be Jason Mantzoukas, why Taskmaster is didn’t too badly when it comes to diversity, but how being in a comedy gang can be a big help in maintaining the necessary quality for a career and has Nish been in a canoe? This is the only podcast where you will find out. Thanks so much to the magnificent staff at the Stand in Edinburgh and the brilliant audiences that made this Fringe an absolute pleasure. Same time again next year? SUPPORT THE SHOW!

His guest is the king of mischief and righteous anger (who is also very funny) Joe Lycett. They talk about how Joe brought down a Prime Minister, how he was almost arrested for a joke, how his spoof Sue Gray report fooled some members of parliament, how people decided what snacks Santa would be getting, the personal heartbreak behind Joe’s anger about the government’s reaction to Covid, why he literally talked sh*t and the extreme steps Joe is taking to try and persuade David Beckham to withdraw from his role in Qatar.

They chat about getting the fabulous Andy Serkis to do the audiobook (and why Adam was reluctant to do it himself), how Adam has lots of fans in the 8-12 year age group (including Rich’s daughter) but how this is definitely not a book for them, the delicate balance of writing a whodunnit where it’s possible, but not easy, to guess the who whodunnit, how Adam weaves in some serious issues into this very funny book, how welcome is having a gay protagonist where their sexuality is more or less by the by, the classism and other issues that still pervade the NHS, dealing with mental health and the importance of actually being funny in a funny book. The book is a lot of fun and also involves corpses bottoms and dominatrices and proper jokes.

Is it horror or literary fiction? is it important for people writing about dark subjects to have three names? What attracted Andrew to writing about dilapidated seaside resorts - and has he ever been to Weston-super-Mare? How does he make his novels so atmospheric? What’s it like getting a quote from Stephen King? Plus Andrew’s remarkable leap to success (after only ten years of work) and how a 300 book print run led to a hugely successful first novel, Richard reveals how little he knows about Gothic novels (or what they even are), how we are all haunted by the mistakes we've made in life and how the contemplation of our own mortality can drive so much of our lives. Does writing a creepy book mean you can’t escape the subject in your downtime? Lots of questions, but thankfully some answers too!

They chat about what attracted Mark to this subject, whether he was worried about telling a story from the perspective of a Croatian food deliverer, how modern society can be compared to the life of insects, how love or sexual attraction can come at you fast, even when (or especially when) you know it’s doomed or dangerous, whether it’s best to get your first draft out in one go or take your time over revisions, why you sometimes have to let your characters dictate the action and change your ending and the difficult job of building up tension and making sure the denouement justifies the journey.

Rich couldn’t possibly comment. But does anyway. His guest is the reigning Edinburgh Award Best Newcome Joe Kent-Walters aka Frankie Monroe. They chat about how his show seems to build on previous comedians work to create something useful, how Frankie ended up with Sudocrem on his face and what the consequences of that might be, whether Rich was bored during Joe’s show (he wasn’t - it was very exciting to witness), meeting Bobby Davro, why a lackadaisical attitude towards ventriloquism is the best, how a character on stage has a confidence that the performer might not have in real life, the Yorkshire mafia and what happens if you leave your Gammon hammer on the train.

They talk about holding dominion over the animals, whether questions are necessary in an interview, what prompted Bob to write his first novel and whether satsumas are the best small orange fruit, the adoration for Bob and Paul that the team behind Gone Fishing clearly have, why a double act of two nice men works, what it’s like being below average height, aspiring to watch TV, the treatment centre for phone addiction and how to take down coniferous trees. Also how many Bob Mortimers might there be out there and why his book imagines an alternate world for him? Bob has also brought along his joke book for emergencies.

Once we’ve over that hill, it’s plain sailing as they discuss how much the world has changed in the last few decades, the ethics of sending an 8 year old to boarding school, the glory days of journalism and mental illness. Is Richard still in a dream that started 25 years ago? How much research goes into a book like Birdsong? What is the motivation for writing books continuing the stories of James Bond and Jeeves and Wooster (not in the same books!)? Plus a discussion of 20th century toilet paper. Sebastian Faulks is the author of Fires Which Burned Brightly: A Life in Progress (Hutchinson Heinemann £20, out now). He is appearing at the Southbank London Literature Festival on 29 October.

They talk about her fantastic new independent film, Sunlight, how it’s a dark love story about a suicidal man, a woman in a monkey suit and an attempt to dig up a grave to recover a $20,000 dollar watch, but so much more than that. How the idea and the real life love began in the middle of a 50 hour improv session, the dangers of going under water in a monkey suit, how the film might appeal to Furries, how it could never be written by AI and why you should definitely see it. Plus how Nina ended up in Spinal Tap 2 and a good indication of why Richard didn’t, how ventriloquist dummies become their own people (or monkeys), the dark past of ventriloquists and whether Nina resents her monkey. Nina's directorial debut film 'Sunlight' will have a UK theatrical release from 18th October 2025 (screening details here ), or you can pre-order it on Apple TV here (UK) and here (Ireland) - available digitally from 28th November 2025.

Richard’s guest is the brilliant actor and writer and also his ex-girlfriend, Sally Phillips. They talk about the girl who smelled of spam and Sally’s impressive performance in the film “How To Please A Woman”, but they can’t avoid the elephant in the room and discuss there somewhat different memories of the break up of their relationship (and at least one of hers confuses a sketch with reality, but what is truth?) and how this impacted on their Edinburgh shows (and lives). Can they reach a place of forgiveness for their behaviour? Also Sally’s side of the Princess Diana love triangle, how being in a comedy gang in the 1990s gave us all too much confidence, how she got the job in Alan Partridge, what led to her working with Mr Tumble and speculation on why Hugh Grant doesn’t talk to her. Also the impact of disablist language (and an appearance from her son, Ol), grabbing the reins of power, being careful what you wish for, Dexter Fletcher and a tension that makes this one of the greatest and funniest RHLSTPs ever.

They chat about the process of getting this book to print and the surprises and revelations that are sometimes quite casually dropped in, how it’s easy to feel sorry for Andrew for his bizarre childhood where he had no boundaries, but harder to feel sorry for him when you read all the stupid, selfish and criminal things he has done as an adult. Also the scandalous grifting and Romanov style spending and waste, the Epstein files and the many reasons why more of the victims have not come forward, how easy it is to discover the lies that Andrew has told and the truth about the famous photo, whether Andrew lives in fear after writing a book like this, whether the monarchy can survive this scandal and how much more there is to come out. Also what it says about the way business is run in the world and the utter stupidity and depravity of so many (usually men) in important positions who didn’t seem to realise that they were being trapped and could be blackmailed. Also the truth behind the Newsnight interview and who really did the work for it and how Andrew was stupid enough to think it had gone well. Plus the many instances where he found himself able to sweat. This is an extraordinary book which you really should read.

They chat about being locked out of flats, broken cat-flaps, the year of the Herring and how much O2 paid to sponsor RHLSTP (in the golden era), Tim’s appearance in the new Greg Daniels sitcom The Paper and Robert Popper’s part in getting him there, 5k times and the pathetic money-making crimes that Richard never got caught for in 1989 (if you were one of the students he took to HMS Victory please get in touch for your rebate). Plus selling Dawn French a yoyo and nearly killing Michael Palin. It’s another classic Key:Herring collaboration, awkward, weird, boring and funny enough to almost make Richard pass out.

      "description": "RHLSTP #578 - Ken Dodd’s Tollbooth Baguette - We’re back at the Crossed Wire Festival in Sheffield and you’ve had some time to relax and go to the toilet, but the audience haven’t. Richard is still talking (though mainly listening) to comedy legend Bernie Clifton. Finally we’re getting to Bernie’s TV career and cultural references that might be understood by anyone under 85. Remember that Bernie is 89 years old and this podcast (along with last week’s) was recorded all in one go. And I reckon he had another two hours in him if we didn’t have to go home. He talks about his appearances on Crown Court, singing XTC songs on Crackerjack, how he survived the wave of alternative comedy that scuppered some of his contemporaries, how he ended up on The Voice and returned to his first love of singing and who his biggest comedy hero was. There’s more mayhem and poetry and not enough time to talk about any of the things Richard wanted to. But man, what a beautiful, joyful, amazing man and what a phenomenal memory (and bladder).

And it’s a couple of great weeks coming up for anyone who thinks Richard talks too much. Bernie takes us through his early days growing up in poverty, nearly getting killed by the Nazis and leaving school to deliver bread. He also talks about being the world’s worst plumber, how National Service changed his life and starting out as a singer. Plus the huge star who diverted him towards the prop-comedy that would make him famous, a decade or more of working the clubs and can Rich persuade Bernie to talk about the ostrich. I am not so sure.

There’s some great chat about changing attitudes to individuality, plus the comedic process, how surreal comedy is a rare skill and staying true to yourself, plus Andrew having to do a 90s style Edinburgh show because they broke their leg and have been on morphine, playing Jongleurs without compromising your act, the joy of connecting with one (and only one) audience member and how it’s disappointing that TV just doesn’t take a punt on interesting comedians any more.

Yes it’s the award winning author and comedian Catie Wilkins, who Rich likes so much he married her. In this podcast recorded in Htichin before the Fringe began, the pair discuss mathematics based sexual kinks, how Rachel Riley would have reacted to Richard doing her make-up, the state of Richard’s feet (with video evidence for badgers) why Catie’s show is called “We’ll See” and what horrible lies she tells about Richard in it, why she hasn’t done a show telling her side of Richard’s cancer experience (yet), when the right time for her to murder Richard will be and how she might do it, Richard’s plan to make sure no one has sex with Catie once he’s gone, how they divide up the funny material that their kids come up with, stuff to upset the inhabitants of Middlesbro and Ireland (but there’s nothing that they can do because we’re allowed) and Catie’s charming unawareness of one of the major news stories of 2025.

What would happen in a body swap film involving a tall person and a short person? Does everyone secretly want to eat dog biscuits? Why has chemotherapy ruined root vegetables for Richard and is Ed Gamble the monster that Richard hopes him to be on tour?

They discuss the formation of this hub of comedy creativity and Richard’s part in it (not that he remembers), which Bill Murray it’s named after and what they will do if the other Bill Murray ever turns up. Barry chats about his Edinburgh Fringe show “My Seven Years as Lionel Richie” https://www.edfringe.com/tickets/whats-on/barry-ferns-my-seven-years-as-lionel-richie and the many other self-destructive comedic decisions he has made, how Edinburgh left him bankrupt and homeless, how he convinced tourists they could go inside Arthur’s Seat and how his commitment to the bit led to him losing paid employment.

Why did John sell all his records and albums and get on his bike to cycle round Europe? How did he cope with weird and rude hoteliers? How did his penis cause him to cross the continent under false pretences? Plus growing up in Birmingham in another era, his dad’s autobiography, giving Spike Milligan his address on a chip wrapper, how Ken Campbell did magic, realising why his school bully behaved in the way he did and why you should only take advice about creative jobs from someone who does it already. A couple of beautiful books from someone who might have people but who loves language and beauty. Do search out his stuff. You won’t regret it.

His guest is online sensation Rosie Holt. They discuss why Rosie moved from acting to comedy, how her videos went viral, whether it’s good or bad that people (both stupid and clever) fail to spot that they are a joke, why subtlety is required to mock today’s unsatirisable politicians, an unsettling experience with a dating app, what motivates men to send unsolicited dick pics and why is that not illegal? Plus are the posh unfairly maligned and how easy is it to play a trombone. Less flower arranging tips that I’d hoped for. Live RHLSTPs coming up.

They chat about how someone from Hertfordshire has ended up writing such an authentic book about America in the 20th Century, his writing process and why he spent a year just writing dialogue between the main characters, how you approach writing about dark subjects such as child abduction and murder in a respectful way, whether he was inspired by the X Files for one character in particular and Chris still works in Bishops Stortford library. Chris also talks very openly about his own troubled childhood and how this has informed the novel, but also led to him becoming a writer and how surreal journey of having bestselling novels, meeting Presidents and getting this book made into a huge TV series. A really inspiring podcast for any aspirant writers, though the take home is that success comes from hard work and being immersed in your idea. Don’t miss this one.

They discuss quite how huge an influence these shows were on Richard’s developing brain, what makes some shows memorable and others not, how some of these shows exist in our minds from before we have any other memories, the amazing creative teams behind successes like Thunderbirds, Bagpuss and Camberwick Green, when Norris Macwhirter was bested by a Simon Quinlank prototype, whether Johnny Ball had a bar of gold on his back, why Richard cried over a TV show when he moved to Cheddar and who N’kima was.

They chat about Paul’s incredible 59 year career, from working mens’ clubs and routines with Charlie Cairoli, through talent shows and learning the craft to the big break with Chuckle Vision.

Plus working with Tinchy Strider and moving into DJing. Paul talks movingly about losing his brother/partner and best friend and why he needed to carry on working.

George does most of the talking, which is probably for the best and reveals what he considers to the be the starting point of capitalism, why capitalism and commerce are not the same thing, the roots of Neo Liberalism in the closing stages of World War II, why it took 30 years to come to prominence, conspiracy theories versus conspiracy fictions, why the left has missed opportunities to defeat Neo-liberalism, what happened when Liz Truss tried to institute its policies all in one go, why Starmer is wrong to try and legitimise Reform and whether there is hope for the future and what we can do to stand up to a political system that threatens our planet.

They chat about growing up gay in a small town in the Welsh valleys in the late 80s and how that inspired this story, about how simplicity in writing can be incredibly complex, swirling around in cesspits of your own making, the tabloid reaction to homosexuality and how that is mirrored in today’s world, how a room above a shop becomes an escape and a place of freedom and how to stop the author intruding on the story. Excellent book, really interesting chat.

His guest is musician and actor (no, I am not doing it) Chesney Hawkes. They talk about growing up in a musical household, kissing Julia Sawalha, becoming a pop sensation at 19 and being bullied by adults who should have known better, the choice between leaning into his most famous hit or backing away from it, how love saved him from self-destruction, what Chesney’s autobiography might be called, whether his early success is a curse or a blessing, appearing in an advert with an orangutang, dancing nude in a stately home and Rich’s plans for Chesney’s grave.

They discuss what it is that a producer actually does (which is an awful lot as it turns out), how Lissa went from fan girl to producing the second and third series of this iconic series, the perfection of the casting and sometimes unrecognisability of the actors, the tragedy of Dermot Morgan’s death the day after the final day of filming, why you should never tell writers not to do something, the relative lack of photos and why it’s nice to look back at this series from the distance of three decades.

They talk about the new Tory leader (at time of recording) and how they compare with the sexiness of previous head honchos, how much we should tax billionaires and if we can change their mindset to make them less hoardy, spending millions to regain youth and why Nish should enjoy being 39 while he still can, the possible consequences of the US election (which you may know more about than us, but good to get some predictions in), ideal pre-gig food and what you shouldn’t eat, why Milton Jones (and now Nish Kumar) is the best comedian to support and what happens if his audience takes against you.

Plus how Royal protocol resulted in Cherie Blair getting pregnant, how Craig upset Donald Trump and the wrong uns that drifted through the Queen’s life.

Tony chats about his career and the factors that led to its implosion, how much coke he might have been taking a week, Kenneth Branagh's campness, the harshness of an industry that loves you when you're winning and the lessons he has learned.

They discuss whether the crimes of Christie are as familiar to younger people as they were to us in our childhoods, how you approach writing about such a gruesome and sensitive subject and the modern day events that inspired the book, how the 1950s were rather more grim in general than people seem to remember and how misogyny and racism pervade this story, trying to understand the kind of monster who would commit these crimes and why we want to read about them (and why journalists and authors want to write about them), the importance of making sure the victims of the crime are respectfully remembered, the enduring mystery of why Timothy Evans confessed to two of the murders and the chilling monster of the invisible everyman at the heart of these terrible crimes.

Rich and Marc talk about how little people know about this period and how most of the things they do know never happened, why having very few sources to work from doesn’t make this light and easy work, how Marc discovered the best way to cover this sprawling and tumultuous half a millennium was to tell it through the stories of various individuals and why unfortunately all these individuals had to be male, why the Venerable Bede is good if you have an ill cow, but not always so good if you want the facts of what happened, which Anglo Saxon king allegedly shat in the font at his baptism, which king had a threesome with his wife and her mum and which king came close to becoming a cropper in Cheddar Gorge. Plus the skill required to combine academia with readability and whether comedians and historians would have survived the departure of the Romans and the arrival of the Vikings (no they wouldn’t).

Although Chris says it’s not Top Trumps his cancer makes Richard’s look like a paper cut and the book is bold and matter of fact about the impact of a non-sugar coated stage 4 cancer diagnosis, but whilst acknowledging the spiral of grief that this inevitably caused, Chris discusses the catharsis of writing about it, applying sports psychology to the situation and seeing the positives of life rather than constantly worrying about death, which could come to any of us at any time. He talks about his own particular deeply unpleasant chemotherapy and the reasons he endured it and how he got through it, how comedy can help us through and how he hopes he might be around for a while yet. Plus how he coped with life after the Olympic victory and trying to avoid Alan Partridgisms.

      "description": "#538 Pocklington - Richard has just moved house and is mourning the items that didn’t make the grade. His guest is another comedy hero, Adrian Edmondson. They talk about bad Brummie accents, the shadow that is cast on his life from the 14 weeks he spent on the Young Ones, cutting Rik Mayall’s head open with a metal jug, the boarding school experience that he’s still recovering from to this day, how the tweenager Ade may have passed the toddler Rich on the streets of Pocklington, how lockdown and birds and vegetables finally gave Ade calm, performing in Star Wars without being allowed to see the script, the secrets of a successful showbiz marriage, getting to perform in the band you were a superfan of, getting kissed by Joni Mitchell and keeping David Bowie off the top of the charts.

This time they talk about his film and TV work in America, how getting the dream job of playing The Tick turned into a filming nightmare, general indifference to appearing in the greatest ever episode of Rick and Morty, screwing up your lines in front of of Keanu Reeves’ beautiful face and working with Michael Caine and wondering if you can talk about the impression you do of him. Plus why the Beatles song A Day in the Life needed to be much longer (listen here https://soundcloud.com/bren-murphy/a-full-day-in-the-life-by-peter-serafinowicz ), why some accents are difficult even for Peter (not for Richard though) and both men’s not fully positive experiences of Camp America.

The pair discuss Peter’s embracing of live work and technology, the return of Brian Butterfield and why Peter stayed in character for two hours after each show, using Deep Fakes on stage to bring the dead back to life, whether Abba turned up every night to do the curtain call for their hologram show, filming Sassy Trump with the guys from South Park and performing with Brian Eno in Venice.

She talks candidly about marrying the son of a Glasgow gangster, her many family tragedies and how she survived them plus how Jerry Sadowitz was almost killed at one of his first gigs, what she’d like to do with Roland Gift, witnessing horrific accidents and heart-warming scenes from daily life. Plus the Bay City Rollers, Vesta curries, working with your daughter, performing in a prison and that wonderful moment when you forget that you’ve stabbed someone. Some truly incredible stories from this brilliantly funny, mildly terrifying, but ultimately rather lovely woman.

      "description": "#534 Keenan Wayans - Richard is in Glasgow and by the time you hear this he should have an exciting announcement about a new acting role, as long as he doesn’t blow it by getting angry and slagging the show off. His guest is legendary broadcaster and comedian Fred MacAulay. They chat about why he left the world of accountancy behind to become a stand-up, resisting the temptations of post gig debauchery to go home and change nappies, skiing with Tara Palmer-Tompkinson, climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, how he felt when he was unceremoniously dumped from his long-running radio show, why he’s still gigging in his sixties, the only two words that Billy Connolly ever said to Fred and running naked through a field with Al Murray.

They chat about why women (and non-royalty generally) are so badly represented in history, how history is more fun if you’re allowed to be judgemental about the clearly horrible stuff, how even stories from as recently at the 60s show how pervasive certain ideas of women can be, how Eleanor chose her 18 people/groups to write about and how the book is more serious than one might have expected (but still has plenty of funny stuff in it too).

And no, sorry, he isn’t the bloke who designed the Chucky doll. See Rich's stand-up tour Can I Have My Ball Back - https://richardherring.com/ballback/ SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Are Black Holes black and holes? Can we time travel if we go inside one? Why is the one at the centre of the Milky Way smaller than most and what repercussions does that have for us? The pair talk about how Einstein didn’t think black holes would exist, the tragic and difficult lives of many of the people who proved him wrong, how the female scientists roles in all this have been often overlooked, how Marcus was the first person to talk to some of the key players in detail and how he is able to write for a board audience without compromising the science. Also are we holograms?

His guest is the multi-talented Rob Brydon. They chat about how a birthday message to Margot Robbie led to a part in a potentially Oscar winning film (You’ll know if it won by now, but we poor fools in the past did not), how Brydon pretended to be ill to get out of a guest slot on Would I Lie To You? and how the show has become bulletproof, how America managed to get two series our of the book Green Eggs and Ham, the impressive and old school range of work that Rob undertakes, touring with an 8 piece band and whether it’s ever good when a comedian does serious songs and the disaster and triumph of Rob’s first meeting with Sir Paul McCartney. Plus why family comes first and whether legacy is as important as your kids having you around!

His guest is comedy genius Armando Iannucci. They talk about how a Christmas advert was Armando’s proudest achievement, how it’s possible that 30 years have passed since the Day Today (apparently it’s something to do with the linear nature of time), when his novel is going to be published, the effect that ADHD had on his work, how America messed up The Thick of It, why Avenue 5 got cancelled, how he tortured Daredevil and whether Armando is ready to turn into a proper old man in his sixties. Plus Rich finally opens up about his cancer and worries where he stands in touring illness Top Trumps.

      "description": "RETRO RHLSTP #86 - Creative Differences - Richard has some news of an amazing time travelling finger and is clearly super excited to be meeting one of his all-time comedy heroes, Harry Shearer from off of This is Spinal Tap and The Simpsons. Rich was too scared to talk to him when he saw him improbably travelling on London's tube, but hopefully he won't just sit quietly, staring at him and saying nothing this time. The pair discuss Harry's career which seems to break the space-time continuum as he's worked with such legends as Abbott and Costello, Jack Benny and Mel Blanc. Why does Derek Smalls wrap his courgette in tin foil and what's his affiliation with Shrewsbury Town? How much creative control do the actors on the Simpsons have over the characters they have helped create? Is stubbornness a pro or a con when trying to make it in show business? What is the Jerry Lewis film, \"The Day The Clown Cried\" really like? Will we hear from Simpson's character Hugh Jass? It's an amazing interview with a driven and hilarious genius man. And Harry Shearer is in it too. Come and see the new show on tour - https://richardherring.com/ballback/tour SUPPORT THE SHOW!

They chat about what the word Heresy really means, the extraordinary gospels that didn’t make it into the New Testament which show Jesus’ murderous side and the magical powers of the Virgin Mary’s anatomy, the varying beliefs of early Christian sects, including one that said he hated kids and their parents, the many magical holy men who performed very similar miracles to Jesus and even provided dressing when they magicked up food, the Romans who couldn’t understand how you’d choose between them and how in spite of this the religion was adopted by the empire. Did Jesus have a twin? Did he persuade someone else to get on the cross for him and how close did Life of Brian get to the truth?

He's certainly met his match in pedantry and both men accidentally reveal some shocking details about their respective psyches. Never have two men discussed at such length the vagaries of choosing between a ham hand and a sun lotion arm pit. And that is GUARANTEED. The Peep Show stationery cupboard, romantic subterfuge and the Daily Mail readers' internet comments are all up for discussion and we'll find out how an early discussion about Eric Morecambe almost brought the pair to blows. Did Rich really meet some Shreks and a Justin Lee Collins in the street? And what was Tim from The Office like before he became Tim from The Office? Is Richard as bitter and mean as he seems and will he ever get a Googlewhack audience? What's it like to play Aerosmith at table tennis? Will Rich ever forgive his mum for her Brideshead Revisited Alfresco trump? Why don't the audience understand any of Richard's obscure 1980s references? What would you do if God granted you the power of having exactly the same hands as Hermione from Harry Potter? And just how many David Mitchells are there anyway? It's a marathon of a podcast, but there's no cheating and we both stay in it for the whole thing. It'd be nice if there was a happy ending. But there's a slightly unhappy ending.

They chat about the insight the notes, letters, scripts and thoughts give to the mind of this extraordinary thinker, the notebooks that started with optimism, moved into self-hatred and then largely remained blank (that most writers will be familiar with), the alternate reality where Adams gave up writing, what Arthur Dent was almost called, how unusually for a writer Adams became a celebrity himself and the unusual focus of the paparazzi at the film premiere.

Insecure, confident, fragile and strong - all the things that make a great comic.

This week it's a welcome return for one of the worst guests we've ever had on RHLSTP (and I am saying that because that's what he says about me on Pointless), it's the charmingly offensive giant, Richard Osman. Will Osman realise where he's gone wrong with his TV shows and finally commission Richard to write and sing the theme tune? Will Pointless ever take the money and head to Channel 4? What will Osman say about Rich's mum this time? Why can't chocolate manufacturer's put aside their differences? How big is a glass? Is it OK to propose to someone over Twitter? How many times can you lose on Pointless and still hold your head high? What do the Chinese think of Osman? Is it better to be single in your twenties or your forties? As you'd expect it's a wide-ranging chat and a delight from start to finish.

      "description": "Book Club #95 - The Wager - Richard takes a Transatlantic call luckily in a time when it’s much easier to traverse the oceans, with David Grann the best-selling author and journalist, about his fantastic book The Wager - A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder. It’s an unbelievable and remarkable true story which has much to tell us about our history and the present day. David talks about what it’s like to work on a book that goes on to be an Oscar Nominated move, Killers of the Flower Moon and how he discovered the largely forgotten story of The Wager, the meticulous research required to create a book like this and how to deal with conflicting accounts of the same story. Also the surprisingly horrendous effect of scurvy, the difficulty of persuading men to become sailors at a time when death seemed almost inevitable, the class divisions and racism that made the crew of The Wager’s nightmare voyage even more nightmarish, how a cut off ear was the impetus for all of this madness and David’s slightly insane trip to visit Wager Island and why it was worthwhile. A really excellent chat about a highly recommended book.

They discuss working with Christopher Guest, how Richard could have gone to drama school if only he’d been any good at acting, being rescued by a topless lady, how to pronounce taramasalata, whether political comedy is the be all and end all and what motivates comedians to do charity.

They discuss the comedy scene in Manchester in the early 90s, how writing a quatrain a day has led to this collection of amusing, thoughtful and brilliant poetry and acts as an inspiration to us all to write something every day, for ourselves. They also discuss Lemn’s heartbreaking, yet powerful autobiography “My Name Is Why” telling about his childhood, the betrayal of his foster family, life in care and how his life was affected in very different ways by the work of Lenny Henry and that of Jim Davidson. And ultimately how he has weathered his childhood trauma and processed it to become the incredible man he is today.

Starstruck and clearly in disbelieving awe, Rich flounders around and mainly embarrasses himself, but luckily Mr Cross is able to come up with some amazing riffed comedy about frozen vegetables, Abraham and taking cocaine near President Obama, whilst getting a bit more serious about Donald Trump, the responsibilities of fatherhood, why Richard should probably not take hard drugs, the benefits of the middle-aged sketch show and David’s part in the creation of kickstarter. Richard hoped that he would so impress David that they would become good friends and could appear in Doctor Doolittle 3 together as method-acted monkeys, but I think it’s safe to say that that will not happen. Cross put away an impressive amount of bitter during this podcast and still remains focused and coherent, but clearly needed the toilet near the end, which turns into a battle of the obstinately pedantic 1990s underrated sketch show stars.

They discuss the frustrations of writing for TV, a top tip to move towards writing a novel, how a memory of a forgotten sitcom script led to the creation of this series, making Manchester the star, using a comedian as inspiration for one of the characters, selling TV rights and retaining control over your work by setting up your own company and publishing house, as well as using more traditional avenues. A fantastic success story and lots of great advice for your own writing.

In the chat Joe reveals more than any guest has done before, literally and physically as he recounts many tales of clumsiness and accident, including how he nearly died the perfect comedy bath (again literally), the funniest telling of a having a badly broken leg after being run over, how a flight with the Red Arrows ended in excruciating pain and an upsetting encounter with some bum grapes. Plus how Ken Dodd helped the young Pasquale become a hit, the boredom of I’m a Celebrity, an amazing story about what happens if you piss off (or piss on) Christopher Dean, how a comic real life explosion led to Joe playing Frank Spencer, a legendary episode of Doctors and connecting with his son. It’s an amazing podcast from a terrifically funny man. Don’t miss it.

Cheddar Gorge (obviously) or rubbishy old Wookey Hole. It'd be a shame to have Britain's most exciting film director on the show without wasting most of the time talking about this and the obscure and sexist Roald Dahl short story - Switch Bitch. And Richard hates to disappoint. Luckily he occasionally manages to blunder into discussing Wright's canon of work, from A Fistful of Fingers through Asylum, some ideas for a new series of Spaced, right up to the amazing new film The World's End. But there's still time to talk about what it's like to be taught by both parents, desecrating the graves of your former employers and Rich's ideas to reboot Goodnight Sweetheart and We Will Rock You before Edgar has to dash off to finish off his new film.

Why aren’t the people of Winchester making more of this, like the king-stealing thieves of Leicester? What happened to King Alfred and why did he choose to build a palace at Richard’s school? Why were the women of the period written out of history? What happened to the bones of those killed in major battles? Why are the things we know about kings of this period nearly all made up? Why did the early kings have such complicated names and not just call themselves something like Cnut which is easy to remember and why didn’t they think of historians who would be doing audio books and come up with monikers that would be easier to pronounce.

The pair bring out the best worst in each other again, alternating between inappropriate chat about wangs and fufus and serious topics like the rise of anti-intellectualism, the imminent destruction of the planet and what motivates anyone to betray a living God. Also what would you do if you had the chance to destroy a space ship where a small majority of the aliens were evil? Should dirty britcom confessions be seen as a compliment? How does David Duchovny spend his spare time on set? Has anyone interviewing Tim not attempted the obvious Groundhog Day joke? And most importantly has Tim Minchin ever tried sushi?

He talks about how he coped with losing 95% of his sight at 18, why he was still determined to become an accountant and why he refused to accept that unaccompanied blind people weren’t allowed to travel the world. Richard inevitably attempts to claim that mind blindness is as serious a disability and receives terrible prejudice in return. Also climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, risking a piss in the middle of the night on top of a volcano, sky diving and wanting to fly solo round the world, needing to look more blind for the BBC and a surprising mentor for Amar’s writing.

      "description": "#488 Fifty Shades of Rae - Richard is in the City Varieties Leeds, the scene of a traumatic RHLSTP that he and the audience are still processing. And he’s booked another rock star, will they be as much trouble? It’s the sublime Corinne Bailey Rae. They talk about the whirlwind of her early success, why on earth she’s choose to still live in Leeds, how a teacher crushed her dreams of playing classical violin, her forays into Christian Rock, why she called her first band Helen, exposing emotion to write music that even touches Richard’s dead heart, being expected to carry on producing happy music in the face of tragedy and the genius of her latest eclectic album Black Rainbows. It’s another absolute classic episode. See RHLSTP on tour- http://richardherring.com/rhlstp See Rich's stand-up tour Can I Have My Ball Back - https://richardherring.com/ballback/ SUPPORT THE SHOW!

They discuss the latest of his many books about Rebus and Edinburgh (is it a character in itself?), how well Ian knows the character after all this time, why he chose to have him age in real time, how his books embrace topicality, whether Rebus could really pull Duckface, why Ian let go of the TV adaptations, the changes made by American publishers and how persistence from the author led the series to be a huge success (and how long that took to happen). Plus the looming presence of Richard Osman, being asked to write the autobiography of Sean Connery, Ian’s attempt to write a Mills and Boon romance and whether it’s possible to understand evil.

      "description": "#483 Nit Infestation - Richard is at the Stand in Newcastle with an enthusiastic Sunday afternoon crowd and he’s amazed by the number of ginger hues he can expect in the city. His guest is comedian Lauren Pattison. They talk about how low things had got for her during their last chat in lockdown, how the worst day to dump a comedian is April Fool’s Day, how working in Morrison’s during the pandemic was surprisingly creatively inspiring, coping with online criticism and how her last Edinburgh show was literally make or break for her and how, approaching thirty, she is overcoming anxiety and believing in herself.

      "description": "#482 May The Force Be With You - It’s a very special and moving Christmas episode as Richard talks to Ukranian comedian Vasyl Baidak about performing comedy in a war zone, how comedy has differed before, after and during the conflict, performing in shelters and trenches, how comedy helps process the horror and how absurd comedy seems redundant in the more absurd state of war, converting Stewart Lee tickets into a car, being championed by Stephen Fry, the influence of Andy Kaufman, building the country back one house at a time and keeping the Ukraine in people’s minds and raising funds for the military. How do you tour and celebrate Christmas in a war? It’s an incredible story from a very eloquent man speaking in a second language (where school lessons did not prepare him for talking about war). Please listen and share this one. And tonight don’t thank God it’s them instead of you. Ask God why anyone has to be in this situation.

They talk about how a last minute self-tape got him a recurring role in Ted Lasso, where Death in Paradise meets Milton, how his first double act led to him losing his virginity and then his bottle, the extraordinary sequence of events that led to his first TV show, whether finger-wagging admonishment might make the bad guys of history reconsider their actions, whether moving back to Devon was a good idea, the importance of how you look walking on to stage, the electric heat of creating comedy on stage and how he came up with the character of the Herbert and whether there has been any reaction to Upstart Crow from Ricky Gervais.

      "description": "RETRO RHLSTP #64 - Sarah Kendall - Richard is amazed how a joke on Twitter now pretty much always gets taken at face value by someone, even if it's in an open letter to an 8 month-old baby. His guest is Nicole Kidman impersonator and fantastically thoughtful yet and puerile stand-up Sarah Kendall, fresh from her nomination for the big comedy award at the Fringe. They discuss the horrors of child birth, the redundancy of the hand job, growing up in New Newcastle, how audiences can sometimes laugh in the wrong way, the plot holes in Back To The Future, loads of stuff about cocks and vaginas (obviously), the inevitability of nuclear destruction, plus some surprisingly serious bits about the nature of being a stand-up. To be honest, most of the time we forgot that we weren't sitting in the lounge in our Edinburgh flat having the kind of conversations with one another that are totally unacceptable in the actual world.

And it’s a meeting of Turner Prize winners past and future as his guest is a name that will echo through the ages (hello future humans) Grayson Perry. They discuss God-like soft toys, the similarities between comedy and art, motorcycle clothing, women’s clothing, masculinity, gender rigidity, who Grayson actually shared a squat with, making sandwiches in a hairdressers, Jerry and Rupert making love on top of a homeless person, how the rich provide an ark that can take art to the future, asking an artist what his favourite colour is, whether art’s job is to observe or attempt to affect change, biting the hand that feeds and adolescent numbness.

He always wears a suit. There’s nothing unusual going on. His guest is just some guy from some old sketch show and the first Knight (that says Ni) on the podcast, Sir Michael Palin. Obviously Rich is in awe and on his best behaviour, but that won’t stop him bringing up one of Michael’s rare career disappointments and nearly derailing everything. But Michael is everything you’d hope for and you can find out what he got paid for his script being used in Sliding Doors, how the Fish Dance went down in North Korea, how Life of Brian might have been Python at its height, the perils of being a mud eater, how Mrs Palin ended up on Saturday Night Live, why Terry Jones was the heart of Python and how this remarkable friendship between writing partners was maintained right to the end. Plus the best impression of Cicero that you’re likely to hear. Will Richard end up in the diary and what terrible things will be said about him…? We will have to wait. Monthly badgers - your backstage interview includes Michael ad-libbing a brand new scene for Life of Brian which I would say is worth your monthly subscription to the end of time. So sign up to see this - we don’t get many emergency questions on stage, but he did a few in the dressing room. http://gofasterstripe.com/badges SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Richard talks to acclaimed historian Ben Macintyre about his fabulous book about the true story of Colditz - beyond the Boy’s Own stuff we grew up and incorporating boredom, propaganda spreading wasps and homosexuality. It’s Richard’s favourite book of 2022 (now out in paperback) telling the story of some of the more famous inhabitants of the castle like Pat Reid and Douglas Bader (who was both a hero and a monster), as well as some of the lesser known and unknown figures like Alex Ross and Birendranath Mazumdar. The pair also chat about the incredible last days of Colditz and the hell of the slave labour camp in the town. Plus a brief chat about some of Ben’s other fantastic books and how they read like novels, whilst still being entirely factual.

It’s a transatlantic podcast this week as Richard chats to fantastic author and journalist Jon Ronson, in a typically unlikely location in New York. They are chatting about his new Audible audiobook/podcast Debutante, a deep dive into the extraordinary life of Carol Howe, the former debutante who became a Neo-Nazi and then an informant and then… well who can be sure? It’s a fascinating and often harrowing investigation into whether the Oklahoma bombing might have been prevented, who might have been involved and the often compelling conspiracy theories that have sprung up. Rich and Jon discuss how he copes with the dangers he puts himself in, the fight between rival strippers that provided a possible clue to whether Timothy Mcveigh was a lone wolf, the importance of keeping a sense of balance and not going down the rabbit hole, how Jon is the Simon Cowell of investigative journalism and whether, as middle aged men, Richard and Jon are in danger of getting obsessed with some mad theory and ruining their lives. It’s a lot of fun. Listen to Debutante on Audible https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/The-Debutante-Audiobook/B0BV18S28C . It’s up to you whether you do that with your free book for joining or not!

The show included an erudite and interesting alternate point of view from an Asian member of the audience, which sadly was not picked up by the microphones, but which we hopefully discussed fairly nonetheless.

They talk about offending Claudia Winkleman’s listeners, how Channel 4 messed up a sketch show with an incredible cast, (briefly) having the number one Netflix show (check out Lockwood and Co), whether being a director is all it’s cracked up to be, how losing a Fiat Punto led to Attack The Block, working with a Young One and whether ageing is something to fear. Plus the surprise of finding out that someone who has died was still alive and a bizarre synchronicity on the song with the best intro.

Richard talks to Evie King (if that is her real name) about her new book about her council job of organising funerals for people who don’t have the means to pay for them. It’s a surprisingly affecting story about a woman doing a job you’ve never thought about, much more fastidiously and empathetically than is required and a celebration of life and a treatise on death, as well as being full of intrigue, mystery and humour. They discuss why murderers haven’t thought it through, how even those who have done bad things deserve a dignified send off, why you need a strong stomach for this job and how your life can be affected and changed by someone who you never met, who is no longer alive. It’s a strong recommend for this excellent book which hopefully will one day be a TV series. But who will play Evie? And who will play the dead suspected paedo? (Yeah, the second question is easier to answer than the first). https://www.lovereading.co.uk/book/9781915306302/isbn/Ashes-To-Admin-Tales-from-the-Caseload-of-a-Council-Funeral-Officer-by-Evie-King.html SUPPORT THE SHOW!

      "description": "#427 Retribution - Richard is hoping to get a bridge named after him in Great Yarmouth and hopefully his fans will do better than they did in getting him nominated for a British Comedy Award. It’s an incredible guest to start the new series, making his first appearance in almost 10 years, Stephen Merchant. Stephen has some questions for Richard about his first stint on the podcast and Richard doesn’t really have any answers. But after a bit of squirming the pair get talking about meeting your heroes, your parents meeting your heroes, how an omelette was the clincher in getting Christopher Walken on to The Outlaws, the KLF style destruction of a Banksy, the Herring’s Eye, the surprising news that drugs can be quite good fun, how Stephen made an impression at a Sarah Silverman party and his move into serious acting. Are they friends again by the end? I guess we’ll find out in ten years time. Come and see us live http://richardherring.com/rhlstp SUPPORT THE SHOW!

There are a lot of talking points including the way the 60s began to define class and masculinity, how the Beatles symbolise love and Bond symbolises death, the sadness/trauma in the childhoods of most of the people involved, the bizarre way George Lazenby was tested to see if he was right for the part, the constant reinvention of Bond, how the idea of Fake Paul took root whilst the Beatles were about to die and Richard’s idea for John’s next book (which he doesn’t seem that interested in, so you can write it instead).

His guest is singer, podcaster, 24 hour dancer and lock down internet sensation Sophie Ellis-Bextor. They discuss Richard’s feelings for Sophie's mum, being carried to bed by Joey from Bread, why Sophie was embarrassed when Jarvis Cocker used her toilet, the weird and sometimes horrifying culture of the 1990s, how Sophie has combined being a pop superstar with family life, falling down Esther Rantzen’s staircase and making up with Robbie Williams and how Sophie has made a life long career in a fickle business. Plus how she ended up in Neighbours and Game of Thrones. And how to stop your husband playing golf. Sophie is a truly inspirational person and her book is open and honest.

And to celebrate this occasion there’s a record breaking fourth appearance from the grandson of a Batman, Adam Buxton. Adam sets the agenda from the start, bearing gifts, mocking stone-clearing like a philistine, revealing what 1995 Richard Herring had somehow discovered annoyed Stewart Lee and attempting a slightly underwhelming tribute to Groundhog Day. Plus find out how Nile Rodgers responded to jokes by kids, why a head in a jar has to bring its own cloth, whether it’s possible to have a film set at Stonehenge without the stones being knocked over at some point and whether child-men in their fifties have to finally grow up. Plus some extraordinary epistles from World War One and how fields with barbed wire can still cause injury even today. Thanks to everyone who has supported this endeavour over the last 200 episodes and six years. Hopefully we can continue to move onwards and upwards. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

How a successful TV appearance become an albatross round his neck, the freedom of coming to the Edinburgh Fringe and recreating national monuments out of cornflake packages, going to a funeral in character and having another success that came with negative effects, what it’s like to be immortalised on the Simpsons and whether being a rebellious, self-sabotaging comedian is possible any more.

They discuss schoolday soilings, dick-lifters, being related to a ghost, little Alex Horne, the exquisite pain of laughing when you’re not meant to, sex with teddies, the saddest of bachelor meals, the death of two fathers, the devastating surprise of ageing, what it takes to be in your fifties, the weirdest group of celebrities to gather at Buckingham Palace and the wondrous comedy of commitment to joyous stupidity. It’s eye-wateringly funny stuff with two childish old men who should know better. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

They talk about the terrible behaviour of the Sheriff of Nottingham, how to explain modern day notions of gender to the old and confused, the previously unexplored positive sides of being in a human centipede, how comedy can help us cope with tragedy and our darkest thoughts, how marriages manage to survive for 40 years, whether Sliding Doors is a great film or definitely isn’t and whether masculinity is defined by stopping a child being hit by a baseball bat.

Rich is prepared to go to great lengths for a part in Ghosts and there are some definitive answers to the ghost emergency questions, plus find out why the lovely film Bill has been overlooked, why it’s nice to get an acting job near your house and what it’s like to have played important roles in Peep Show.

They discuss the dynamics and disagreements that come with collaboration, the nostalgic sexual time waves of early 1980s fashion, the one occasion when Terry laughed, being mistaken for a ventriloquist by the taxman, why the greatest album of all time only made it to 95 in the charts and why Terry didn’t end up as a hairdresser. There’s some serious chat about sexual abuse and depression and how Terry had dealt with these traumas and some cruel assessments of the town of Coventry. And can the power of RHLSTP finally get the album Home to number 1 where it belongs? No, I don’t think so. It doesn’t seem to be commercially available. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Richard’s guest is the brilliant actor and writer and also his ex-girlfriend, Sally Phillips. They talk about the girl who smelled of spam and Sally’s impressive performance in the film “How To Please A Woman”, but they can’t avoid the elephant in the room and discuss there somewhat different memories of the break up of their relationship (and at least one of hers confuses a sketch with reality, but what is truth?) and how this impacted on their Edinburgh shows (and lives). Can they reach a place of forgiveness for their behaviour? Also Sally’s side of the Princess Diana love triangle, how being in a comedy gang in the 1990s gave us all too much confidence, how she got the job in Alan Partridge, what led to her working with Mr Tumble and speculation on why Hugh Grant doesn’t talk to her. Also the impact of disablist language (and an appearance from her son, Ol), grabbing the reins of power, being careful what you wish for, Dexter Fletcher and a tension that makes this one of the greatest and funniest RHLSTPs ever.

First though there is a real life mystery to try and solve. Then Fergus explains how the character of Fishback was born and how in turn Fishback’s character of Detective Roger LeCarre came to life and find out about whether Fergus was nervous about turning an internet hit into a full blown novel. We also get to hear a bit of the book read out by Fishback and hear about the excellent TV pilot for the character and how Rich destroyed the dreams of two young comedians with a harsh dose of realism. Plus they talk about how many Kit Kats are made every month and how it would be better to invent a chocolate bar than write books, the two or more schisms that have been created by scones and the skill required to read an audiobook. Rich rudely recommends a totally different book and Fergus also tells us about what he’s been reading.

His guest last appeared on the show almost exactly a decade ago, it’s the comedy genius Reece Shearsmith. They chat about his excellent new film “See How They Run” https://www.searchlightpictures.com/see-how-they-run/ and working with the starry cast, why he’s not really open to public suggestions for Inside Number Nine locations, the League of Gentleman’s journey from the Canal Cafe to the stage at the O2, owning a piece of the Wicker Man and meeting the man from inside the Wicker Man and how Bernie Clifton responded to “Bernie Clifton’s Dressing Room”. Plus some magic tricks that probably won’t work in the audio podcast, though you can watch the video if you join Acast Plus https://plus.acast.com/s/rhlstp or pay for the video http://gfsboxoffice.com An absolutely electric show in a packed Leicester Square Theatre - the audience makes this show, so do check out the upcoming bills and come along if you can http://richardherring.com/rhlstp SUPPORT THE SHOW!

It’s a fascinating chat that embraces DNA technology, the chance discovery of texts whilst looking for ping pong balls, the first description of the female orgasm and the surprising number of cocks on the Bayeaux Tapestry. Plus whether there can ever be any truth in history and how most of the major facts that people know about the past are all made up. It’s a Sunday Times best seller and has a picture of a vagina on the front and if that’s not enough to make you buy it, then I think this chat will convince you.

They chat about how a passionate speech at the Kennedy Centre led to Vir being in danger of arrest in his native India, how the world is split between those looking to the future and those wanting to stay in the past, the difference between patriotism and nationalism, how terrible events are great news for comedians, ghostly experiences, working with Judd Apatow and how Vir got the attention of Bollywood film producers. A really stonking episode with a world class comedian and film star (sadly both Vir). Don’t miss it.

Never mind - his guest(s) today are Conrad Koch and his little friend Chester Missing. They talk about what makes a normal human being turn to ventriloquism, how a puppet can be the best medium to discuss huge political issues (or they can be a carrot that fails to do double entendres properly), how Chester because a huge hit in South Africa and why politicians want to be interviewed by him, plus the revelation that the end of Apartheid was not the end of racism and why racism is white people’s problem. Richard decides to show Conrad how to do ventriloquism properly and so there’s an appearance from a certain cancerous bollock. Who is the best ventriloquist?

The podcast largely turns into the vehicle for a RHLSTP clips show as Joe quizzes Richard about his favourite and least favourite guests and what the future might hold for the valuable RHLSTP franchise.

It’s am hilarious and fascinating conversation, but goes into areas that some may find inappropriate or offensive, but there’s a clue in the name.

      "description": "#389 Kiss - Richard is mourning the loss of his best friend, but he has to carry on working through his grief. His guest is Strictly love rat, Seann Walsh. They discuss his incredible new stand up special and whether people overreacted to his admittedly selfish behaviour and why people are so keen to judge and don’t seem to care if they will be judged themselves. It’s a powerful conversation about the consequences of his self-defeating actions and a story that sounds like a Biblical morality tale, but which shows how it is possible to come back from the pits of despair. Seann talks about why he gave up drinking and the positives of his experience, why Michael McIntyre is the greatest of comedians and creating a short film on a train journey home from a bad gig and Rich explains his biggest social media storms have come from the times he’s tries to be nice. Let he who is without sin… I’m not saying I’m Jesus, that is for others to say. His stand up special is very much worth watching - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0yzhbFHPwo Buy tickets to his new Fringe show here - https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/seann-walsh-is-dead-happy-now SUPPORT THE SHOW!

His guest is a man who has done Chekov, Dickens and Celebrity Juice, Johnny Vegas. It's a truly fascinating discussion about the duality of the stand-up and where a Johnny ends and Michael Pennington begins. Michael discusses the lengths that Johnny would push him to and his total commitment to being a dog on stage, whether contentment and success mean the death of the character, how to make your own audience out of balloons, why he got the worst degree in his year at University and how he got his revenge. Plus how Monkey has clung to his back like a monkey, and the funniest sex show in history. It's really good. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

It's a writer's masterclass, showing the determination and talent that is needed to make it in the business (with Rich as the perfect example of how not to make it), with great stories about the genesis of Band of Gold, the importance of empathy for your characters, using real life stories and when to keep secrets and how a working class mum made it in a business so skewed towards men and what can be done to level the playing field. Plus Rich possibly lands his first ever job as a result of doing the podcast - though it's a part very much within his comfort zone. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

His guest is the extraordinary Deborah Frances-White. They talk about whether Dracula was ever young, but the podcast is mainly about the major decisions Deborah had made in her personal life and the way she has chosen to deal with the traumas of her past. She talks about what having an open marriage means for her and how she has reset her brain with the help of a Peruvian shaman. This might not be the way forward for everyone, but she talks openly and honestly about her spiritual experiences. Plus there’s an impromptu charity auction. Sex and drugs and RHLSTP mugs.

They chat about Paul’s incredible 59 year career, from working mens’ clubs and routines with Charlie Cairoli, through talent shows and learning the craft to the big break with Chuckle Vision.

Plus working with Tinchy Strider and moving into DJing. Paul talks movingly about losing his brother/partner and best friend and why he needed to carry on working.

It's just what he does. But even if an audience member dies then the show must go on (especially if it was a slightly annoying audience member). This week's guest is the former Westlife obsessive, Sofie Hagen. Luckily we're in a post-Brexit world now, allowing Rich freedom to let everyone know his true thoughts about Denmark and the disappointment that is the talked-up Copenhagen. They discuss what constitutes creepiness from a stranger, what's going on with the Danish alphabet, what happens when a fan is more famous than the person they stalked and Rich gives Sofie some important lessons in badger-identification and the British Royal Family, and kites lead us to some unexpected places.

His guest is actor, director and musician Laura Jean Marsh. They chat about leaving home at 16 to be in a band, how Laura Jean’s experiences in the music scene inspired her to write, direct and star in the feature film, Giddy Stratospheres, how she persuaded Richard to take a part in the movie, how the Hell you get something like this off the ground during lockdown and how taking a punt can lead to all kinds of opportunities. Plus is it too soon to be nostalgic about 2007 and a horrifying emergency question about back lips and some stuff about Scooby Doo. An inspiring chat for anyone who hopes to get a creative project off the ground. You can watch Giddy Stratospheres for free on Amazon Prime (if you are an Amazon Prime member) or rent from all the usual places.

His guest is the king of the clowns and circuit legend, Chris Lynam, who you might know from his firework up the bum routine, but who has a whole lot more to him than that. They chat about what Chris remembers of the early alternative comedy scene, working with Ken Campbell on The Warp, Malcolm Hardee overestimating how easy it is to light fireworks in your buttocks, the Greatest Show on Legs, ErictheFred (check out some clips from this beautiful show here https://chrislynam.net/eric-the-fred/ ), what destroyed the spirit of alternative comedy (and Richard’s part in that), who destroyed the rainforest of Zimbabwe and how Chris nearly became impaled on a bed of nails. Plus the times that his perilous appearing act actually spilled over into real danger, the heart and soul of the clown and how Chris has managed to maintain the same level of madness without actually turning any more mad. This is a cracker of a show and if you haven’t heard of Chris you should definitely still listen. And do catch him live if you get the chance. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

They discuss Arnold Schwarzenegger’s farting revenge, King Edward VII’s weighing chair, the sexism of the boys in the Cambridge Footlights, how Miriam’s father’s life was spared by a diamond, an unusual approach to dealing with a sex pest, some strong opinions about the current government, making a soft porn tape, appearing in a Beckett play despite not liking it, starring in an American sitcom and why a lesbian ended up giving so many blow jobs.

And it's a surreal, dream-like and occasionally mildly awkward chat about working with Ken Campbell; Richard's failure to see one of Diane's first performances; Bruce Willis on The One Show; Richard's ever-spiralling shoplifting problem; the slight let down of earliest memories (and what is the latest earliest memory that anyone has ever had?); and the importance of making it clear that you're not dating Joe Wilkinson. Find out who Diane would kill if she had one bullet and no repercussions, and what she thinks might be in a medieval pie. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

But all the big historical questions are asked - why is Pan having sex with a goat? What did the people of Herculaneum use to wipe their bums? Where did Ancient Romans sleep? What were Julius Caesar's real last words? Is having sex with a statue the worst thing you can do? Mary also talks about Anus Arsehole Gill and how she fought back against the trolls, what words you can't say on Women's Hour and meeting the Queen with Bruce Forsyth. Back to normal then!

      "description": "#28 Death is Nice - Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith. With the world in shock about the accusations about an ex-BBC employee with long hair and an odd home life who raised money for charity, Richard is keeping his head down, but he is joined by the slightly odd men behind such hits as The League of Gentlemen and Psychoville, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton. They chat about the unlikely character of Davey from Henry IV part II, what it's like to work with Woody Allen, as well as a RHLSTP exclusive - the name of the duo's next TV project. Find out where the inspiration for Papa Lazarou and the Psychoville Tina Turner tribute act came from, and the ghostly real-life occurrences that Reece has experienced. If you've ever wondered whether this pair would prefer a ham hand or a sun cream armpit then wonder no more. Have they seen a Big Foot? You'll have to listen to find out. Although if you don't have time to listen then the answer is no. This was a lot of fun to be a part of. I think you will like it. Prove me wrong if you dare. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Inevitably there is a lot of discussion about obscure 1970s TV and Tim from The Office being in Sherlock and you'll find out which Doctor Who monster Mark would most like to have sex with. But other questions include: How did Mark prepare for the role that made him famous, the voice of Greg Evigan on TMWRNJ ? What characters DIDN'T make it into The League of Gentlemen ? What is the biggest fossil that he has ever discovered? Should Rich buy a metal detector? And there's a terrifying real-life ghost story, and more on conspiracy theories. It's gentle and largely dignified, as one would expect from two middle-aged men with colds and bad backs. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

They discuss their similarly comedy-nerdy teenage years, the early days of the alternative comedy circuit where Alexei Sayle’s stream of swearing might be followed by flying fish or slowly melting ice.

His guest this week also expects crockery in coffee shops, it’s David Mitchell. They discuss the cruel and ever speeding passage of time, how to revolutionise body swap comedies, obituary photos, how David turned out to be right about Upstart Crow and how Covid disrupted his first West End run, why David won’t be appearing on Taskmaster and how Richard was spared embarrassment when having his balls scanned. It’s got everything. Plus Richard tries out his new book “Would You Rather?” on the master of Emergency Questions.

But the good news is that Colin is back to remind his guests of times that things have gone wrong for them. Rich's first guest personally knows many of the people that Rich not-so-secretly lusts over at CBeebies - it's Iain Stirling. They chat about working alongside puppets (in their own different ways), how Love Island has turned Iain into a huge Edinburgh smash, the tragedy behind the Amazing Bubble Man and whether somehow Richard might be Iain's dad. Then Richard is joined by the Radio Times Comedy champion and also champion poor time keeper, Jason Manford to chat about the old bamboo, setting up comedy clubs, bizarre coincidences and I think a misunderstanding about what a human centipede involves.

There's lots of chat about the Edinburgh Fringe of the eighties, the point where comedy and tragedy meet, what happens when you become the carer for your comedy partner, what happens if you never wash your clothes, the Doug who became a diplomat, how Jerry Sadowitz terrorised the public, and curing rectal cancer. Sorry the first minute or so got lost, but I have attempted to recreate it (and it was nothing of any worth).

It's a battle to see who will say the most inappropriate thing, but for once Richard is given a run for his money as the pair discuss the facts about Tourettes, the positive effects in terms of creativity, the gatekeeper of the brain and what it's like to be able to inadvertently create brilliant emergency questions. Plus discussion of the new Leicester Square Theatre Stair Robot (which is a real thing, though in this conversation it is sometimes tricky to tell fact from fiction), why not-yet-disabled people are so idiotic and self-defeating when it comes to access and equal rights in general and who it is who needs to a magic drug to cure them. It's a fascinating and hilarious chat with some of the best emergency question answers you are ever going to hear.

In what is one of Rich's favourite ever RHLSTPs the chat encompasses whether a vegan can eat a ham hand, how a six foot tall penis man would cope with his terrible life, what it's like to be part of a younger generation of comedians who are about to storm the comedy citadel and claim their rightful crown, and why there should be more women on Would I Lie To You?.

The pair discuss big foot-based anal sex, the disappointing lack of shenanigans in the bar at the 1997 reboot of Blockbusters, setting up Jack Bauer's Facebook page, penis-length anxiety, how Stephen accidentally ended up shooting a porn film, the Wookey Hole paper-mill, what it's like picking up Ricky Gervais' Bafta and the rigours of filming with Halle Berry. Tim from The Office might get a mention. Due to Richard getting a bit overtired and over excitable it goes a bit weird towards the end, but Stephen has achieved a lot of success through the comedy of embarrassment, so it's nice for him to witness some at such close quarters. You are going to enjoy Richard trying to dig himself out the hole he creates and doesn't seem to want to escape. It's an awkward end to a fun series of which Richard is both proud and ashamed.

Find out if David swears during sex, if he would allow himself to be raped by a ghost, why he’s so obsessed with war that he’s apparently wearing a poppy in January and if he enjoyed working the cloakroom for TFI Friday. There are also some more serious chats about the mindset of someone who paps a couple going for a walk with their baby and why there is so much antipathy towards Ben Elton. But it’s possibly the funniest episode yet, with Mitchell, once again, giving possibly the definitive answers to some of the emergency questions. What a treat. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

So it’s a double remote podcast and the guest this week is a true comedy hero, the brilliant Nigel Planer. They try to remember what the project they almost worked together in the early 90s was (though have very different memories) and talk about the times Richard spent in Nigel’s house, without Nigel knowing. Plus some great stories about the early days of 80s stand up, coming up with characters in Peter Richardson’s van, the casting of Mike in the Young Ones and why it might well have turned out for the best, being attacked by security guards on the way to a Greek restaurant after being crushed by a huge prop, the genius of Nicholas Craig, how Do They Know It’s Christmas could have been even better, being big in Catalonia and the joy of a rejected script being accepted.

Richard’s guest is a man who has played all theatrical parts, but most notably the part of Brian Blessed. I couldn’t even begin to describe what happened on this extraordinary night, except to say it is was a bona fide happening. Try and predict how many words Richard will say in this. It’s a free form and extraordinary, yet sometimes beautiful and inspiring, journey through the career, philosophy and madness of a man who might be the greatest living Englishmen. How much of it is true? I can’t tell you. But at least some of it. Includes sticking it to Picasso, toileting on a mountain, biting umbilical cords, working with the young Peter O’Toole and Patrick Stewart, never dying and probably some other stuff. I can’t tell you. I had a little nap through most of it. Worth watching the video version to see my torture on what was one of the best experiences of my life. This podcast is absolutely unbeatable.

But also the songs, panto offers and sketch appearances that have followed. As well as her own podcast where she asks her guests weird and wonderful questions (Where does she get her crazy ideas?).

Don't worry, the nerds are still there and they're still the best! This week's guest is very tall and has never been told that before, it's sexually-charged comedian and actor Greg Davies . They converse about how W G Grace upstaged Greg's sister's wedding, how Guy Fawkes died and whether he'd welcome a time-travelling penis, how Greg embarrassed himself in front of Rik Mayall in a supermarket and bum-based encounters with doctors. It's raucous and very funny. This one might be worth watching on video. Not only does Greg have some amazing facial reactions, but Richard carries out one of the dirtybritcom confession fantasies on him. It's very, very sexy. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

In a frankly extraordinary, must-listen, funny, poetic and heart-breaking podcast Richard interviews quintessential Englishman (take that EDL) Stephen Fry. Find out what the Spice Girls said to Prince Charles about Prince Albert, the favourite expletive of Lionel Jeffries, why Fabian is the best character in Twelfth Night, why Richard is going to graffiti Fry's grave, which women Steve wants to have sex with, Richard's clunky attempts to audition for QI (will be more of that next week). Richard's clunky attempts to refer to Mr Fry as Steve, whether you have to read The Hobbit to be in The Hobbit, the commercial possibilities of an Ann Widdecombe sex tape, what happened when the Bishop of Bath and Wells went to a prison for young offenders and the insecurity of John Travolta. Some brilliant additional questions by Ben Evans age 12. And properly poignant revelations about mental illness. It is mind-blowing and moving. If you end up killing David Cameron after this podcast then that is not our responsibility. Next week classicist Mary Beard plus QI, Not the Nine O'Clock News, Blackadder etc producer John Lloyd.

They discuss Blankety Blank being the pinnacle of the showbiz ladder, how an enforced change of name might have changed everything, the hidden dangers of Treasure Hunt and who might have been the sky runner had they not been so athletic, the down side of fame and how Anneka bribed the paparazzi, what it was like to have your birth canal depicted on Spitting Image, attempting to track down her Madame Tussauds head, why she pretended to be her own agent and how Clemmie took on a life of her own, turning down the chance to be a Bond girl, taking revenge on the school bully and the power of chucking yourself into stuff and hoping for the best. All this and a possible pedo ghost. Come and see RHLSTP live (or watch online) at the Clapham Grand. Get your tickets here - https://claphamgrand.com/rhlstp/ SUPPORT THE SHOW!

This is going to be the case for the best part of the next year or two, so buckle in (and while you’re buckled, check your bits). His guest is the actor, podcaster, author, blogger, erstwhile stand up and opera singer, Andi Osho. Not only has she had immense quiz show success for Rich to be jealous of, she’s also been in his favourite show, Death in Paradise. Apparently she’s in Line of Duty too, but come on, Death in Paradise. Also find out why she became a stand up and why she stopped, what motivated her to go to America and why she came back and how she’s managed to base all three central characters in her new novel “Asking for a Friend” on herself. Rich and Andi also compare notes on what they learned when dating for comedy shows and talk about the creative process (as discussed in her podcast Creative Sauce). Plus ghosts and museums and a gallant use of a time travelling finger.

But what super powers has it given him? He starts a little weary, but the power of podcasts soon rallies him, thanks to his open and hilarious guest, 1990s Gamesmaster legend Dominik Diamond. They discuss the talented group of comedians that emerged from Bristol University in the 1990s, being conned into buying a llama farm in Canada with no llamas in it, how auditioning for the Word led to the Gamesmaster gig, Lee and Herring’s legendary appearance on the show and what really happened to Richard’s Golden Joystick and how much it might have been worth if he’d kept it, fighting with Mark Lamaar across two continents, marrying Whigfield, how too much cocaine damaged Diamond’s career and how too little cocaine damaged Herring’s, living next door to a Play Away presenter, plus some jolly limericks about cancer.

Bet you wish he was still doing the Aphantasia stuff right? His guest might have been Harry Potter, but he’s done OK anyway, it’s John Oliver. They discuss whether the Love Guru is worth the £3.49 rental fee, facing off to the SAS in a terrible gig in Aldershot, graffiting fruit on a terrible topical news show on More 4, the research required to play a Smurf, working with Dan Harmon, getting emails about medieval poetry from Terry Jones and whether the UK will ever manage to do a great topical comedy show and the one necessity that is required for that to work. Has success changed Oliver? How did he end up with a sewage plant named after him? And is a bad stand up gig equivalent to being in a war zone? Plus experiencing a 100% walk out, what it meant to be able to carry on doing Last Week Tonight (and RHLSTP) during lockdown and the return of an old favourite emergency question.

They chat about how a desire to stay in bed helped push Brian down the road to comedy, how he earned his stripes in the post headliner spot in a 1980s comedy club, how observational comedy can be like mining in a pit where the seams are empty, where comedy comes or seems to come from, playing the audience like an instrument, how Jerry Seinfeld helped Brian’s career, how annoying it must be to be Michael Collins, what to do if you’re being executed at 7am and what it’s like living in Las Vegas. Plus whether comedy keeps you young and how you stop getting bitter and faded in middle age. Brian’s stand up and sketch show are on Netflix and the brilliant sitcom Loudermilk is on Amazon Prime and is well worth your time. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

They chat about playing ping pong with Garry Shandling, Miss Piggy’s Wardrobe Malfunction, giving Homer Simpson 22 hours to live, writing jokes for the President (not that one) and the scripts that got away and how Rich helped a writers’ room to become majority women.

His guest is the reigning Taskmaster champion Ed Gamble. They discuss who is doing the most podcasts, the problem with banofee pie, naughty puppets, why heavy metal is childish, whether Ed’s fiancé is a paid actor, the Proustian memories brought up by gladiators and performing whilst looking at yourself in a sheet of perspex. Plus would being caught in an act of self-love on camera be good or bad for Richard’s career.

      "description": "#300 Socially Distanced - It’s a momentous occasion, not only the 300th numbered RHLSTP, but the first one since March in front of an audience. We’re at the prestigious Bill Murray pub in North London. Richard sits stage right for the first time (except when he interviewed himself for a kickstarter extra) and is being interrogated by John Robins behind a perspex screen. But is it to save the audience from corona or the people on stage from the unguents that will doubtless be flung by the Die Hard fans in attendance (why have they come to this? Surely they should be watching a DVD of Bruce Willis). They chat about The Problem With Men, whether there are regrets about old material, the philosophy behind stone clearing, the Stewart Lee issue, skirting the line betwixt political correctness and comedy and playing with madness as we plummet towards old age and death. It’s the real Richard Herring, not the crazy character (mainly) and includes new Emergency Questions sent in by listeners: Time travel, desert island Johns and Robins, penises, Japanese porn and much more. You can get an extra 30 minutes of chat by downloading the full show for just £8.

As It Occurs To Me: Series 3, Episode 6: It's the end my friends. It really is. Really, really. But don't cry, just say goodbye, it could be worse. Rich has stories of CJ from Eggheads and Al Qaeda and is unjustly critical of a charity trying to de-worm orphans in Haiti, Emma has the best poo stories to make you sick, Dan is dressed as Adam Ant and Christian is looking forward to next week's show. Will Pippa Middleton's Disembodied Anus survive? Will King Herod make an appearance? Will Andrew Collins say 'aside' or make an appearance in real life? Will Rich have to take the cumpkin-based punishment prescribed by last week's Moral Maze or does he have some kind of revenge planned for the dark and mysterious forces that make the ethical decisions? I don't know, why don't you just listen to the podcast? All I can tell you is that tears or some kind of bodily fluid will be spilled before the show is over. As much as we travel in time, can we truly change our fates? It's properly the end folks. Thanks so much for your support or your 1 star iTunes reviews. It's been fun.

But never mind, Richard is delighted to chat to journalist and pro poker player Maria Konnikova. They discuss her rise from someone who didn’t know how many cards were in a pack to a poker champion in the space of months, whether luck or skill rules our world, how our hands don’t bluff, how poker can help us in the real world and what it’s like to meet a world champion self-playing snookerist. Quite a lot of poker content, but it’s more about knowing ourselves and coping with the random shit that life and cards throw up.

      "description": "Retro AIOTM #26 - Back to June 2011 for another Retro AIOTM to try and distract you from the inevitability of lockdown 2. As it spirals towards the mountain that will put it out of its misery, Rich gets to think about this position in the comedy firmament after attending a Jerry Seinfeld gig (one of his last ever nights out with Andrew Collings). We’re trying to raise some money for live comedy venues with our latest kickstarter. Take a look at rhlstp.co.uk/kickstarter and back us if you like the look of it. As It Occurs To Me: Series 3, Episode 4: Rich and his forearm are regretting allowing the audience to make decisions about what is moral and what is not. He has been working hard on his punishment and is just hoping there is a 14-17 year-old boy who will be prepared to take the fruits (or seeds) of his labour. Dan, Christian and Emma are all lending a hand and together they have created one of the most horrendous comedy props in the whole of history. This show might actually break some laws. And if it doesn't then one of the weirdos in the audience definitely has. Rich had been trying to impress his girlfriend's parents and is coping with the stress of getting into the exclusive after show area at the Jerry Seinfeld gig on Friday. Emma has taken out a superinjunction on herself, Dan has been licking things in public and Christian has been recognised in a toilet in Ipswich. Perhaps foolishly there is another Moral Maze with even more dire consequences for Rich, Pippa Middleton's Disembodied Anus, and the return of an old favourite up to his old duplicity. Christian is up in arms about Britain's Got Talent, but not the stuff that's bothering anyone else. Plus there's the first real screw up of the 26 episodes we've done so far and we don't edit so we've just got to deal with it. Seriously, it is the 21st Century.

      "description": "Retro AIOTM #25 - It’s May 30th 2011 and AIOTM’s silver jubilee 25th ep. To think that Canadian baby of unknown gender is now 9 and the world has caught up a bit with its parents gender concerns. It’s a long, long ep. Hope you enjoy it. If you do, why not become a monthly badger at http://twitch.tv/rkherring or preorder Richard’s new book, The Problem With Men from wherever you preorder your books. As It Occurs To Me: Series 3, Episode 3: It's the 25th episode of AIOTM (aiotm) and the silver jubilee is marked with a new 'umpkin'. If you think it's cumpkins or dumpkins then you have to get with it grandad! And Rich has more than half an eye on the listeners of the future. He has also become disturbed by the Canadian couple who won't reveal the sex of their baby (is it as disturbing as Baby Massage? The babies seem to think so) and has been recognised in Amsterdam airport (but who has he been recognised as?).Emma is gate-crashing literary festivals and Dan has been enjoying some odd time with his family, whilst Christian may be close to being friends with the actual factual Lembit Opik. The audience for once come good and provide some spectacular tales of stuff that has occurred to them. This week's Moral Maze has to be heard to be believed and has consequences that could only have been predicted by the strangest person on earth, but demonstrates why the public should not be allowed to make decisions about anything of any importance. One of the characters has written a diary and Richard is halfway through the series without having had a nervous breakdown, but it can't be far off. Some of the accents in this show will make Cheryl Cole seem like the voice of 1950s BBC. And if Dan Tetsell gives you a cucumber, don't eat it. It's the longest AIOTM (aiotm) yet and maybe the funniest and you will learn things about penis enlargement that you might not want to know. But it'd be even funnier if you'd come and seen it live. People came from America, Mumbai and Salisbury to see this show. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

      "description": "Retro AIOTM #22 - Do you ever wish you could go back to the start of the 2010s and give it all another go? Well join me if you dare in another retro AIOTM and do exactly that. It’s 2nd November 2010 and I am talking about Celebrity Mastermind for the first of many occasions. If only I could go back and say junk food instead of fast food. That’s the only thing I’d change about the 2010s. Pre order my book here (please). Join me on Twitch why not? As It Occurs To Me: 2010 Special episode 3: We've made it to episode 22, but will we get any further. And are the dark secrets of the twisting and turning Lost-style over-arching plot about to be revealed? Or will we just make far too much of the first birthday of the cumpkin? And did Rich take the lunch marmalade millions? Emma has tales of the 1970s and groping, whilst Dan reveals the singular of paparazzi and Christian has been the victim of crime. Richard's writing process is the subject of a soul searching documentary and he also looks forward with fear to his forthcoming appearance on Celebrity Mastermind, whilst looking back at his romantic trip to Prague, with deluxe clocks and cloacas all on view. Ultimately Richard may be about to discover the very meaning of (or lack of) his existence? Is this the end? For AIOTM and for Stephen Fry's Twitter account? If only we could turn forward time.

But you can and then write your own retrospective introduction Catch Rich on his Twitch channel most nights. Help fund future projects by becoming a badger And preorder his new book “The Problem With Men” here . As It Occurs To Me: 2010 Special episode 1: It's episode 20 and As It Occurs To Me is back for a short autumn run. Richard fears the consequences of being the 21st Century Dustin Gee, but not as much as Stewart Lee should. God is also keeping an eye on the chubby comedian's material and if His representatives on Earth are anything to go by then He doesn't like it. In the meanwhilst, Emma has met an iconic TV star, Christian is a rock god and Dan looks like someone's dad, though Ben Elton is not looking like an ah-argh stand-up comedian. Strangers are wanting to marry off Rich and his non-imaginary girlfriend and she may be up for it, even if Rich has been watching porn films 'for research'. Plus there's been some unseasonable behaviour for early October and a big surprise about one of the country's favourite sceptics. All in all it's good to be back. Hope you agree! Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "Retro AIOTM #19 - Back 10 years to the Edinburgh Fringe 2010 - who would have dreamed that a decade later the whole thing would have been postponed? But you can pretend it’s all still happening by listening to this hour of culturally insensitive bilge written under extreme circumstances even for this half-arsed show. Remember you can see the 10 year older Richard Herring who doesn’t even have the politeness to write a script now, strutting his stuff on Twitch most nights, including the all new Ally and Herring’s Twitch of Fun on Thursday nights. And you can preorder Richard's new book “The Problem With Men” here or at any major book retailer As It Occurs To Me: Edinburgh Special 2010: What a ludicrous idea. In a Fringe where Herring is already performing 36 shows in 26 days, what would possess him to write an hour of stand-up and sketches about what he has been up to? Utter lunacy. Christian didn't got to bed til 6am by which time Richard was up and furiously typing at his keyboard to bring you stories of ghosts in the swimming pool, the Pride of Scotland and how he is more Scotch than a significant proportion of Edinburgh residents. Emma is fascinated with caterpillars and not in a cute way and Dan has been watching some experimental theatre involving birdlife and faeces. Whilst the spectre of Richard Herring might hang over Andrew Collings' solo show, there is an elephant in this packed and chandeliered room which is at least reminiscent of Collings. With Haribo coming out of their eyeballs how will the sleep deprived cast cope with this early start? And who is the most Scotch character on their roster of freaks? You might be surprised by the answer. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

You know the ways you can support us by now As It Occurs To Me: Series 2, Episode 8: The final show of the second series and all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. But 6Music is saved and the Bloomsbury is packed to the gills so it's a party atmosphere. Van Morrison has been supporting Christian, Emma is well up the duff, and Dan has been celebrating the fact he can now go to the zoo and not look like a paedo. Rich has almost met Rory from Doctor Who and Lembit Opik on the same day, and is taking a pop at God for winging it when he came up with the 10 commandments, which seems a bit hypocritical given the way Rich puts this show together. Infants will be born, but will they be slaughtered? And disenchanted characters will return to wreak their revenge, but which ones will turn up? No one could ever guess they will guess, it's obvious. Is it shit or is it good? It doesn't matter. All that counts is that it is over. For now. And it's time for a party around Richard's belly button. Thanks for listening.

If you’re enjoying these crazy steps back in time then you can become a monthly badger here or link you Amazon Prime and Twitch Prime accounts and give us money at no cost to yourself - watch this video to find out how As It Occurs To Me: Series 2, Episode 7: It's the penultimate episode of Season 2 and the whole country is reeling from the worst spectacle they have witnessed in years, the motorcycle clothing shop sketch. Is there any way back for us now? And is the way back to just keep doing the same sketch until people realise it is a new zenith of comedy? We've moved to the Bloomsbury Theatre because we think we're Virginia Woolf. Emma's been unable to use her new iPhone 4, Dan, who is half German has been praying for England to lose at football (so blame him) and Christian has been signing boobs because he is rock and also roll. We pull out the stops to annoy Bob Rudge and take a leaf out of the book of the lazy writers of My Two Dads. Blah blah blah Tiny Andrew Blah and we meet the odd daughter and dad from the Vodaphone adverts and eat the crumbs from out of God's kitchen bin, and what's going on with the high-backed armchair? It's repetitious and relies on stupid comedy voices and Rich has become everything he hates. But come in and join us, the cumpkins are lovely. And there's some stuff about football too.

      "description": "Retro AIOTM #16 - It’s here. These weeks of listening to ten year old comedy is finally worth it. MOTORCYCLE CLOTHING SHOP SKETCH is here - and I am advising people to pull down statues. I am a visionary. This was recorded back in June 2010 remember. I am Nostradamus (or is that Emma Kennedy). Why not become a monthly badger to celebrate me? As It Occurs To Me: Series 2, Episode 6: It's the 16th episode of AIOTM (AIOTM), 16 lost weekends of trying to satirise all comedy by producing a comedy show with no comedy in it. According to AM1975. As usual at this stage of the series, Richard is worried he is going mad and drunkenly wonders if he can convince some people who work in a motorcycle clothing shop that he has a motorcycle, to the amusement of only himself. Emma's dad is hanging out in bookshops enjoying his literary fame. Dan is wondering if he can get a laugh out of the King Herod bit that was written five minutes before the recording started, and Christian - whose guitar breaks just in time for his song - has a fine suggestion on how to solve the financial crisis. We're also trying to pull down the statues in Trafalgar Square, wondering how Richard has maintained a 20 year career in comedy when he knows no jokes, suggesting a new commentator for the World Cup, and considering if we should all have taken some cocaines to get some much needed publicity for the show. The real questions are: did Rich think the motorcycle thing was funny, or did he write it on purpose so the end would work? And does he have a high-backed armchair? Cos if he does, what other rumours will be true? Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

Richard is angry with Dettol and their plans to destroy the world and ITV HD for making him miss the one moment where England looked like they might win the World Cup. But everyone deserves a second chance whether it's fumbling goal keepers or shit broadcasters. Emma is in trouble on Twitter as usual and Dan has joined the iPhone revolution at the most ridiculous time possible. Tam Dalyell is on hand to congratulate the English and Kriss Akabussi gets a booty call. The audience are the filthiest and most depraved thus far, but into the 'As It Occurs To Me concept'. And I wouldn't like to be Matthew the Gospel writer once this has gone out. It's revenge time for him making King Herod look like a dick. And who has Richard been mistaken for?

But will Rich escape from Northampton and his responsibilities with his new child? Well if he does then he will be discussing the temporary immortality of Betty White, gun laws and how to deal with cold callers. Dan has been eavesdropping on strangers and Emma has been trying to work out what a blowjob is, whilst Christian has been manipulating those who won't do what anyone tells them. But we haven't won any BAFTAs even if half of Lionel Nimrod's Inexplicable World have done so. Maybe it's cos we want to throw toddlers into ponds. If nothing else you're about to find out who Tiny Mrs Collings is. And hopefully the furious back pedaling will save The Collings & Herrin Podcast . Or make the tension much worse.

      "description": "Retro AIOTM #12 - Back to 24th May 2010 to find out what was troubling the young idiots version of Richard Herring and his crew of misfits. Why not become a badger at http://goifasterstripe.com/badges or check out http://twitch.tv/rkherring to find out how far this fool has fallen in the last ten years. Thanks for supporting us by listening to this ancient tosh As It Occurs To Me: Series 2, Episode 2: Richard Herring audaciously attempts to rename five of the seven days of the week, in a way that will make for an easy rhyme to remember them by, but which might make it hard to arrange any actual meetings. His power struggle with double act partners past and present continues, but the real secrets are reserved for those brave souls who endured the heat and missed the football to pay to see the show live. Emma has a story that combines her love of celebrities and her love of poo, Dan wishes he was in Flight Of The Conchords and Christian takes on Billy Bragg and Gil Scott-Heron ensuring that the Venn Diagram of who understands which jokes in the show gets ever more complicated. Meanwhile Rich is a victim of more crime and is hoping elves will write the script so he can sit out in the sun, finally, just once before he dies. It's all post-post-post-post-post modern, which actually makes it quite old-fashioned in places. England won 3-1 by the way. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

      "description": "Retro AIOTM #11 all the way back 10 years and 12 days to May 17th 2010 to find out what the young whippersnapper Richard Herring and the team are up to. Will they be driving to Barnard Castle to test their eyesight or wishing they could get their hair cut? I doubt it, because they lived in the happy beforetimes. And yet still they complained, the dolts. As It Occurs To Me: Series 2, Episode 1: Sony nominated AIOTM (AIOTM) returns for its second series. In show one, 'Richard Merring' forms an uneasy coalition and progressive alliance with Dan Tetsell and Emma Kennedy in the hope that they can curb his worst excesses. But it's a spring clean and all the old favourites are being purged. No cumpkins, no Quantum Leap and definitely NO Tiny Andrew Collings (aside: not unless he can somehow sneak his way in). You'll have to listen to find out if Richard made his flight back from the island of Cornwall in time for the show (aside: he did), if the show won any awards (aside: it didn't), and if anything amusing has happened to Tetsell in the last five months (aside: it hasn't, though he does nearly fall asleep at one point in the show, due to the rigours of being a father to a young baby). Is Richard super famous in Liverpool? What is worse than finding five men's sperm in your jack o' lantern? And can a man ever truly be in love with a lift if they are speaking different languages? And what will happen if we say we're going to blow Robin Hood Airport sky high? We might have to wait to find out about that last one. Who cares anyway when Christian Reilly is on an impossible mission to sort out the Greek economy? It's brilliant (aside: it's not. It's shit). Hosted on Acast.

Rich is joined by the guest with the most appearances on RHLSTP, from Norwich, Adam Buxton. Recorded on the 8th April whilst the fate of the PM hung in the balance they make some bold predictions of how that is going to turn out (apologies if we got it wrong) and how the lockdown is affecting or failing to affect their largely dull lives. Plus Richard reveals some tragic news about his mind’s eye and a Lee and Herring story that he hasn’t even told Stewart about. Adam reveals secrets of competitiveness from his own double act and talks about his high-profile podcast guests.

      "description": "It’s coming up to Christmas in 2009 and the innocent young cast of AIOTM have no idea what will hit them in just 10 short years. And that’s for the best I suppose. As usual by listening you are giving funds to the justgiving heckle the virus charity and finally paying the cast for their work. See what madness Richard Herring is up to in 2020 by tuning in to http://twitch.tv/rkherring Podcast #9 and Richard is conflicted about whether he should be happy or sad that AIOTM has been nominated for a Loaded Lafta and what this means about his relationship with Jesus. Dan gets an unexpected gift from a stranger, whilst Emma is living in a cold and flooded flat, and Christian's mental breakdown seems to be surpassing that of even Herring himself. But while our musician rails against love, Rich is moving in with his girlfriend in order to replace his broken dishwasher and trying to sabotage Andrew Collings' career, even if success will only be a Pyrrhic victory. The world meanwhile goes crazy about Kay, Subo and the death of a rat and all we can do is quote Matthew 6 at it and hope that makes things better. All this is made harder by having to follow Stewart Lee who is clearly superior to us in every way. But has he been nominated for a Loaded Lafta? No, he hasn't. There's another reason for him being the best. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

He always wears a suit. There’s nothing unusual going on. His guest is just some guy from some old sketch show and the first Knight (that says Ni) on the podcast, Sir Michael Palin. Obviously Rich is in awe and on his best behaviour, but that won’t stop him bringing up one of Michael’s rare career disappointments and nearly derailing everything. But Michael is everything you’d hope for and you can find out what he got paid for his script being used in Sliding Doors, how the Fish Dance went down in North Korea, how Life of Brian might have been Python at its height, the perils of being a mud eater, how Mrs Palin ended up on Saturday Night Live, why Terry Jones was the heart of Python and how this remarkable friendship between writing partners was maintained right to the end. Plus the best impression of Cicero that you’re likely to hear. Will Richard end up in the diary and what terrible things will be said about him…? We will have to wait. Monthly badgers - your backstage interview includes Michael ad-libbing a brand new scene for Life of Brian which I would say is worth your monthly subscription to the end of time. So sign up to see this - we don’t get many emergency questions on stage, but he did a few in the dressing room. http://gofasterstripe.com/badges SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Thanks so much. In Show 6 of AIOTM , proceedings have been hijacked by the man from behind Rich in the queue in Waitrose (aiottmbritqiw!) but for how long? Rich reminisces about his childhood, Emma gives the backstage goss from The X Factor , Dan has leg boobs and Christian is being sarcastic about the remit of the show. Has Rich been eating 'man flesh', and will he or a tramp outside the theatre marry a 19 year-old in the audience? Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

      "description": "A chance to listen to this ragbag of a podcast originally broadcast starting in October 2009 and based on the stuff that had happened and occurred to Richard Herring in that week - written at speed, barely rehearsed. It’s better than you’d think it would be. And this time it comes with ads so we can raise some money to make more podcasts, finally pay the cast to help them through this time and put some money into the fund to help comedians with no work through this tricky time. And all you have to do is listen to it. We will release a new episode every Friday so you can relive a happier time. To support Emma Kennedy - BUY HER BOOKS To support Christian Reilly - BUY HIS DOWNLOAD To support Dan Tetsell - petition Hollyoaks for a return of his (admittedly dead) character As It Occurs To Me: Series 1, Episode 1 In the first episode of As It Occurs To Me , Richard discusses his week which includes a visit to Berlin to find out about David Hasselhoff 's potential to solve all the world's problems, Snow White's 8th and 9th dwarves, Emma Kennedy 's audition for Mamma Mia , Dan Tetsell nearly being sick on his baby, Channel 5 turning into an exploitative casino and how the ghost of Stewart Lee haunts him in his dreamscape. It's a solid start, but things can only get better. Surely. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

But the lack of it being gold, makes it gold. As always. His guest owes everything to her last RHLSTP appearance, it’s the multi-talented Rachel Parris. She reveals how all her impro shows are all very carefully scripted and chats about collusion with Debbie Magee, befriending Anna Kendrick on Twitter, the whirlwind year she has when her Mash Report pieces went super viral and whether her 6 weeks old marriage is holding together OK. Plus Richard pitches a new podcast based on regret and Rachel reveals how she was hit by anxiety in the wake of her momentous year. She also gamely defends Leicestershire even though she’s not mentioned as a notable resident of her home town on wikipedia. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

They take in whether childhood trauma leads to a life in comedy, whether comedy calms or aggravates the voices in our heads, wanting to throw babies downstairs, the dangers of looking at the next person up and wishing for what they have and whether it’s true that we can’t say anything any more.

His guest was also the final guest of the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe run where Richard tried to run the podcast into the ground (dare he do it again?) it’s John Kearns. It’s a giddy and self-indulgent podcast where most of the material is deemed too shoddy or contentious for broadcast, but takes in a possible return for a much-loved comedy hero, the possible return of Top Coppers, the leap of faith required to follow your comedy path, tracing Raymond Briggs, disappointing children at the Science Museum and whether John will be getting a lift home. It’s weird, it’s wonderful and it feels like the birth of an amazing, awkward, intergenerational double act. If you enjoy it half as much as Richard seems to then you should have a good time.

Never mind, local resident and inexpert quizzer Grace Petrie is here to convince him that Leicester is actually all right, despite all evidence to the contrary. They discuss how she accidentally became a protest singer, how it’s ultimately a good thing that her industry can’t box her up, the universality of teenage angst at school dances, the inspiring Hannah Gadsby, how social media is amazingly not the best place to have discussions about human rights and how to get around swearing on Radio 2.

They discuss the most terrifying children’s TV characters, being sacked for failing to dress priests, the wonder of Bernie Clifton, the strong women in Men Behaving Badly, why Caroline stopped doing Jonathan Creek and whether she’d return, what Richard will be buying her for her imminent birthday, why she’s worried about Martin Clunes touching her breast and what it’s like to be haunted by a ham-eating ghost. Plus Caroline sings her 1990s top 30 single beautifully, whilst Richard sings the theme to Dream Stuffings less beautifully. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Giddy from hunger, tiredness and having to behave properly for last week’s podcast, Rich is the drunkest he’s been in 2019 (even though he still hasn’t drunk a drop) and the podcast spirals in some unexpected and bizarre directions involving dabbling with pubic management, which five diseases should be cured by the Disease Genie, double diabetes, Biblical analysis and the signs of mental breakdown. Rich fancies a sleep halfway through, but bravely mainly continues to talk and to be honest, has little to no memory of what happened in the last twenty minutes, so that can be as much a surprise to him as it is to you.

      "description": "#223 Second Back at the Old Market in Hove for a second (separate) week and Richard has more disappointing reviews of local tourist attractions, plus news of a life-changing bin-based compensation. His guest is a man who is more Brighton than a stick of rock, it’s Stephen Grant. Stephen tells us how he came within a heartbeat of being in Top Gear and might also have been in The Office were it not for excellent advice from his (ex) manager. Also the pros and cons of being followed by a film crew during his first Edinburgh Fringe, the disappointment of not flying in an air ambulance and whether it’s more impressive to lose weight by accident or design. Some classic old Emergency Questions are pulled out of the bag and there’s a more serious discussion about whether comedians should write their own material. Another lovely tour podcast. Do check out the gig guide to see if the show is coming near to you. Check out Stephen’s Cyclist podcast here - http://cyclistpod.libsyn.com/ SUPPORT THE SHOW!

They discuss whether we are all just characters in a video game played by an increasingly bored teenager, the secret dangers of hot water bottles, the pranks played on Angela by her swinging father and how Richard could be sued by the people of Brighton for lip damage, why comedians can’t meditate and a Valentine’s Day gesture to rival a Ferrero Rocher pyramid.

With Flo and Joan the talk revolves around time travelling gang bangs, Bros’ Cheddar antics, double act rivalry and memories of Tring. With John, Richard is skittish from lack of sleep and counting down the time, but still manages to find out whether a plastic cup can substitute for false teeth and how the speaker of the House of Commons takes a shit.

With Arabella they chat about her show about her mother, being the first female Doctor, having David Tennant as a lodger, how the Fast Show cast came together, whether her Scottish accent cuts the mustard and they both fail to remember stuff about Bonjour la Classe effectively. Her bum did not look big in the throne.

Never mind, his guests are Rob Auton and Lee Ridley aka Lost Voice Guy. With Rob the discussion takes in working in advertising, Cold Feet, a shopping trolley full of items of the same colour and the worthlessness of existence given the infinity of time. Lee and Herring chat about what it’s like to win Britain’s Got Talent, what Simon Cowell is really like, the leap of faith that persuaded a self-conscious man who was unable to speak to attempt stand-up, the most ridiculous things strangers have asked him about his disability and whether anyone would ever heckle a man with no voice.

There is some discussion of who from Lee and Herring has had the more successful career (no spoilers) and whether there is any danger of a Slattery style breakdown from doing too many episodes of Pointless, whether House of Games will ever offer psychological training, how to get into the dying medium of TV and what is an appropriate height differential for lovers..

Spencer talks about where he gets his crazy ideas and how to make comedy from mundane objects in life, his tricky first gigs as Herbert Clunkerdunk and what his fifth season would involve. Janey and Ashley talk about how they have conquered the internet and ingratiated themselves with celebs (even if they don’t always recognise them), the dangerous stupidity of taking on either of them on social media, their refusal to compromise for TV folk and whether Catcher in the Rye is a price worth paying for not having John Lennon any more.

      "description": "RHLSTP Edinburgh 2019 #3 Jena Friedman and Phil Wang - Raisin Drip - Rich was looking forward to being able to use his topical satirical eye to look at the news, until he looked at the news, but he decided to plough on anyway. His guests are Jena Friedman and Phil Wang. With Jena he discusses the reasons behind American gun crime, whether political comedy does any good, interviewing John McAfee and what kind of people have seen ghosts and what kind haven’t. Phil Wang is grilled about his sartorial choices on Taskmaster, the advantages and disadvantages of being in the Footlights, the unbridled joy of receiving unexpected francs, what Rich would be like as a stepdad.

No matter because he’s got a brilliant line-up of guests: Lucy Beaumont and the Scummy Mummies. He talks to Lucy about Hull and Pocklington, sexual super powers, the candour of Maureen Lipman, encounters with ghost animals and alien balloons, the living Hell of marriage and children and ingesting your twin in utero. The Scummy Mummies discuss their fabulous podcast, Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s frustrating inability to have a female child, the infamous rivalry between Jossy’s Giants and Rentaghost, why it’s better to come to the Fringe without your kids and the impressive number of shows they’ve already seen.

The King of Edinburgh is back for his 25th Fringe, though he is feeling under the weather thanks to his bloody stupid decision to breed and his possibly hubristic decision to play a 400 seater venue. But never mind he’s got two of the Festival’s most interesting acts to kick off this cavalcade of 21 podcasts in 24 days, Laura Lexx and Tony Law. Two guests on the same day? What? With Laura there’s discussion about ice lollies, whether global warming is a more pressing issue than Brexit, the repercussions of the Edinburgh accommodation crisis, defective chocolate bars and Johnny machines. And Tony chats about the contrasting previous appearances on the podcast, whether terrifyingly drunk or mind-bendingly sober and will it be third time, unwired? Well it’s Tony, so obviously not. Plus the differences between comedians in for the long haul and those hoping for fame, the craziness of Canadian comics, trying to put your children off performing and the acts creating unique shows full of risk. And how does he feel about turning 50? It’s good to be back.

Rich is at the Henley Festival and is up against the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, who prove to be much more popular and louder than him, but his audience is small and enthusiastic, even if he risks losing some of them by being rude about this weird and posh town. His guest is We Know Where You Live’s Fiona Allen. She talks about working for Tony Wilson at the Hacienda, the unusual job of her grandfather, whether Michael Parkinson Senior is the most evil man on the planet, secretly delightful, disgusting household chores, whether it’s best to be up front on a date, why she knew Smack the Pony was going to be a hit (and whether it will return), British films and why so many disappear into the ether, returning to stand up as a more mature (but not necessarily more mature) performer and paying her children to empty the dishwasher.

Richard chats with a therapist and a photographer in the front row before bringing on his triumvirate of guests, Danielle Ward, Michael Legge and Margaret Cabourn-Smith, otherwise known as the Do The Right Thing podcast. They discuss celebrity snogs and failed celebrity snogs, the attempt to move their podcast to TV, what happens when you meet your dad in a dark room (not photography based), giving birth to the children of Tiny Andrew Collings, why Richard will probably never be a successful actor and a lot about death.

Also working with Rik and Ade on the Comic Strip and how the show must go on even after a blow to the head.

Richard is back at the Bath Komedia and chats about the planet that was discovered here and the various names it had, but it doesn’t go on too long, cos he has a great guest and has to drive home, it’s Bath resident and daughter of an assassin, Kerry Howard. The conversation revolves around meeting Ken Campbell without knowing who he was, the varying successes of the BBC’s season of revived sitcoms, an unusual pregnancy, how comedy might be cooked in the womb, how Russell Howard convinced Kerry that she was a good goal-keeper, inappropriate teachers and what happened to sketch shows. And an interjection from the audience makes Richard wonder if it was a mistake to bring the show to the provinces, It wasn’t. There will be loads more shows on the road - come along if you can.

RHLSTP tours to the Bath Komedia and Rich manages to find some tourists who are disgruntled about the Roman Baths that gave the city its name. Let’s face it, they’re just not as good as modern baths. But Rich is delighted to welcome one of the greatest men in the West Country if not the world, it’s Peter Lord. And he’s not only brought Morph with him, but has a crack at making another as he talks. He’s magic, It’s a fascinating chat about how Aardman went from two kids messing around at their kitchen table to running a huge studio making films, TV shows and adverts. Find out about the chicken secrets behind the Sledgehammer video, what it’s like living next door to polar bears, how Plasticine is a magnet for fire, moonwalking at the Oscars and what Aardman was nearly called. It’s an inspiring story about what is possible if you have the imagination and the luck and a little bit of nepotism. And Rich repays a thirty year old debt (without interest).

Richard is incredibly and justifiably rude about the fifth worst city on the planet, but does he secretly love the place? His guest is local boy made good; author, journalist and defender of Wolverhampton (apart from the racist bits) Sathnam Sanghera. The pair discuss what it was like to work on Live TV (with an amazing revelation about Topless Darts); what it was like being an ordinary person going to Oxbridge; sharing a flat with John Oliver; the universality of the story of Bros and whether one of them has had work done; the figurative and literal madness of family life; and losing religion (and sometimes hair).

      "description": "RHLSTP #200: Richard Herring - Pennsylvania Polka. It's episode 200 of the podcast and the end of Series 14, two insane milestones for this ramshackle lump of podcast. And to celebrate this occasion there's a record breaking fourth appearance from the grandson of a Batman, Adam Buxton. Adam sets the agenda from the start, bearing gifts, mocking stone-clearing like a philistine, revealing what 1995 Richard Herring had somehow discovered annoyed Stewart Lee, and attempting a slightly underwhelming tribute to Groundhog Day. Plus find out how Nile Rodgers responded to jokes by kids; why a head in a jar has to bring its own cloth; whether it's possible to have a film set at Stonehenge without the stones being knocked over at some point; and whether child-men in their fifties have to finally grow up. Plus some extraordinary epistles from World War One and how fields with barbed wire can still cause injury even today. Thanks to everyone who has supported this endeavour over the last 200 episodes and six years. Hopefully we can continue to move onwards and upwards. We will be touring the podcast in 2019 (as well as another run at the Leicester Square Theatre on Mondays from 4th February to 1st April. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

      "description": "RHLSTP #199: Terry Hall - Terry Hall Hall. Richard has finally won a TV quiz show and I am afraid he will never stop talking about it again, but he's nervous as Hell because one of his heroes is on the podcast and he's sure he'll screw it up, it's ex-Fun Boy Three-er Terry Hall. They discuss the dynamics and disagreements that come with collaboration, the nostalgic sexual time waves of early 1980s fashion, the one occasion when Terry laughed, being mistaken for a ventriloquist by the taxman, why the greatest album of all time only made it to 95 in the charts and why Terry didn't end up as a hairdresser. There's some serious chat about sexual abuse and depression and how Terry had dealt with these traumas and some cruel assessments of the town of Coventry. And can the power of RHLSTP finally get the album Home to number 1 where it belongs? No, I don't think so. It doesn't seem to be commercially available.

Richard chats with the audience and struggles to find anyone who works in IT, but discovers a human interest story that would be moving and inspirational in the hands of anyone else, but Herring manages to get laughs instead, the monster. HIs guest this week is actor, writer and a man who might be able to take on Michael Palin for the title the nicest man in show business, Sanjeev Bhaskar. They talk about working with a tiny James Bolam; Richard's drunken debauchery and theft at a corporate gig in the early 90s; how Sanjeev's big break rested on the toss of a coin; the real life origin story of The Kumars and how a TV executive attempted to ruin it; and how Sanjeev ended up marrying his own grandmother. Loads more stuff in this one including Brian Blessed, working with Pythons, pert nipples (I must have told that one before) and becoming friends with Roger Moore.

Rich finally gets to dedicate a whole podcast to his quizzing failures and to envy Lucy for the number of extra shows she's been on. We hear about behind the scenes on the Weakest Link; how Lucy and Jenny met on a record breaking episode of The Chase; who knows the most about their home town; foot fetishism; sexual awakenings during Hi-de-Hi!; how creating a quiz show can make you a millionaire; and which celebrity from Croydon Richard would most like to have sex with.

They discuss the beauty of being allowed to be silly in a serious world; whether Tom Daley should be sponsored to go to Pride; the Daily Express making mountains out of molehills; how a TV chef did not appreciate a joke about chicken jerk; and how envy can eat you up and how age can soften its grip. We also learn about Joe's new projects, including the Great British Sewing Bee, and hear from Esme, one of the judges of that show, who is in our front row and is rather well refreshed after a day out with Joe.

His guest is a woman he worked with just four days before recording, though she seems to have forgotten all about it, Amanda Abbington. Can she name the cast of Man Stroke Woman? How many times has she appeared on The Bill? What is Nicholas Lyndhurst's acting secret? Has she played Give Us A Clue with Una Stubbs? And Rich recounts how he has twice failed auditions to appear in shows with her. Rich makes a pitch to appear in Death In Paradise, which might not quite work out for him and there's chat about UFOs, sex robots and more evidence that drinking alcohol might not be the best preparation for a long-form interview.

He always hated podcasts and was just using you to get back on the telly. But while he's waiting for the phone to start ringing there's time for another chat, this time with the journalist and broadcaster James O'Brien. Recorded on a particularly depressing week, but maybe not as depressing as the world you're living in as you listen to it, there's some serious dissection of Brexit, Trump and how fake news and indignation have stymied debate. Find out about James' time as a showbiz reporter, his investigations into the truth behind Interval and more from his book 'How To Be Right In A World Gone Wrong'. Is there any hope? Are we learning what it was like to live through the rise of Hitler? Has James ever tried to suck his own cock (don't know, forgot to ask)? And is the way through all this just to drink eight craft beers and let the anti-depressants cheer you up? And there's a revelation about his Red Dwarf/Star Trek knowledge that will destroy his credibility forever...

But lucky us (apart from the obvious bad luck) because we get to hear about Nish shitting himself on camera watching a man get down and dirty with a horse; being the worst Taskmaster contestant ever; the best use of a House Of Games trophy; and what it's like to lose it on Question Time. How's Brexit going to turn out and why can't Brexiteers stop themselves leaving? Plus the unpredicted but satisfying success of The Mash Report. If you're hoping Michael Sheen might pop up as a surprise guest at the last minute then I am afraid you will be disappointed (hopefully we can get him to come down in 2019) but there is a brief ray of light as he sends us a message.

Richard gets pathetically drunk on just one bottle of Beer 52 beer and is scarcely able to remember how to speak, let alone recall what was discussed, but it includes a lot of racist attempts to do the English accent by Rose; plus what it's like to be up the tallest building in the Southern hemisphere; 'women's things'; an attempt to understand millennials; waiting for Burt Bacharach; watching your pet die; and the New Zealand version of The Horny Time Traveller.

      "description": "RHLSTP #190: Greg Davies - Bowl of Cheese. It's a showdown battle of who is best, Richard or Hugh Jassburn - in book form at least, but Richard is keen to bring back one of his all time favourite guests: the magnificent beast and Master of Tasks that is Greg Davies. They discuss schoolday soilings; dick-lifters; being related to a ghost; little Alex Horne; the exquisite pain of laughing when you're not meant to; sex with teddies; the saddest of bachelor meals; the death of two fathers; the devastating surprise of ageing; what it takes to be in your fifties; the weirdest group of celebrities to gather at Buckingham Palace; and the wondrous comedy of commitment to joyous stupidity. It's eye-wateringly funny stuff with two childish old men who should know better.

Richard has been publicising his latest book, but it's not popular with canines, but at least he's got daytime DJs asking some wholly inappropriate questions. His guests this week are Hannah, Taylor and a slightly familiar Catie, from the Drunk Women Solving Crime podcast. Can the inebriated females solve a mystery that has remained mysterious for sixteen years? What crimes has Richard had carried out upon his small person, can he and his wife get through this podcast without resorting to divorce? What kind of crimes do they have on the Isle Of Wight and how effective are the police? Plus sex robots, pond-pushing and the beautiful autonomy of podcasting.

Toby demonstrates his skill of being able to name the character and episode of Doctor Who that any actor appeared on, chats about interviewing Doctor Who actors before they die, and Rich reveals that he has worked with both Baker Doctor Who's and who is his favourite. But it's not just Doctor Who. They also talk about Servalan from Blake's Seven. Before returning to some more Doctor Who based chat. With a brief diversion about the great lost Spike Milligan play and how Toby was voted North-West comedy hero above Dodd, Kay, Coogan and Aherne, plus his remarkable 21 year tenure of one of the country's best comedy clubs, XS Malarkey.

Jessica has been in a fight at the festival and recounts tales of time holes, Nightmare Live, a great new TV format, and sharing train rides with a stalker (of other people). Holly tells tales of being the world's worst bridesmaid, finding your inner clown, what happens when Posh Spice retweets you, and her plans to visit her namesake.

It's the end of the series and Rich wonders how tourists in Kings Cross will feel if their last action on earth is to queue to stand by a fictional wall. His guest is a man who has a lot of stories about how he got into comedy, it's Mark Steel. They chat about eating pork pies with Joseph Heller, helping failed escapologists, an idea for a brand new Radio 4 panel show, whether you can stand for political office and still be a comedian, the extraordinary story of Mark's birth parents, what it's like having a child going into comedy, and getting your own back on a snooty Darwin expert. It's a fabulous end to what has surely been the best series yet. Will the commissioners bring the show back? Yes of course they will - more in September (and a couple of specials coming out before then too).See Rich on tour: www.richardherring.com/ohfrig/tourBecome a Dripster and help us make more podcasts: http://d.rip/richard-herringBecome a monthly badger and help us make more podcasts: www.gofasterstripe.com/badgesSign up for renewable energy and receive £50 credit and probably save money on your bills with Bulb: https://bulb.co.uk/refer/richard234 Hosted on Acast.

Richard's guest is a man who has played all theatrical parts, but most notably the part of Brian Blessed. I couldn't even begin to describe what happened on this extraordinary night, except to say it is was a bona fide happening. Try and predict how many words Richard will say in this. It's a free form and extraordinary, yet sometimes beautiful and inspiring, journey through the career, philosophy and madness of a man who might be the greatest living Englishmen. How much of it is true? I can't tell you. But at least some of it. Includes sticking it to Picasso, toileting on a mountain, biting umbilical cords, working with the young Peter O'Toole and Patrick Stewart, never dying and probably some other stuff. I can't tell you. I had a little nap through most of it. Worth watching the video version to see my torture on what was one of the best experiences of my life. This podcast is absolutely unbeatable.

Also discussed are meeting Noel Gallagher; running marathons with the bloke off My Parents Are Aliens; being on a plane with Bez; and doing a Muppet Christmas Carol in 6 minutes. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Rich forgot to do a bit of his tour show for the people of Cardiff so we start with a comity contest, which unexpectedly leads to the podcast being blocked by penguins. Rich's guest this week is the laid back, all-round genius Mackenzie Crook. Will Rich screw things up as badly as last time he had someone from The Office on? Not quite, but he gives it a fair go. They chat about double-teaming Muppets, the best metal detector, why UK sitcoms are so short-lived, remaking The Office, choosing a field in Suffolk over a ship in the Caribbean, how easy it is to ride a tube train and what happened with Sex Lives Of The Potato Men. All this and Rich has a barely noticeable spot on his nose. No wonder he's out of sorts. The twit. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Rich's daughter seems to be on her way to a mediocre career in comedy and he could not be more proud, but he doesn't have time to show off too much as RHLSTP is welcoming its second member of parliament, Jess Phillips. There's chat about the positive side of Brexit, the impressive thing about UKIP, why the left wing are at a disadvantage when it comes to changing things, why International Men's Day is not advancing the cause of men, the disappointing representation of lifts in popular movies, the truth about whether Jess told Diane Abbott to f*** off and whether it's best to have kids young or old. Also who is the sexiest Tory MP? Plus how safe are our elected representatives, and are MPs as bad as everyone makes out? And Rich announces his intention to stand for parliament. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Technology delivers a cruel blow to Richard as it deletes his carefully crafted opening monologue about Cheddar Man, but he has a crack at it from memory. Richard is giddy from tiredness caused by nasty bugs from his stupid children and his guest, Danielle Ward, had a complicated and scary birth only 13 weeks ago, so it's no surprise that things go a bit giddy and occasionally over the top. How many revelations about Prince Andrew and Dame Judy Dench will make it to air? Not very many is my guess.

Find out what it's like to work as an economic researcher at the South Korean embassy (when you know nothing about the economy or Korea); which member of Lee and Herring Danielle wrote to in 1996; the difficulty of transferring a successful podcast to television; and what the most popular TV show of 1970 was. Find out about two moments from the life of Benedict Cumberbatch; how Rich bonded with Adrian Chiles; and why Danielle loves Debbie McGee.

      "description": "RHLSTP #161: Johann Hari - Cannibal Chicken. The question of ham hands versus suncream armpits has gone international and been introduced to a new generation in the most charming of ways. But hat confusion, decade old Big Brother news and chicken restaurants aside, it's a pretty serious podcast in which journalist Johann Hari discusses his fascinating new book, 'Lost Connections'. Are our views on depression and antidepressants correct or do we need to look at these subjects in a new way? Johann discusses how an encounter with an apple made him consider the importance of listening to our symptoms, plus the power that people have to overcome the systems that can make them sad or even give up hope entirely. Is Rich's dad crazy for wanting to engage with strangers or is Rich insane for being disconnected from his neighbours? Do possessions bring us happiness? Do lesbian monkey orgies have anything to teach us? And what can bring Muslims, punks and gay men together? No emergency questions. Unless you consider the future of the human race an emergency.

Richard is overly proud of himself for having created a new book of Emergency Questions, but luckily there is someone on hand who will give them short shrift, it's the comedian with the soul of a poet, Reginald D Hunter. He discusses the one thing that is better than a shrek when it comes to improving existing franchises; how Reg did and didn't break his leg; how comedic genius can be passed on via the bladder; the ultimate victory of sibling rivalry; the slow realisation of the truth about OJ Simpson; how vanity is the greatest destroyer of men; being the fourth funniest person in your family; and many more surprising revelations regarding relativity. Richard worries about ageing and death, but Reginald does not. It's a revelatory chat with a comedian who possibly unwittingly inspired this whole podcast series.

Rich's daughter has made quite a radical life choice, but hopefully is a reincarnation of someone who will make the family a lot of money (if only we can prove it). This week it's a welcome return for one of the worst guests we've ever had on RHLSTP (and I am saying that because that's what he says about me on Pointless), it's the charmingly offensive giant, Richard Osman. Will Osman realise where he's gone wrong with his TV shows and finally commission Richard to write and sing the theme tune? Will Pointless ever take the money and head to Channel 4? What will Osman say about Rich's mum this time? Why can't chocolate manufacturer's put aside their differences? How big is a glass? Is it OK to propose to someone over Twitter? How many times can you lose on Pointless and still hold your head high? What do the Chinese think of Osman? Is it better to be single in your twenties or your forties?

Armando reveals a surprising friendship with a 1990s pop group and the dark underside of Michael Palin before trying to ascertain who is worst: Weinstein, Stalin or James Corden. Rich gets busted about his behaviour at the \"Death of Stalin\" premiere and there's lots of chat about this excellent film and how being a director has changed Iannucci into a megalomaniac. Plus find out what happened when Armando started to learn the piano in his 40s and his near death experiences on holiday and how he has once again managed to copy all of Richard's ideas and pass them off as his own.

      "description": "RHLSTP #151: Ellie Taylor - Catching Clouds. RHLSTP is back and the sky has changed colour and the first of the gang has died, so Richard is a bit unsettled and sad. But on we plough until our own inevitable deaths. The guest today previously worked for Isis, it's Ellie Taylor, who claims to have grown up in Brentwood, but she doesn't know much about it or trampolining. Like you'd expect. They talk about the faces you pull when you're modelling for Matalan, being apparated in a box, the great Josh paedo postman betrayal, why cats are better than babies, having a heart made of diamonds, and much too much about genitals, but then some stuff about the cute things kids say to make up for the rudeness. Richard is so tired that his brain either says everything he is thinking or can't formulate basic words (so no real change there), but luckily Ellie is eloquent as he bumbles around the questions of body image and perceived attractiveness. Plus he gets to ask questions from the brand new EQ app! See all of Ellie's tour dates here: http://socomedy.co.uk/artist/ellie-taylor/ SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Perhaps it would have been for the best. But instead he's back for the 150th official episode of the show that the Cool Kids call RHLSTP with one of his all-time favourite guests, Sara Pascoe. She has written a phenomenal book called Animal which you really should buy https://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0571325246/comedyguide-21/ for all teenage girls, all teenage boys and everyone else too. There's some pretty serious chat about the chemistry of love, biology, abortion, the future of the world, whether things are getting better or worse and terrible human nature. But it's contemplative and positive and proves that Richard isn't actually the worst man on the planet, plus there's fun stuff about Just A Minute in a brain scanning machine and Sunday Brunch (with surprise guest) and a brilliant new game show where there's guaranteed to be one woman on every week. Plus all the Emergency Questions lead us to serious answers. It's an amazing end to what has surely been the best series of RHLSTP so far. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

They chat about their mutual inability to draw 8s; and hours (and relationships) lost to Civilisation II; the way tragedy (or not) can shape a comedian; where you would seek release if you were the only person left in the world; the tricky balancing act of making sure the right people are at your funeral; how we will view ourselves in 10 years time; and what our wives might think of us now.

His second guest is Edinburgh Comedy Prize nominee, Jon Robbins (sorry) John Robins.

      "description": "RHEFP 2017 #3: Iain Stirling and Jason Manford - The Main Thing Is Ricky Gervais Didn't Win. Rich is mortified about having accidentally crashed someone else's show and is thinking of becoming someone who pays to sit in a hairdressers. But the good news is that Colin is back to remind his guests of times that things have gone wrong for them. Rich's first guest personally knows many of the people that Rich not-so-secretly lusts over at CBeebies - it's Iain Stirling. They chat about working alongside puppets (in their own different ways), how Love Island has turned Iain into a huge Edinburgh smash, the tragedy behind the Amazing Bubble Man and whether somehow Richard might be Iain's dad. Then Richard is joined by the Radio Times Comedy champion and also champion poor time keeper, Jason Manford to chat about the old bamboo, setting up comedy clubs, bizarre coincidences and I think a misunderstanding about what a human centipede involves.

Richard is so close to becoming the Radio Times Comedy Champion that he can almost taste it, which will just make his ultimate failure all the more painful and thus amusing, but luckily he almost shat his pants on a children's roundabout. HIs guest went one step further than that, it's the wonderful comedy genius James Acaster. They discuss how hot chocolate is not a flavour, sky diving in slip-ons, the dangers of eating chicken nuggets for a bet, the behind-the-scenes disaster that happened on the Conan show, how a rubbish ghost train was made more scary, shooting Private Pike in the face, crashing cars and the ace sitcom We The Jury.

The King has returned and he's at the spooky New Theatre Grand Hall where the Masons get up to all sorts of mysterious time-travelling. And Richard is very excited to be welcoming comedy legends the Doug Anthony All Stars, Paul, Tim and Paul. There's lots of chat about the Edinburgh Fringe of the eighties, the point where comedy and tragedy meet, what happens when you become the carer for your comedy partner, what happens if you never wash your clothes, the Doug who became a diplomat, how Jerry Sadowitz terrorised the public, and curing rectal cancer. Sorry the first minute or so got lost, but I have attempted to recreate it (and it was nothing of any worth). Plus there's a beautiful song at the end which is going to leave you wondering why the audience is laughing, but suffice to say what was happening was very funny indeed. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Richard contemplates the now trickier commute to work that he has thanks to being forced to move to the country because he is 50, before introducing veteran comedian Brendon Burns and a man with only one credit, Craig Quartermaine. It's a more contemplative RHLSTP than usual, as the two Australians discuss the racial issues that many of their countrymen refuse to confront and how comedy can deal with questions of race (especially if a loud and mouthy bloke is teamed up with a quieter and indigenous one). Find out how this unlikely pair got together, how they reluctantly formed a double act, what makes a double act work and the awkwardness that both comedians revel in and have to cope with in their daily life and from people who have seen their show. It's a fascinating insight into guilt, embarrassment and the horrors of imperialism and how difficult it is to confront these harsh truths. Luckily it's funny too. Though sometimes uncomfortably so.

It's the first time the pair have spoken in over 60 months and it would be foolish to deny that there might be come tensions bubbling beneath (and all over) the surface, but there's still time for some banter that will take you back to the glory days of 2008-2011. Armed with emergency questions and an emergency folder of cherished tabloid memories the pair attempt to discuss the country's worst serial killers, the Mitfords, the evil of Cecil Parkinson, the debt they owe each other, the unresolved sexual tension (at least at the start of the evening), the disappointment of Northampton, decent and indecent proposals, whether it's OK to add cartoons to The Human Centipede and what the best kind of tape is.

His guest is someone who he used to only be able to speak to in drunken awe at early 1990s BBC Radio Light Entertainment parties, Paul Merton. They discuss their similarly comedy-nerdy teenage years, the early days of the alternative comedy circuit where Alexei Sayle's stream of swearing might be followed by flying fish or slowly melting ice. Can Paul remember the very first routine that helped him on the road to stardom (and partially define his persona)? - you bet a fortnight's holiday in Benidorm he can, and it's magical!

      "description": "Wells Comedy Festival Extra: Bec Hill - Passing The Baton. Rich has risked the wrath of everyone in his home town of Cheddar by travelling beyond the horizon to Wells, where the crazy people dwell, and doing a special podcast for the inhabitants. But don't worry Cheddar - he mocks the Wells insane asylum dwellers and won't let them get away with being called a city. He is armed with a copy, fresh off the presses of the new Emergency Questions book, which will be winging its way to kickstarter backers imminently and be available to buy at gigs and (very soon) from www.gofasterstripe.com. His guest is Australian exponent of the Japanese storytelling technique of Kamishibai, [citation needed] Bec Hill. They discuss what it is like to be married on stage (not to each other); unpleasant experiences with toilet rolls; and the strange way we allow a stranger with an X-Ray machine to focus; Adelaide's tallest building; being halfway somewhere; and find out if Bec has ever irked a postman. Plus some big news for Rich, inevitably sullied by inappropriate chat about genitalia. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

They talk about how it's almost impossible to parody the new President of the United States, but the effective way that Peter managed it and his fears and plans should there be repercussions from the thin-skinned bellend. Also lots of chats about the two Brian Bs (Blessed and Butterfield) and how a stellar cast does not always lead to a commission.

Richard quizzes his audience to find how little they have done with their lives, before introducing the comedian's comedian and avant garde comedy genius, Simon Munnery. In a frank interview Simon reveal the unwritten truth of Steve Coogan's 1992 Edinburgh Fringe hospital visit, how Mark Lamarr did the bravest thing ever witnessed on stage, how Simon met his wife as a voice in the darkness during a gig that was spiralling out of control, setting up a restaurant that doesn't serve food, and what it was like to play Malcolm Hardee's legendary Tunnel Club. There's a bit where he looks like he might try to punch Richard to the floor, but instead they settle the battle of the aged Alpha males in the most manly way possible. Munnery is the comedy god, but who is the strongest? It's a thrilling podcast in many ways, and some of it maybe better watched than listened to, but luckily you can do both. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

A nuclear physicist is on hand to discuss the chemistry of jumping into a pool of something and Ed has to decide if he'd save Rich from crucifixion.

Rich discovers that someone from US TV is in the audience and considers sending the guest home so he can audition for a stand-up special, but Chris Addison is backstage and it would be rude to do that after he's bothered to come in. The pair chat about Wikipedia-based factual inaccuracies, the true story of how Chris was nearly Doctor Who, the technical realities of sewing people together anus to mouth, some thoughtful exposition about a world with realistic robots, whether opera is obviously shit or if it's actually good, why American TV produces the results that the UK seemingly can't, as well as having a smack down between the average Herring and Addison fans. And can Rich Columbo Chris at the end? Product placement courtesy of http://www.hiphops.cards/ - seriously, check out the guy doing the song about how to play the game. It's magic! SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Caitlin discusses her ambitious plans to kickstart the cancelled yet award-winning Raised By Wolves (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/raisedbywolves/save-the-wolves), (the show has been bumped up in the schedule so apologies for any minor disruptions of running jokes), how she nearly broke into Kate Moss' house, why you shouldn't give an 18 year-old a TV show, possibly the most unconvincing ghost story so far, and how she used numerology to help her choose her name.

It's the end of the series (but there will be bonus audio podcasts from the Great Yorkshire Fringe next week) and Richard is frankly astonished by the popularity of his final guest, given he has to literally check his name on a pad before introducing him, it's Elis James. Rich makes the Welshman feel at home by talking to him in his own language before discussing the famous people who've come from Carmarthen and the impact of the bridge over Blue Street. They compete to discover the worst hotel in Swansea and Elis wins by a toothbrush. Also find out how James' act has been ruined by Welsh football success, what we thought of the Ghostbusters controversy (I know that was a long time ago now) and who will have the funniest comedy hybrid child. And who is more oppressed, the Welsh or women? Or Welsh women? Plus Richard's attempt to get involved with Elis' next sitcom backfires spectacularly, but at least he has his awards speech all ready now. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Richard is reeling from a celebrity encounter and being outsmarted by a 3 year-old heckler, but at least he has a plan to finance the rest of the RHLSTP (rhlstp). His guest is neither an estate agent, a footballer or an Elizabethan comptroller. He was in Miranda though. It's Tom Parry. The pair discuss the lengths that you would have to go to to out-vegan a vegan, why someone from Wolverhampton shouldn't advertise toothbrushes, another amazing kite story, the woes of the Labour party and what it's like to work under the dictatorial heel of Robert Webb. Also if you've ever wondered if Tom Parry has tried sushi then you're in for a treat. And here's hoping Windsor Davies hasn't succumbed to the curse of 2016 so you can still make the important choice that we're all having to make about him. Some nice stuff about directing comedy and the insecurities, competitiveness and joys of working with other comedians and whether you ever get too old to dick around. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

The pair bring out the best worst in each other again, alternating between inappropriate chat about wangs and fufus and serious topics like the rise of anti-intellectualism, the imminent destruction of the planet and what motivates anyone to betray a living God. Also what would you do if you had the chance to destroy a space ship where a small majority of the aliens were evil? Should Dirty Britcom Confessions be seen as a compliment?

This week's guest is the former Westlife obsessive, Sofie Hagen. Luckily we're in a post-Brexit world now, allowing Rich freedom to let everyone know his true thoughts about Denmark and the disappointment that is the talked-up Copenhagen. They discuss what constitutes creepiness from a stranger, what's going on with the Danish alphabet, what happens when a fan is more famous than the person they stalked and Rich gives Sofie some important lessons in badger-identification and the British Royal Family, and kites lead us to some unexpected places.

They discuss Graham's first sitcom, why it is flawed and what he learned from it, the impact of the Brexit vote (which was really quite recent when we recorded this), the only funny joke in Zoolander 2, the farce of another American attempt to make The IT Crowd and whether it was a good thing that Richard once wrote nine sitcom episodes in ten weeks.

Richard is reduced to tears of laughter during a very inappropriate bit of chat (but is it really that funny, or is he just tired?) and after that catharsis there is some serious late night chat about success and working with other people, before the pair wonder about buying a stunt kite.

Starstruck and clearly in disbelieving awe, Rich flounders around and mainly embarrasses himself, but luckily Mr Cross is able to come up with some amazing riffed comedy about frozen vegetables, Abraham and taking cocaine near President Obama, whilst getting a bit more serious about Donald Trump, the responsibilities of fatherhood, why Richard should probably not take hard drugs, the benefits of the middle-aged sketch show and David's part in the creation of Kickstarter. Richard hoped that he would so impress David that they would become good friends and could appear in Doctor Dolittle 3 together as method-acted monkeys, but I think it's safe to say that that will not happen. Cross put away an impressive amount of bitter during this podcast and still remains focused and coherent, but clearly needed the toilet near the end, which turns into a battle of the obstinately pedantic 1990s underrated sketch show stars.

In the face of horrible world events and future uncertainty for the UK, Richard recounts how his wife distracted him from the horror in an unexpected way, before introducing former pole-dancer and oil rig worker, Marcus Brigstocke. They discuss an impressions battle with Kevin Spacey, the full script of Love Actually, the second worst thing that Clement Freud ever did and Marcus provides a scintillating new emergency question. Find out the many reasons Marcus got expelled from schools, why he is glad he is not part of the governing class and which puppet Richard would like to violate now. More discussion about the West London phone book of 1989 and the science of a swimming pool full of custard. Plus the chance to find out what the Wales score was at half-time in the final group match of the Euros. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Rich interviews a member of his audience and it's going so well he almost decides to bump his guest, but in the end relents and brings on the battle rapper turned stand-up turned actor and author, Ben Bailey Smith. It's a frank, fascinating and unusually sensitive chat taking in growing up in North London as a geeky mixed race kid, why it's not fair to use talent to get ahead of the other talentless stand-ups, working with Ricky Gervais, how producer Ben helped keep Doc's career on track (and why hasn't he done the same for Richard) and trying to work out why Doc Brown's family are such a hotbed of artistic skill. Find out what you have to do to get on to CBeebies and what Doc would jump into a pool of and if he's capable of spotting the colour purple.

His guest is from Sunderland and thus the mortal enemy of the Middlesbrough-spawned Herring family, it's charming and multi-talented Lauren Laverne! They chat about what it's like to become a pop star whilst you're still at college, roadies, how to skip PE lessons and how to spend long drives in the country's biggest limo. Also Lauren reveals her special place in the history of Shaun of the Dead, 10 O'Clock Live and why it didn't take off and whether she'd have sex with Robert the Robot from Justin's House (and whether he'd have sex with her).

Richard finds a bona fide cool kid in the audience and inexpertly attempts to mock him (you'd think he'd be better at comedy after all these years, but no), before introducing a force of nature and veritable river of consciousness, Tony Law, in his new mutton-chopped, ice-cream eating, alcohol-shunning, heavenly body impersonating incarnation. It's like his brain is a radio and someone is constantly swivelling the dial so that one moment you're on history, then fantasy, then insanity and then pinpoint sane philosophy. It's a discombobulating journey to go on, especially if, like Richard, you're getting a bit tired, but Herring gamely attempts (and largely fails) to get some questions in. In the end he more or less gives in, but Law is an unstoppable force of nature and cannot be silenced. Though the fear is that, at any point, something might happen to upset the fragile mental balance that somehow remains teetering on equilibrium... and that thing might very well be Desert Island Dicks. Finally, when the conversation turns to the supernatural things start to make sense. But Richard is knocked out and defeated and was right to say he wasn't looking forward to writing this blurb.

Richard is back (in his weightier incarnation) and has forgotten how to do this, but is excited about the possibilities of growing body parts in pigs, but worried about the implications of penis transplants, so it's business as usual, but with some new (but the same) emergency questions. His guest is the Wild Man of radio (and must always be referred to as such), Iain Lee. The pair discuss the pointless 17 year grudge that has hung over them, their mutual envy and the disastrous filmed meeting in 2001 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dakeVejvR3I), but they are united by their relative lack of success compared to their nineties contemporaries and after all this time attempt to heal the rift betwixt them. In an attempt to fill in Iain's early life on Wikipedia they discuss the perils of going to a school named after William Herschel, what it was like living in the town where Buddy's Song was filmed, and how to embarrass yourself in front of Roger Daltry. Richard tries to steer the Monkees-based conversation towards Metal Mickey (no doubt to discuss if it would be cheating to have sex with him), but Lee skilfully swerves and ends up talking about Monkey instead. There is also a frank discussion about whether the BBC were right or clearly wrong to sack Lee and the effects this had on his career and psyche. Good to be back. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

It's the 100th Leicester Square Theatre Podcast and the last in this series, so we've flown a special guest in all the way from America at the licence fee payer's expense, it's Blue Peter's bad boy, Richard Bacon. And in typical fashion he turns up at the theatre having been out all night celebrating his imminent 40th birthday. Where does he get his energy from?... oh right. Find out about how he once cried salty tears on to Mansfield McDonald's salty gherkins, how he became Top Of The Pop's most notorious ever presenter by accidentally calling some people fat, why he has been banned from the state opening of parliament, how he took a forgetful plate-spinner to Las Vegas, what he knows about the Tales of Robin Hood, what part of his anatomy (other than his mouth and nose) he can breathe out of, and why this gives him another kinship with Herring on top of his Dicky first name and food-based surname. Plus what he REALLY thinks of Una Stubbs (he thinks she's nice). And he gives himself something else to apologise for in a lifetime of apology. He's a very entertaining and lovely idiot, but as you'll see, it's all down to genetics. Hard to believe his one attempt at stand up-ended so badly.

Plus there's some more serious chat about whether the BBC can survive (don't worry, they're not watching) and some less serious chat about how much it would cost to employ a successful comedy actor as a Christmas elf (as well as the danger of working with Santas who've been in James Bond films).

His guest went to school with 'Pencils' Osborne, it's Hal Cruttenden. The pair discuss whether equality encompasses the middle-classes; gigs turning into armed sieges; being too star-struck to act with Anthony Hopkins; killing their wives for the insurance; having sex with ghosts (of course); and forming a Human Centipede with Eddie Izzard. Hal reveals for the first time a rare condition that he suffers from, though possibly just to give himself an alibi; and Rich reminisces about working in Ealing. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

      "description": "RHLSTP #94: David Mitchell - Bumming C3PO. Richard talks briefly to a semi-retired postman and considers bumping his guest to chat with him more, but instead introduces perhaps the perfect RHLSTP guest, David Mitchell. It's David's second time in the hot seat (though the chairs have got nicer since he was last here) and Richard is determined not to be as childish and rude to him as he was last time. But will he be able to keep a lid on the simmering mayonnaise vat of bitterness? Find out if David swears during sex, if he would allow himself to be raped by a ghost, why he's so obsessed with war that he's apparently wearing a poppy in January and if he enjoyed working the cloakroom for TFI Friday. There are also some more serious chats about the mindset of someone who paps a couple going for a walk with their baby and why there is so much antipathy towards Ben Elton. But it's possibly the funniest episode yet, with Mitchell, once again, giving possibly the definitive answers to some of the emergency questions. What a treat. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Richard successfully guesses the job of a bearded man in the audience before introducing the luckiest man on planet earth, who knows what it is like to have sex with a robot, Jack Whitehall. Seething with unconcealed jealousy at Whitehall's career and more pertinently his partner, Richard contrives several different ways to kill his guest and his own wife and child. Don't worry it's just a joke. It's almost certainly a joke. Find out the real reason Kate Middleton married Prince William, how Whitehall screwed up a gold-plated publicity opportunity, what it's like working with Shearsmith and Pemberton and rugby's homoerotic origins. A man exhausted from childcare interviews a man exhausted from jet lag about robot sex and the result is predictably indiscreet and hilarious. Richard also forgets Jack's name right at the end, but no one will notice that. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

His guest is the immaculately dressed and multi-talented Phill Jupitus, who isn't so good with names. They chat about giving U2's new song a minute of air play, whether stand-up is harder than acting, how the most difficult person to please is always your mum and why the BBC is doomed. Get the behind the scenes info on Buzzcocks' guests Jedward and Jamelia and witness an old emergency question morph into something new and even more disturbing.

Richard is unnecessarily unpleasant to someone in the audience (what's new?) before quickly bringing on a man with a drive that burgeons on insanity, but it's the good kind of insanity, Eddie Izzard. It's an unsurprisingly sprawling but incredible conversation that takes us through why God doesn't reveal himself, through the clumsy religious allegories of CS Lewis, through what kind of madness would make a man run 43 Marathons in 51 days, how to pronounce Calippo, how Eddie would have fared in the army, his political ambitions and philosophy, performing in languages that you were recently unable to speak, the short-sighted nature of the Ocean's Eleven franchise, the years of struggling to make it (with some great stories about his street theatre days) and why the world needs to come together and give everyone hope.

Richard is amazed how a joke on Twitter now pretty much always gets taken at face value by someone, even if it's in an open letter to an 8 month-old baby. His guest is Nicole Kidman impersonator and fantastically thoughtful yet and puerile stand-up Sarah Kendall, fresh from her nomination for the big comedy award at the Fringe. They discuss the horrors of child birth, the redundancy of the hand job, growing up in New Newcastle, how audiences can sometimes laugh in the wrong way, the plot holes in Back To The Future, loads of stuff about cocks and vaginas (obviously), the inevitability of nuclear destruction, plus some surprisingly serious bits about the nature of being a stand-up.

Richard makes more predictions of atrocities that will have occurred in the news on the week of release for this podcast and is impressed by the skills of another astrologer he has encountered. His guest is a man who knows how to clean a horse's anus, it's Lee Mack. Find out the truth behind his claims about cutting mustard, how to pick apricots, whose lawnmowers are in the Southport Lawnmower Museum and hear more musing over what is more morally acceptable, necrophilia or bestiality. Also can you run a marathon if one leg is shorter than the other, why aren't there more women on Would I Lie To You? and what it's like to work with the baby from The Railway Children.

Richard discusses some zombie based movie ideas he has had, before introducing the dry-witted and incredulous Diane Morgan who isn't quite sure what she's let herself in for. And it's a surreal, dream-like and occasionally mildly awkward chat about working with Ken Campbell; Richard's failure to see one of Diane's first performances; Bruce Willis on The One Show; Richard's ever-spiralling shoplifting problem; the slight let down of earliest memories (and what is the latest earliest memory that anyone has ever had?); and the importance of making it clear that you're not dating Joe Wilkinson.

Richard is worried that David Cameron has just made all his emergency questions irrelevant and amazed by the way the world has changed in the brief hiatus between series. And it's a PODCLASH as his first guest is the host of the brilliant Comedian's Comedian Podcast as well as Richard's backdoor neighbour, Stuart Goldsmith. With (pretty much) all new emergency questions to try out there's a lot to talk about including how to breathe fire, what Rumpel the Kangaroo King is really like, the BBC's plans to transport all children to the future. Also there's speculation on egg-gate and shit-by-the-gate-gate, as well as the opportunity to purchase a property with a direct view of Stuart Goldsmith's penis. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

It's the last show in Series 7 and there's an end of term atmosphere and a lot of good natured heckling from a slightly inebriated crowd. Richard's final guest is Peter Dickson impersonator and product of 1988, Joe Lycett. The podcast largely turns into the vehicle for a RHLSTP clips show as Joe quizzes Richard about his favourite and least favourite guests and what the future might hold for the valuable RHLSTP franchise. But there's also time to talk about identifying fish as they are slapped into your face, how much money Richard turned down to appear on TV with Katie Hopkins and the varying depravity of ex Blue Peter presenters.

Richard concludes the story of his disastrous romantic break with his wife and gives away an exclusive RHLSTP mug to one of the RHLSTP mugs. His guest is Britain's premiere John Peel/Oliver Hardy/Stewart Lee impressionist, Robin Ince. They discuss the autobiographies of Don Estelle and Syd Little, how Robin created The Office, a swearing Su Pollard, Iain Lee on a pink tricycle, the funniest serial killer and being the Giant Sand of comedy. Richard also quizzes about his decision to (at least temporarily) give up stand-up. It would be a shame. He's very funny. Having said that, he does seem to be in a very happy mood so why ruin that?

Giving away a prize to a lucky audience member, Rich reminisces about schoolday bags and realises how much work he has got to do to re-learn his 11 old stand-up shows for his insane attempt to do them all at the Leicester Square Theatre in August and September. His guest is a man who has done Chekov, Dickens and Celebrity Juice, Johnny Vegas. It's a truly fascinating discussion about the duality of the stand-up and where a Johnny ends and Michael Pennington begins. Michael discusses the lengths that Johnny would push him to and his total commitment to being a dog on stage, whether contentment and success mean the death of the character, how to make your own audience out of balloons, why he got the worst degree in his year at University and how he got his revenge. Plus how Monkey has clung to his back like a monkey, and the funniest sex show in history. It's really good. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

In this and the next podcast Richard is catching up with some of the stars of the failed 1990s comedy show, This Morning With Richard Not Judy. Next week it's one of the more minor figures, but this time we have the Curious Orange and the Small-Faced Boy, Paul Putner and Trevor Lock. The triumvirate remember the Edinburgh Fringe 1997, with the stage version of TMWRNJ which led to the TV series and how Trevor and Paul had Richard's penis waved in their face on a daily basis (in a play). They chat about how they were both witnesses and would-be saboteurs to the burgeoning romance between Richard and his one-time Shrine-based obsession, Julia Sawalha. We also chat about the special relationship that Trevor enjoyed with Nathalie and Paul's specialised expertise in performing as russet coloured disembodied heads. And find out what he thinks about the Annoying Orange. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

It's a change of pace from the usual podcasts, with some serious chats about medicine, quacks, how a dead cat became a doctor and the ways that data and statistics can be abused. But there's still time for Goldacre to raise questions about his sexuality, talk about his pop star mum and discuss his 'friend's' attempts at autofellatio. Can nutritionists work out your allergies by moving your limbs? Are Beroccas just homeopathy for sceptics? Is Lancaster a real place?

She has the requisite disdain for the emergency questions and Richard's foolishly competitive nature and there are fun chats about her attempts to make a porn film, how she faced up to and exposed some weirdo funeral crashers, who puts the bins out in the Coren Mitchell household and how different the Universe might have been if Richard had realised that there was a possible flirtation beneath their first ever meeting.

Al Murray had to drop out due to illness and so Rich was forced to find a new guest who could get to central London in an hour. And that guest was Michael Legge - no, not the one from the film Angela's Ashes or the blind or deaf Hereford-based massage therapist. The one from the Bollings and Nerrin Podcast. I can only apologise. But it turns out that the podcast might be even better with no preparation (ha, as if there's any anyway) and last second bookings cos Michael has funny stories about how he copes with people playing music on the bus, falling out with Robin Ince, Richard's inability to clap, and why he won't eat stuff that's come out of an animal. And there's more serious chat about the rise of the new-sexism in comedy and an almost entirely successful comedy of nostalgia about a show that nobody in the audience seems to have heard of. It gets awkward and weird, but they push through that and find some funny stuff again. He's no Al Murray and he might not even be the Michael Legge that you're thinking of, but he was the best we could do in the time available. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

You'll also find out what was with Prize Island, who won the World Cup of Chocolate (also what is the best crisps and chew) and Rich's performance on Pointless is roundly mocked. And in a segment that is bound to have a Sachsgate style repercussion on all internet programming, Richard Osman is very rude about Richard's mum, Barbara Herring, who has done nothing wrong, but point out a gross error made by the Egghead presenter (oh, sorry, he doesn't present that show).

Only time will tell if he is right again. His guest is the ubiquitous and claustrophobic Rebecca Front, a woman who has appeared in all manner of award-winning TV and Radio roles, but never, it seems, if Richard has been involved in the production too. You'll discover the confusion that can be caused by a mistimed fan shouting out one of your catchphrases, what Patrick Marber is really like to work with, how Morse will never be allowed to die and what happened when Lauren Bacall ate one of her husband's chips. Rich is embarrassed to ask his usual stupid, sexual questions to someone he considers to be purer than the Virgin Mary, especially when her 15 year-old son is in the audience. But he still asks them. Because he is trapped in a nightmare of his own making that he can't escape.

      "description": "RHLSTP #52: Sarah Millican - Why Won't You Tell Us Your Exact Address? Rich has some surprising and life-changing news to share, but that doesn't mean that gloves (and pants if it's cold enough) aren't off for the annual sparring match with TV's Sarah Millican. Who will win the flirtatious/offensive battle of wits this time? You'll find out why she appeared on TV without her underwear, why she kept her first husband's name, and be asked to consider whether she was unreasonable when she refused to tell a journalist her exact address. And would her DVDs sell better if she included a free sample of her own excrement? But you will learn more about Rich than his interviewee this week, because he was a bit tired and unable to control his mouth or brain. What does he have for breakfast on tour? Who was right and who was wrong during Cornetto-gate? Is money real or a meaningless abstract? And what happens if he ceases to be before he sees his own sexcrement? SUPPORT THE SHOW!

But he will soon forget his woes when he chats to the great-grandaughter of music writer Rosa Newmarch (and you never know who her great-grandfather might have been), Sara Pascoe. In what is one of Rich's favourite ever RHLSTPs the chat encompasses whether a vegan can eat a ham hand, how a six foot tall penis man would cope with his terrible life, what it's like to be part of a younger generation of comedians who are about to storm the comedy citadel and claim their rightful crown, and why there should be more women on Would I Lie To You?. Sara and Richard chat about how they fell in love (with other people) as their significant others possibly get together in the darkness of the auditorium. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Rich is still alive and kicking (and dancing) only a day after completing a Half Marathon in record breaking time (though to be fair he had a ringer to do it for him) and he's disappointed in the movie 'The Wolf of Wall Street' for all kinds of reasons. But he has a very special guest to help him celebrate his half century of RHLSTPs, it's the go-to guy if you want someone to play a small toy figure, Steve Coogan. A-ha! (Steve loves it when people do that). They chat about getting laughs at the Leveson Enquiry, why so many people that Steve has done impressions of have ended up in gaol, Stewart Lee's Partridge-inspiring encounter with a superfan and why 'Around the World in 80 Days' really needed more martial arts in it. And finally we're going to find out who created Alan Partridge. Will Steve pay Richard the 250,000 he demands in royalties? No he won't. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

His guest this week is the Rod Hull faced comedian James Acaster. You will find out what it's like to survive three car crashes and two train derailments, how much you could expect to earn selling slurpies in Kettering in the 1990s and what it is that draws the police to conspiracy theorists. Acaster also completely Mitchells the new emergency question. But has he ever seen a Bigfoot? You'll have to wait until the end of the podcast to find out. But it's unlikely I reckon.

Richard is still reeling from the lurgy he had in last week's show and his guest is also not very well, it's Mark Gatiss from off of League of Gentlemen and Fear of Fanny. Inevitably there is a lot of discussion about obscure 1970s TV and Tim from The Office being in Sherlock and you'll find out which Doctor Who monster Mark would most like to have sex with. But other questions include: How did Mark prepare for the role that made him famous, the voice of Greg Evigan on TMWRNJ? What characters DIDN'T make it into the League of Gentlemen? What is the biggest fossil that he has ever discovered? Should Rich buy a metal detector? And there's a terrifying real-life ghost story, and more on conspiracy theories.

His first guest comes from Sarnia - the no-nonsense, no-holds-barred Katherine Ryan.

      "description": "RHLSTP #42: Harry Shearer - Creative Differences. Richard has some news of an amazing time travelling finger and is clearly super excited to be meeting one of his all-time comedy heroes, Harry Shearer from off of This is Spinal Tap and The Simpsons. Rich was too scared to talk to him when he saw him improbably travelling on London's Tube, but hopefully he won't just sit quietly, staring at him and saying nothing this time. The pair discuss Harry's career which seems to break the space-time continuum as he's worked with such legends as Abbott and Costello, Jack Benny and Mel Blanc. Why does Derek Smalls wrap his courgette in tin foil and what's his affiliation with Shrewsbury Town? How much creative control do the actors on The Simpsons have over the characters they have helped create? Is stubbornness a pro or a con when trying to make it in show business? What is the Jerry Lewis film, \"The Day The Clown Cried\" really like? Will we hear from Simpsons character Hugh Jass? It's an amazing interview with a driven and hilarious genius man. And Harry Shearer is in it too. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Richard is still recovering from his important educational work on International Women's Day, but luckily he isn't going to be taxed by having to speak very much, because his guest is the loquacious and unsinkable Danny Baker. In a show overflowing with content you will find out, amongst much else, about a laserdisc signed by David Bowie, how Danny's amazing dad took umbrage with Harry Enfield, where talcum powder comes from, how to go to Hawaii with no money in the bank and how surviving cancer taught Danny nothing. Is Baker responsible for Bob Marley's demise? Is having no ambition or plan the key to showbiz success? Can you do a consumer affairs programme if you have sympathy with the villains? Is there any point in me trying to list all the stuff that happened? Baker is an amazing force of nature. This one could have gone on for days. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Richard chats with his audience and manages to secure himself a TV writing job, as well as marvel at his once IT heavy, bearded male audience being replaced by people who might actually have had sex. Don't worry, the nerds are still there and they're still the best! This week's guest is very tall and has never been told that before, it's sexually-charged comedian and actor Greg Davies. They converse about how W G Grace upstaged Greg's sister's wedding, how Guy Fawkes died and whether he'd welcome a time-travelling penis, how Greg embarrassed himself in front of Rik Mayall in a supermarket and bum-based encounters with doctors. It's raucous and very funny. This is one that might be worth paying the £3.50 to see on video. Not only does Greg have some amazing facial reactions, but Richard carries out one of the dirtybritcom confession fantasies on him. It's very, very sexy. SUPPORT THE SHOW!

Robert Llewellyn from Red Dwarf and Carpool is the charming and engaging guest. They discuss how the right-on comedy troupe 'The Joeys' got their name, science fiction in which the future is better than the present, a slightly disturbing use of time travelling genitalia, a near fatal car crash, the weirdness of being recognised from behind and how to escape from prison with a piss-drenched shirt.

The pair discuss big foot-based anal sex, the disappointing lack of shenanigans in the bar at the 1997 reboot of Blockbusters, setting up Jack Bauer's Facebook page, penis-length anxiety, how Stephen accidentally ended up shooting a porn film, the Wookey Hole paper-mill, what it's like picking up Ricky Gervais' Bafta and the rigours of filming with Halle Berry. Tim from The Office might get a mention. Due to Richard getting a bit overtired and overexcitable it goes a bit weird towards the end, but Stephen has achieved a lot of success through the comedy of embarrassment, so it's nice for him to witness some at such close quarters. You are going to enjoy Richard trying to dig himself out the hole he creates and doesn't seem to want to escape. It's an awkward end to a fun series of which Richard is both proud and ashamed.

But he's got a blinding guest to cheer him up, a man who has appeared in the triumvirate of sci-fi classics, but that won't mean anything until he's learned to jaunt, Simon Pegg. They discuss what Tom Cruise is really like, the pressures of being a godfather to a superstar baby, playing pranks and throwing up on the set of Star Trek, what it's like working with your teenage film star crush, time-travel cock rings, Ben Dover's merchandise and Richard suggests a new sitcom which might provide an opening for the return of Spaced. It probably won't though. And Richard dares to ask Simon what he himself considers his worst film. There could be fireworks! SUPPORT THE SHOW!

      "description": "RHLSTP #31: Ross Noble - Trojan Badger. The company director with the sexiest voice in the world is in the front row and Richard is needlessly rude to his less sexy fans. His guest is one of the world's greatest improvisers, Ross Noble. Richard shows how hard interaction can be by failing to find anything funny to say about the rest of the front row. But luckily from there on in, he is not going to get a word in edgeways as Ross talks non-stop for approaching 100 minutes about TGI Friday's, what it's like to own a tank, convincing his daughter that he's a wizard, why you can't trust Twitter to provide medical advice, why he's more Geordie than Cheryl Cole and how difficult it is to peel potatoes when all your possessions have been destroyed. There are also pyres of burning animals and mad cow leather trousers and criticisms of a hopefully still living Bruce Forsyth. Can Ross get comedy gold where Richard failed by interrogating a child therapist in the front row or can it only end in disaster? Can the pair keep the podcast going forever? Is it still going on now? Will you ever be able to catch up? SUPPORT THE SHOW!
