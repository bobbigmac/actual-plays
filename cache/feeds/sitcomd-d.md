  "description": "Five longtime friends and Chicago improvisers combine the best parts of two disparate worlds: sitcoms and Dungeons & Dragons. Follow a halfling bard, a half-orc warrior, a druid bar owner, and an elven princess as they struggle to keep the lights on at their tavern and inn, Bottoms Up. Unlike most D&D podcasts, each episode is self-contained, so drop in wherever just like your favorite sitcoms! Starring Erin Keif, Waleed Mansour, Elizabeth Andrews, Sean Coyle, and Ben Briggs.",
