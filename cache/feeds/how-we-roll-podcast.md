The heroes face the sinister conspiracies of an ancient race of monsters hell-bent on taking back a world that was once theirs. Join the players Joe, Liisa, Kuran and Dave and our Keeper and writer of the campaign Scott Dorward, and we play through this exciting adventure! The Two-Headed Serpent is an action-packed, globe-spanning, and high-octane campaign set in the 1930s for Pulp Cthulhu. The heroes face the sinister conspiracies of an ancient race of monsters hell-bent on taking back a world that was once theirs. Working for Caduceus, a medical aid organization, the heroes will loot a lost temple in the forests of Bolivia, go head-to-head with the Mafia in New York City, face a deadly epidemic in the jungles of North Borneo, uncover the workings of a strange cult in dust-bowl-era Oklahoma, infiltrate enemy territory inside an awakening volcano in Iceland, face the horrors of hideous medical experiments in the Congo, race to control an ancient and powerful artifact on the streets of Calcutta, and ultimately travel to a lost continent for a desperate battle to save humanity from enslavement or annihilation!

This has meant lots of frantic cleaning, tidying, talking to estate agents and lots of other not so fun things, which has led to me not finishing the the editing and production of this week’s episode. Luckily, a great friend of the show, Paul from Swordnut radio, stepped in and offered a solution. He suggested that we rerelease a recording he and I made a few month ago, for swordnut radio in which we recorded a discussion about horror gaming, suspense and how to combine them.

      "description": "Tonight we have a very special release for you. A few months ago I was approached by Kuran and Aaron who asked me if I’d be interested in learning more about Spencer Randell’s backstory. If you don’t already know, Spencer Randell is an alcoholic Private investigator with a troubled past who appeared on the very first HWR show back in 2015. He has survived everything the mythos has had to offer, from ghosts, to witches, deepones to Dagon himself, although he did almost lose his life to an irate hobo hiding in a basement. Spencer Randall is one of How We Roll Podcasts’s most beloved characters, and I was certainly keen on hearing more about his past but when I agreed all I was expecting was a few notes to add to the website...so when Kuran messaged me last week to tell me that after many months their project was finished, I was very excited but I did not expect to receive this. What you are about to listen to is the work of very many hours of writing, recording and experimentation by Kuran and Aaron along with a few of Kuran’s friends namely Ben, Sandra and Tom.
