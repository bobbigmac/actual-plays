  "description": "Comedians Tom Davis (The Wolf) and Romesh Ranganathan (The Owl) shoot the breeze for an hour a week because they couldn’t work out a format. They also take on listener problems if they remember to ask for them before they record. Not enough podcasts are just people talking with no real purpose. We’ve come to change all that. It’s a huge waste of time, but an entertaining one. Contains swearing because it’s really cool. \"As shooting the breeze goes, Tom and Romesh are as good as it gets\" - Evening Standard For questions or comments please email us at wolfowlpod@gmail.com - we’d love to hear from you.
