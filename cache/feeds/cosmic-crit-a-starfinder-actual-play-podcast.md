Listen to the shenanigans as a seasoned GM, a couple of noobs, and some RPG veterans explore the galaxy and fight monsters on behalf of the Starfinder Society. It's a little roleplay, a lot of natural 20s (we hope), and plenty of fun.",

      "description": "In our inaugural episode, we meet each of the playing characters as they cross paths in the seedy \"HUD Bar\" deep in Absalom Station in the Starfinder universe. Rami, Alyndra, ANDIS, Edrass, and Gnak each have their (relatively) innocuous reasons for entering the bar. But an encounter with a cadre of gang members adorned with a red fist symbol incites a brawl. Emerging bruised and beaten, our heroes barely get out alive. To make matters worse, Alyndra has a spooky experience ... but what does it mean?!",

Some of us are just starting out with tabletop RPGs, while others have enjoyed them for more than a decade. But we're all big science fiction / fantasy fans, and we're incredibly excited to try out Starfinder! We are starting with the first book of the Dead Suns Adventure Path, Incident at Absalom Station. But we'll throw in a hefty dose of homebrew and original character work along the way. Join us as we learn the rules of the game and explore the cosmos in Cosmic Crit. If you want to know more about us, you can also check out the Meet the Players page on our website.",
