  "description": "Six DMs return to the mists to run a completely Rules-As-Written Curse of Strahd campaign. Our core question: what happens when, rather than luring in a party of heroes or adventurers, the mists of Barovia claim a group of cowardly, cynical, selfish, and/or traumatized individuals who fall—not leap—into adventure? Join Jack, Kaiya, Linus, Tsarina, Twi and their DM DragnaCarta (creator of the popular Curse of Strahd: Reloaded guides) to follow the story of a group of ordinary people thrust headfirst into danger.",

      "description": "On this week's Adventuring Interviews, host Aerthrandir Aereal - who is definitely in his own right mind and not under any mind-affecting compulsions at all - chats with the Lord of Barovia himself. [Originally debuted during After Dark episode #6, on 26 February 2022.] Thank you so much for listening to Curse of Strahd: Twice Bitten! This is the last regular update for the series, although there may be special one-off bonus episodes in the future.",
