And there's a clash of the BBC documentarians as Kayvan unleashes the full force of his uncanny Louis Theroux impression and Adam does his best to respond with Adam Curtis. Recorded face to facejacker (oh dear) in London on 21st June, 2021. Thanks to Séamus Murphy-Mitchell for his work on this episode.

This is an edited version of a conversation that took place in front of a live audience at London's Royal Festival Hall on 25th September, 2019. I was there to interview Louis about his book, Gotta Get Theroux This, and as well as serious subjects like eating disorders and the abuses perpetrated by Michael Jackson, we covered lighter topics like the strange rumours about Louis circulated by the late sinister PR guru Max Clifford. We also covered Theroux memes, Theroux tattoos, the secrets of Theroux's interviewing technique, and my concerns with how Louis described the teenage me in his book.

      "description": "Adam talks with British poet, writer and musician Benjamin Zephaniah. PLEASE BE AWARE: During the first 10 minutes of our conversation Benjamin told me about some relatives suffering with the effects of COVID and included some details that may be upsetting to hear for people who have lost loved ones to the disease. So if you're worried, skip past those first ten minutes and you should be OK. It's not all pandemic chat though - mainly Benjamin describes fascinatingly how managed to make the transition from angry young criminal to internationally celebrated writer.

This predictive data is some instances then traded to other companies and organisations seeking to gain a financial or a political advantage by knowing how customers, or voters, might behave.

      "description": "Adam talks with Sara Pascoe and Richard Ayoade, (two British comedians who have also read and written, more than one book) about J.D. Salinger's classic 1951 novel 'The Catcher in the Rye'. SYNOPSIS: The story begins with 17 year old Holden Caulfield recuperating following a breakdown. The rest of the book is an account from Holden's point of view, of the events that lead to that breakdown, which took place the previous Winter in the days following his expulsion from Pencey Prep, a private school. Holden's roommate is a meathead called Stradlater who has sexy plans for Jean Gallagher, a childhood friend of Holdens who he feels protective of. A a fight ensues after which Holden spends two days killing time in New York before he has to face his parents and inform them of his expulsion. We learn that things have been difficult for Holden since the death of his younger brother Allie when Holden was 13. From time to time Holden dwells on the memory of Allie's old baseball glove on which his little brother had written poems to read during boring baseball games. Now Holden entertains hopes of moving in with his older brother DB, a WWII vet who has become a successful screenwriter in Hollywood. During his visit to New York, a lonely Holden visits a jazz club and spends much of his remaining cash buying drinks for three older women, after which he arranges an abortive liaison with Sunny, a teenage prostitute and falls foul of her thuggish pimp Maurice. Later Holden arranges a meeting with an old girlfriend, Sally Hayes, and is briefly looked after by a well meaning teacher Mr Antolini. But Mr Antolini's affections are interpreted as predatory by Holden who ends up, distraught and emotional, creeping into his parents house to see the only person in the world he feels he can really talk to - his little sister Phoebe.

There's also some discussion of dentistry and thigh vaginas. Nina is the author of 'Love Nina- Dispatches From Family Life' (2013), a collection of letters that she wrote to her sister Vicky in the 80s while working in North London as a nanny to the children of Mary-Kay Wilmers, who was the editor of the London Review of Books. 'Man At The Helm' (2014), is the first in a series of comic novels about Nina's fictional alter ego Lizzie Vogel, in which the young Lizzie and her siblings trying to find a suitable man for their wayward Mum. 'Paradise Lodge' (2016) finds the teenaged Lizzie working at a care home for the elderly. The latest in the Lizzie Vogel series is called 'Reasons To Be Cheerful' (2019) and this time the story takes place in the early 80s as Lizzie finds work as a dental assistant, a job that Nina herself did for several years as a young woman.

There was a problem with one of the mics on this episode hence roomy sound from back up recording. Apologies for any emotional scarring this may cause. Hello. Adam here with a few notes and links related to this episode for you. My rambly conversation with Charlie was recorded in March of 2018, in the west London house where he lives with his wife Connie and their two young children. Charlie started his media career writing about video games in the 90s and we began by reminiscing about our childhood fascination with those blocky virtual worlds. We also talked about Nathan Barley (Channel 4, 2005), Black Mirror (Channel 4, Netflix, 2011 - present), how comedic fury can be taken at face value, smoking, defecating, and how we would cope if we were on reality TV or facing armageddon and didn’t have Bear Grylls to advise us. Charlie also does a very good impression of comedian Jimmy Carr’s laugh. Thanks to Séamus Murphy-Mitchell for production support.

Matthew and Eleanor now work on solo projects but haven’t officially laid the The Fiery Furnaces to rest. My conversation with Eleanor was recorded in February 2016 and we talked about some of her favourite albums, her working relationship with her brother, whether or not fans should be interested in the private lives of the artists they admire, and her lyrics. Eleanor also performed a version of one of her songs exclusively for the podcast. And in my outro waffle I bollock on about a couple of music documentaries I enjoyed this week.

      "description": "Adam talks with British comedian Bob Mortimer. Hi. Adam Buxton here with some notes about Bob and this episode. For nearly 30 years Bob and his comedy partner Jim Moir (aka Vic Reeves) have stuck doggedly to what makes them laugh whether mainstream audiences get it or not, with shows like ‘The Smell Of Reeves & Mortimer’, ‘Bang Bang It’s Reeves & Mortimer’, ‘Catterick’, and ‘House Of Fools’ as well as the occasional reboots of the massively popular panel show ‘Shooting Stars’ and the show that introduced them to the world in 1990, ‘Big Night Out’. Consistently and inexhaustibly joyful, energetic and absurd, their parade of characters, silly voices, home made props and a sensibility that is often close to avant garde performance art, has made them two of the best loved and most influential comedians the UK has ever produced. When not working with Jim, Bob enjoys watching football. He’s an avid supporter of Middlesbrough FC and is currently the co host along with comedy writer Andy Dawson of the vaguely football themed podcast, ‘Athletico Mince’. It’s up with the funniest stuff Bob’s ever done. My conversation with Bob, took place in the London office of his agent and for a while we had to battle with some quite loud talkers in the corridor outside doing agent business (I was too weedy to ask them to be quiet), but that calmed down after a little while and we rambled about getting older, the TV shows that Bob enjoys, his new fishing show with old friend and fellow comedian Paul Whitehouse, music, petty crime and now and then we looked back over a few Vic & Bob moments from the last 30 years. It was a fun conversation that often revealed a softer and more gentle side to Bob than people might expect. It’s a good bet that he would feel quite deeply nauseated by that last sentence and perhaps a few before too.

      "description": "Adam talks with British actor, writer, character comedian and improvisor Cariad Lloyd (Austentatious, Murder In Successville, Drunk History etc.) about birth, middle age, funny accents, growing up in a ‘cult’ and why talking about death on a podcast is more fun than it sounds. CARIAD NOTES Hello, Adam Buxton here. My conversation with Cariad was recorded in February 2017. Why the delay putting it out Buckles? Well, long term podcats will know that some of the conversations I record take a long time to emerge because of the slightly ad hoc way me, Séamus and my occasional edit helpers go about getting each episode ready and figuring out where they should sit in the running order. We’re trying to get more organised but from time to time guests do experience significant delays. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. When we recorded our conversation Cariad and I were both at pivotal moments in our lives. Cariad had just had a baby but her happiness at the new arrival was mixed with sadness that her father, who died suddenly when she was just 15, was not around to see his grandchild. We spoke about that and had a fun chat about mortality in general. As for me, I had just attended the NME Awards which made me feel very old for various reasons. Regular listeners will have heard me moaning about this before and Cariad was not spared… Thanks to Séamus Murphy-Mitchell for production support and Jack Bushell for additional editing.

As I write these notes myself I thought I may as well start doing it in the first person rather than pretend I have someone to do it for me. It’s more or less a transcript of my spoken introduction, but here it is for your reference pleasure. Podcast number 72 features a conversation with an important figure in my life, British born producer and director Fenton Bailey who, along with his partner Randy Barbato, set up the production company World Of Wonder. In the early 90s I would stay up late and watch 'Manhattan Cable'. It was one of a number of World Of Wonder programmes that showcased and celebrated marginal culture, often with a trashy or camp aesthetic although from time to time they also produced shows like 'LA Stories' and Jon Ronson’s series 'The Secret Rulers Of The World' that had a more serious journalistic edge. In an effort to tap into British homemade video culture Channel 4 commissioned World Of Wonder to make a show called ‘Takeover TV’ in 1995. I sent in some videos I’d made while at art school and ended up presenting several episodes. By that time Joe Cornish was also involved and we went on the make ‘The Adam & Joe Show’ for Channel 4 between 1997 and 2001, with much of it shot and edited in World Of Wonder’s office opposite Brixton tube in South London. Although the bulk of World of Wonder’s output, which currently includes the phenomenally successful ‘Rupaul’s Drag Race’, is overseen from their offices in Los Angeles, Fenton and Randy met in New York in the early 80s. It was in NY that they formed their electronic dance duo, The Fabulous Pop Tarts, and in the course of gigging around New York’s clubs they met not only drag artist and musician RuPaul but the so called Club Kids, a group of outrageous party scenesters whose number included Michael Alig. Fenton & Randy had already begun filming the antics of the Club Kids when Michael Alig and his roommate Robert Riggs murdered fellow Club Kid Angel Melendez. The story formed the basis of World of Wonder’s 1998 documentary ‘Party Monster - The Shockumentary’, and was further adapted as a 2003 feature film ‘Party Monster’ starring Macaulay Culkin and Seth Green. My conversation with Fenton took place in November 2017 at World Of Wonder’s LA offices. Thanks to Séamus Murphy-Mitchell for production support.

      "description": "Adam talks with British comedian, actor and writer Jayde Adams. JAYDEFAX As you’ll hear Jayde began her performing career on a sad note following the death of her older sister Jenna in 2011. That encouraged Jayde to leave her native Bristol and start doing comedy, often in London drag clubs like Sink The Pink, Jonny Woo’s Unroyal Variety, The Glory and The Vauxhall Tavern. Just three years later she won the 2014 Funny Women Award and in 2016 was a nominee at the Edinburgh Comedy Awards. She’s in Edinburgh again this year with her third show, an homage to Bette Midler entitled 'The Divine Ms Jayde’ (Pleasance Courtyard, 9.30pm, August). Adam & Jayde recorded their conversation in February 2018. WARNING! Includes frank discussions of a sexual nature and there’s also some dead rat chat.

      "description": "Adam travels to Paris to meet his old friend, British director Garth Jennings. After a brief catch up, Garth introduces Adam to his old friend, and fellow Paris dweller, Wes Anderson of Texas, USA. The conversation was recorded in early March 2018 shortly before the release of Anderson’s 9th feature, and 2nd foray into stop motion (after Fantastic Mr Fox) Isle Of Dogs. Set in a dystopian near-future Japan, Isle Of Dogs follows a young boy who goes in search of his dog after the whole species is banished to an island due to an illness outbreak. Adam, Garth and Wes enjoy a rambly chat about the production of Isle of Dogs and stop motion in general, David Bowie (of course), Mary Poppins, cantankerous cast members and other important odds and sods.
