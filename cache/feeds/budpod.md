      "description": "Phil returns to the BudPod house, joining Pierre for a lively episode featuring special guests Sara Cox and Clare Hamilton — the brilliant duo behind the Teen Commandments podcast. The gang dives into tales of their wildly different teenage years, the perils of swearing on live radio, and battle it off in a classic tat whisper! Head over to the BudPod Patreon to listen to the FULL show! Check out Sara and Clare's 'The Teen Commandments' here ! Best friends Sara Cox and Clare Hamilton survived their chaotic teenage years together. Now they're back in the trenches with five teens between them - but armed with laughs, survival tactics and the kind of wisdom that only comes from being former rule-breakers themselves. Each week they’ll reminisce and commiserate as they attempt to make sense of the often mind-boggling behaviour of modern teens…because the best teen advice comes from those who know every trick in the book. Recorded at the Playhouse Theatre, Sheffield as part of the Crossed Wires Podcast Festival. 5.7.25. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

But one thing stuck, a sticky mess, They couldn't stop talkin' 'bout the... well, you know the rest. [Chorus] \"De-colon-isation,\" they'd say, \"We gotta stop this poo-talkin' way.\" Sippin' Lucky Kentucky, cool and slow, \"KOJI!\" they'd shout, \"Keep Jackin' It, yo!\" [verse 2] They tried to talk 'bout love and life, But somethin' deep, a poo-filled strife, Would pull them back, their minds would stray, To the brown stuff, they couldn't stay away. [Chorus] \"De-colon-isation,\" they'd say, \"We gotta stop this poo-talkin' way.\" Sippin' Lucky Kentucky, cool and slow, \"KOJI!\" they'd shout, \"Keep Jackin' It, yo!\" [verse 3] But listen close, you'll hear the truth, Their hearts are pure, their words are smooth. They're just two guys, tryin' to be free, From the poo-talkin' tyranny. [outro] So raise a glass, to Phil and Pierre, For their de-colon-isation, year after year. May they find peace, from the poo they fear, And keep on jacking it', for another year. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",
