      "description": "The battlefield is only getting uglier as medium-sized serpent-dragons of the black chromatic variety start tunneling under the battlefield Tremors-style and swallowing horses. Orcs and kobolds pile onto our heroes in layer after layer. The gigantic dragon Storndor lands, and whoops, his armor class is higher than 20. Twee's quest to open a portal is being carefully timed, but will it even out as the battle gets bloodier? Will the crew resort to desperate measures? We welcome back Chris Tallman as Typha, and a special thanks to engineer Sam for turning the volume way down on the dragon roars.",
