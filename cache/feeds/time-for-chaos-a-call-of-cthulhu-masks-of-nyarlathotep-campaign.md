Often considered the greatest role-playing game campaign ever written, Masks of Nyarlathotep stretches the boundaries of horror driving both characters and players insane since its publication in 1984. Time For Chaos is a playthrough of Masks of Nyarlathotep for the 7th Edition Call of Cthulhu role-playing game system by Chaosium. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",
