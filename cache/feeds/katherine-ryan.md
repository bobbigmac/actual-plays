Serving fashion and peak teenage angst, she gave us modern-day Tia from Uncle Buck (a movie made a cool 20 years before her birth, which just goes to show - some things never change). We are OBSESSED with Violet, the most popular girl in the Ryan-Kootstra household. She is the moment. She is livid. She is disgusted that we exist. Katherine's mother, Julie is also in town to collect her birthday gift from the ONLY cosmetic surgeon Katherine would trust in the UK to do a facelift. Also, 41 year old Anne Hathaway sparks confusion as she takes on the role of a 40 year old mother of a teenager in her newest film.
