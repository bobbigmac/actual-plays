No lights glow in the windows and no signs of celebration mark the coming of Alf Gappen’s Day. Yet in the stillness, a single sleeping child hums a quiet tune that carries impossibly far across the snow. Three spirits hear it and cross the tundra to a place stripped of joy, determined to bring warmth and wonder.

The streets lie quiet, sun-bleached and cracked, littered with the remnants of shops and abandoned homes. Across the train tracks, half-buried in sand and shadow, a mine shaft waits, its mouth dark and inviting. Fortune is found only by those desperate enough to follow it into the unknown.

Our Patreon has so much stuff on it it's like, logistically annoying to even write them all out, and you can get it all immediately upon subscribing. Ame's witch class, Suvi's Wizard of the Citadel subsclass, Eursulon's Oath of Freedom, multiple one-off adventures set in Umora, soundtrack singles from the show, and just so much more, really. Not to mention early merch drops or discounts which miiiiiight become very useful very soon if you catch my drift. Wanna subscribe for one month, get all the cool stuff and then dip out? You can literally do that. That is something you can literally do. It's chilly out there in the woods. Come sit by the Fireside with us. [PATS LOG]",

If there is a town, a bag, the throat of the ravening beast, the back room of a humble butcher's shop, your end at the bottom of the mighty Lydwyn. Towns are like Empires, they are made of people and promises. Roads are like graves, they are made of dirt and the space you fill. And along the road, like pallbearers: wild, wild things.

There is an idea, buried deep within every human being, that says \"Anywhere I can go, I should go.\" And so we climb mountains, we sail oceans, we plunge into pitch black caverns, every time with the confidence and entitlement that comes from the idea that we are fundamentally welcome in the world. That idea is wrong. There are some places. There are some woods. There are some glades. And in these places, we are very much unwelcome. Happy Spooky season, kids. Heads up, there's more gore than usual in this one. Starring Lou Wilson, Aabria Iyengar, Erika Ishii, and Brennan Lee Mulligan Produced by Taylor Moore Edited and Designed by Brian Flaherty of Many Sided Media . For more of his award-winning sound design, check out My First Dungeon and Bitcherton wherever you get your podcasts. And featuring an original score and live saxophone performance from Joseph David Spence , with additional vocals by Maddi Albregts, Coryn May, and Joseph David Spence",

      "description": "Wars and rumors of wars. Thrilling new weapons to titillate the thanatos urge of even the most inured imperial citizen. Heroes-to-be assemble and depart. While the Citadel mobilizes for battle, the gang hits the books. Names ancient and new swim to the sun dappled surface of understanding, the grand picture ever clearer. Careful though: the books do, occasionally, hit back. Worlds Beyond Number is: Brennan Lee Mulligan Erika Ishii Aabria Iyengar Lou Wilson and is produced, designed, and scored by Taylor Moore at Fortunate Horse with exquisite design and editing help from Jared Olson This episode featured additional music (the mellow groove in Sunder's salon) by Will Savino . Catch his fantastic tabletop scoring at Band Camp , Youtube , Spotify . Transcript of this episode coming soon! You can find transcripts of all our episodes here, for free, on our Patreon.

      "description": "Names are great. They let people know what to call things. You can read them, write them, put them on a list. If you know someone's name you can send them things, invite them places, say it quietly, in wonder or fear. A name can stick in your mouth like butter or blood. You can make one up, get a new name, do whatever you want. No downsides. None.
