      "description": "There have been several emails asking for live play. So, here is a sandboxed Umerican adventure as the Secret Door Games Tutu Parlor Players figure out the additional rules set for Dungeon Crawl Classis. The adventurers are John as Cheese Whiz III; Greg as Solo; Jess as Coughing Hannibal; Jason as Henry Mortimer. Having just come through the funnel Damn Tasty, the PCs now have a cargo truck full of Go! Afterlife Bars. Matter of fact, they have 20,706 Go! Bars. Solo, our petrol head has souped up the cargo truck with his undue knowledge of engines and scrap. With two scavengers on the team, there is always something to help fix things or build things. Cheese Whiz III and Coughing Hannibal are always looking around for items to pilfer. And Henry, well, he is our fossorian. Call him a varmint and he may just lick you hand. And then again, maybe not. Enjoy this live play as we find out where the cargo truck loaded with Go! Afterlife Bars takes us. Visit City of Iow and enjoy some time at Sunken Flats Carnival. Thanks for listening.",

I am testing out a podcast audio board in hopes to have some interviews and possible live play recording. Having not used a mixer board before, I have some curves to maneuver.

With months of trying to sift through an abundance of material for DCC RPG and having a heck of a time trying to decide what this episode was going to be, I went to social media and asked the question of what it is that you, the listener would like to hear. Well, here it is...the 3rd party publisher I came to know first. Hey, there are many 3rd party publishers out there for DCC RPG and they are all good. What I chose for this episode was the first 3rd party publisher that I became familiar with after being introduced to Goodman Games publications. Sit back and enjoy the long awaited episode.
