  "description": "Tabletop Tiddies began in 2020, with our Dungeons and Dragons Actual Play Stream and Podcast, The Wildwell Trials . For our inaugural season, we took a dive into Fearfort, a world completely homebrewed by our Dungeon Goddess, Charlene Bayer. Three years later, we now have produced three seasons of Dungeons and Dragons live streamed shows, two seasons of Tiddies By Night, our Vampire the Masquerade Chronicle, and a handful of one shots, mini series, and Patreon Exclusive shows. Our shows have featured guests such as Josephine McAdam, B.Dave Walters, and Noura Ibrahim, and we can’t wait to have more wonderful guests at our table. The Tiddies have been active members in the tabletop gaming community for years, taking part in many streams, podcasts, and charity events. Be sure to follow Tabletop Tiddies and each of us on social media to stay updated!",

ABOUT WAVAW WAVAW Rape Crisis Centre provides free-of-charge, gender-affirming support services to survivors of sexualized violence with shared experiences of gendered oppression including cis and trans women and trans, non-binary and Two Spirit survivors. Support services include victim services, hospital, court, and police accompaniments, and individual and group counselling. Gender-based violence is systemic, and our work goes beyond service provision to advocating for and enacting change within our society to create safer communities. Despite being BC's largest sexual assault centre, and managing a caseload of more than 300 survivors at any given time, the waitlist to access free-of-charge counselling at WAVAW is almost 2 years long.
