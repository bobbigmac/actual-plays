Links: The title of this episode is inspired by a TTRPG created by friend of the show Seamus Conneelly (of the wonderful Cannibal Halfling Games), wherein your Fleet is desperately trying to outrun those who pursue them while their resources dwindle. It has always stuck with me because not only is it a cool name, it took me ages to realise that he meant \"Stern\" as in the direction on a ship, as opposed to the the attitude. Anyway, buy it here: https://seamus-conneely.itch.io/a-stern-chase-is-a-long-chase and also check out Cannibal Halfling Games at https://cannibalhalflinggaming.com/ for all your TTRPG blogging needs!
