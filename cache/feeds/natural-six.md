      "description": "Want to know how the sausage was made? Well, in this week’s episode of Action Surge, we reveal far too much. Including how Doug removed and ate the filling from a sausage roll, then folded the pastry back together and put it back in the bag. Frankly, abhorrent. Once we have accepted that Doug might be a killer, it is back to D&D. We talk about those little shards of broken gem, and how utterly shocked Harry was when we casually ignored every piece of breadcrumbing he tried to lay down. We reflect on how right it felt for Dolly, Raidion, and Elowen to hang back, making space for some genuinely perfect story moments and very good dice rolls. I might have drugged a guy, but it was extremely cool. We also discuss how much we love piling on Ben whenever he does something silly, and look at what happened this time. We think about Dolly and her plans for the future, how Aoife imagines all of this playing out, and why we are absolutely convinced it is all going to be incredibly important. Finally, we discuss how deeply unfair it is for Alex to claim he is not patient when, in reality, he is just very excitable, and we love him for it. --- Support us on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/naturalsix Join our Discord! https://discord.gg/HNV56DADnJ Follow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/naturalsix Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/natural_six Follow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@natural.six Love lore?

      "description": "There are times when victory tastes sweet, when flowers bloom, and cheers swell, and the world feels ready to celebrate. But even triumph can feel heavy when the noise grows too loud and when the eyes that follow expect too much. Sometimes the only way to breathe is to slip away and wander the quieter corners of a city that no longer remembers how to shine. For in the places where stories were once told freely, silence has begun to settle. Words falter, inspiration dries, and even the brightest spirits dim beneath an unseen weight. Joy has grown thin, stretched too tight, tugged away by something that feeds on the spark that keeps a city alive. And as laughter fades and passion drains, the search for answers becomes a race against the rising quiet. And in the hush of a hidden room, secrets cling to silvered glass, and as the truth gathers its shape, it’s the final step that brings you face-to-face with far more than your reflection. ---- Support us on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/naturalsix Join our Discord! https://discord.gg/HNV56DADnJ Follow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/naturalsix Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/natural_six Follow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@natural.six Love lore?

      "description": "Aoife went out for milk. We are sure she will come back for us eventually, but while we wait for her return and her love, let’s talk about everything that happened in episode 47, and a whole bunch of other stuff, too. This episode really was all about the race, and we absolutely have to give Harry his flowers for everything he put together and how perfectly it came together in the end. A special mention also goes to Harry’s wife for the beautiful arts and crafts diorama that brought the whole thing to life. We take a deep dive into the mechanics for each district, the stats of the ships and crews, and how each one felt genuinely unique. Harry even designed his own version of a Mario Kart blue shell for the finale (thanks for that). We talk about the gorgeous boat Mark from Crafted Campaigns sent over for the race, how we broke it, how we broke it some more, and how we nearly didn’t have any other minis because the Uber driver thought we might be shipping drugs. We also spent some time talking about Raidion, the Thornbears, and how fun it might be to start exploring that thread further. Plus, we all agree that Kelnys is totally proficient with panpipes, and that Aoife was rolling so badly this episode that she more or less went through the full stages of grief. --- Support us on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/naturalsix Join our Discord! https://discord.gg/HNV56DADnJ Follow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/naturalsix Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/natural_six Follow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@natural.six Love lore?

      "description": "There are moments when spirits sink low, and the world needs something bold enough to send a ripple running through the darkness. Hope always has a way of coming back to the surface, rising on a swell of laughter, competition, and the kind of enthusiasm that refuses to stay anchored for long. Sometimes all it takes is a little mischief to keep the current moving. And when the race begins? Well, decorum might take a holiday, rules might drift conveniently out of sight, and the idea of always coming first becomes a touch…shellfish. Tricks can set the tide turning, bold choices can leave the competition half-mast, and every stroke sends another wave of chaos across the bow. After all, when the spirits need lifting, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. But somewhere between the splashing, scheming, and spirited rowing, joy begins to crest again. Because sometimes, to stay afloat, you have to let go, lean in, and trust that even the choppier waters can carry you forward. And if you happen to ruffle a few feathers on the way to brighter shores? Well, that’s all part of the plan! ---- Support us on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/naturalsix Join our Discord! https://discord.gg/HNV56DADnJ Follow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/naturalsix Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/natural_six Follow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@natural.six Love lore?

      "description": "We like 'em cold, we like 'em hot. It's time for this week’s Action Surge! This week we talk about bad luck, poor rolls, and everyone’s note-taking abilities. Nobody will be surprised to learn that some people are better at this than others. Welcome to the Alex Jordan mind palace. We think everyone agrees that the Temple of the Once Wild was a pretty special place. We talk about Magnus, Harry’s inspiration behind him, and let’s be honest, we all agree that Magnus and Lovak would have got into a lot of trouble in the past. Good trouble. Well, bad good trouble. You know what we mean. From there, we turn our attention to letters, language, and Theolon, a god of two halves. Those letters might not be as unknown as they once were, and if you need a reminder of what they said, you can find them, and so much more, over on our Fandom. Don't forget to check it out! Harry talks about the challenges of balancing multiple character stories and arcs, and how he switches between them. Ben shares some insight into how he is playing Raidion right now, including the mashing and merging of character sheets. Finally, we look ahead to Harry’s next big action sequence, the upcoming boat race, and why action at the table does not always have to mean fighting and battles. Is this our Podracing moment?!

And when talk turns to chance, it becomes easy to wonder what might happen if you are willing to take the risk. Even if you only have a 10% chance of succeeding, sometimes it is more about the adventure you have along the way. Yet certainty can still feel fragile. A weight too heavy, whispers too sharp, and a hand that refuses to loosen its grip no matter the ask. Strength can feel simple until it is questioned, and harder still when you cannot tell who you need to defend it from. When the time comes, the world might demand a choice. And when life sets two paths in front of you, it can feel like a race to the top. In those moments when you are searching for joy, it’s a test of whether you have the strength to climb and the ability to hold on. And while the ride might be bumpy, the corners sharp, and sometimes even a little greasy underfoot, when you make it to the finish line, a little extra movement can go a long way. ---- Support us on Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/naturalsix Join our Discord! https://discord.gg/HNV56DADnJ Follow us on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/naturalsix Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/natural_six Follow us on TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@natural.six Love lore?

Not soldiers, not quite, but to move forward they must prove themselves, not through loyalty or words, but action. Competition has a way of sharpening things. Old rivalries resurface, tempers fray, and the line between friendly challenge and something more dangerous begins to blur. Out here, nothing stays simple for long. Yet the road does not belong only to conflict. There are moments of quiet, and of shared wonder. Under moonlight, dragons reflect something ancient and hopeful, reminding them what this fight might be for. Those you want to protect. Those who stand beside you. The answers you seek. Sometimes, the future doesn’t arrive with a roar, but with the sound of something beginning to break free. Want to know more?

      "description": "This might genuinely be some of the dumbest nonsense we have ever done. An avalanche, but backwards, improvised on the spot. Sure. Why not. We start this week’s Action Surge with a quick visit to the media pen, because it is all about those important post-race interviews. Eyes firmly on the prize as we reflect on what was, honestly, an incredibly fitting conclusion for a horrible, misshapen horse. This episode took a turn that absolutely nobody was ready for, but was it fun? Absolutely. Raidion walks away with some extra movement, and Aoife takes the opportunity to complain about her lack of cool stuff. Naturally, we also take this moment to remind her that she actually has plenty of cool stuff already. Reality is, we are not especially objective-driven, and we are not particularly loot-driven either, which says a lot about Harry as a DM. We talk about NPCs and the way they can act as a conduit for conversations that players need to have, but cannot always have directly with each other. They allow space for humour and lightness, but also for more serious moments when they are needed. We also dig further into that sword, what might have happened if the party had tried to take it, and how the group might start piecing together what it all means. Kelnys, in particular, seems very invested in figuring it out. We talk about accents and how Harry uses them to subtly guide us as players and characters in certain directions. Yes, there is absolutely something about posh accents that gets a rise out of us, and we spend some time unpacking the impressions they can give. And now, we are back in the big city, and it is time to start exploring. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

Even if you only have a 10% chance of succeeding, sometimes it is more about the adventure you have along the way. Yet certainty can still feel fragile. A weight too heavy, whispers too sharp, and a hand that refuses to loosen its grip no matter the ask. Strength can feel simple until it is questioned, and harder still when you cannot tell who you need to defend it from. When the time comes, the world might demand a choice. And when life sets two paths in front of you, it can feel like a race to the top. In those moments when you are searching for joy, it’s a test of whether you have the strength to climb and the ability to hold on. And while the ride might be bumpy, the corners sharp, and sometimes even a little greasy underfoot, when you make it to the finish line, a little extra movement can go a long way.

      "description": "Join Natural Six for a special two-shot adventure with Drakonym, a brand-new TTRPG coming soon from the team at Crossed Paths -- With rebellion spreading across the land, conscription is underway. One by one, hopefuls, outcasts, and stragglers are pulled towards recruitment, each chasing something different: answers, honour, redemption, or simply a way forward. And when you’re the last to arrive, and the last to rise, you may find yourself bound more by circumstance than certainty. Before war or glory, though, there’s food. Or at least the promise of it. From questionable rations to extremely specific tastes, it doesn’t take long to learn that a rebellion camp isn’t so different from any other school. Cliques form fast, tensions simmer, and even here, playground bullies still exist. Yet no amount of hunger or hostility can dull the moment between a dragon and its ward. Young or old, stubborn or curious, the bond is unbreakable. It isn’t about power, but companionship, or at least the promise of it. And sometimes, that’s all you need to begin. Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "An interesting episode of Action Surge this week. Mark at Crafted Campaigns made pretty much everyone hot, and once we recovered from the bi-panic he managed to induce, we had plenty to discuss. We start by talking about how this might not have been a deadly encounter, but that did not mean we could afford to take too many hits. And this time, I (the character, not the me) did not shrink away! We are still not sure if it was Alex or I, but someone woke up feeling ready for a fight, and ready to break the old hide-shoot-hide-shoot rhythm of a classic rogue. We also had minis. Yes, we know some people have been itching for action, and in this episode, we had more incredible minis from Mark at Crafted Campaigns. Harry also talks about the limits of his improv, which incidentally seems to be playing someone universally agreed to be incredibly fit. Also, he was apparently going to leave a note in someone’s bag. Do not be a coward, Harry. We discuss Spare the Dying and how that might have saved Torrian. We also talk about how Harry previously establishing death saves for certain characters might have helped him live to see another day. Either way, if we are trying to keep Elowen from spiralling, then killing her family is not exactly helpful. After all, who does she fight for if not her family? We also break down more information about her brothers and Elowen’s relationship with each of them. Look, rules are hard, and the application of rules is even harder. We love trying new things at the table, but sometimes, no matter how many times you read something, it is not until you try to use it that you realise how tricky it can be. Lucky for us, all of that is captured on camera. Are we flawless? Absolutely not. But we’re learning as we go, and not being scared to share it is part of our journey too. We will try again next time. We also talk about supporting each other and supporting our characters. How the DM chooses to pass that information along, how exciting it is to arrive in a new city, and what we might expect when we get there. Winter sports in Reliquiae? Yes, we discuss those too.

      "description": "Strength may hold you steady, but in the chaos of battle, when fear takes hold, even the surest hands can falter, and what once felt like control can begin to slip away. When reality feels like a nightmare, and dreams feel like the truth, trust begins to fracture beneath the weight of doubt, and when everything you love might slip away, whispers of power can be too sweet to resist. But between the safety of home and the road that still calls, sometimes strength isn’t found in the swing of a weapon, but in the act of letting go. Yet among it all, when armour can be traded for something far less guarded, there are still glimmers of what makes the fight worth enduring: a spark of laughter, a flush of colour, and the quiet reminder that charm can disarm just as easily as any blade. And when an impressive display turns every head, even those that hadn’t realised they were looking, it’s easy to forget that not every encounter requires a blade. Some of them might have you wanting to go a bit more slowly before deciding to yield. Natural Six are Harry McEntire, Doug Cockle, Ben Starr, Hollie Bennett, Alex Jordan, and Aoife Wilson.

      "description": "Before we can even begin doing what Action Surge is actually here for, which is reflecting on the previous episode, we somehow open the show with legs above the heart and a sexual intimidation roll-off. Naturally. How else were we meant to concentrate? We talk about how Harry tried to deliver story, lore, and information to the party without dumping it on the players. Despite the warmth and safety of a good, comfortable inn, Raidion's decision to stay sober for an entire session was a genuine moment of character growth. We also look at the role reversal in this episode. Kel really let his hair down, and we were all delighted. It has also been a while since we met any of the Grēnweard brothers, so Harry shares a bit more insight into the most bookish of them, Torrian, especially when compared to Eiddon. Realistically, not many people compare to Eiddon. And let us be honest, who among us does not have a crush on Dolly? Plus, it might actually be comforting for Elowen to hear news of her brother after everything she has been through. Naturally, we also talk about the hotties of Reliquiae so far. From Morgan, to Aska (who can absolutely make us feel special any time), to Medea (everyone has a type, we are not here to judge), and now Lovak. The group might have been a little starved for attention, and we're thrilled to hear that he knows what he's doing. Then there is the amulet. Raidion might not have been drinking, but he certainly didn't stay out of trouble. We chat about that moment, the beauty of detail-oriented Doug and Kelyn's, and how he loves encouraging little character beats to happen. Finally, we talk about death at the table and the important role it can play when it is used thoughtfully. Harry has never really hidden that he sometimes regrets not killing a brother or two back at Castle Grēnweard. And we also learn that the song From the Darkness Light does not actually have any lyrics, which is frankly devastating. We simply want to hear Harry sing. Oh, and the Reliquiae master document? It is currently sitting at 328 pages and still growing. Also, gag reflexes. For reasons. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

We talk about how Harry plays with fast travel, what we did and didn’t do, and how we choose to interact with the world around us. We chat about Dolly and how she sets the tone for the group, how Harry would always choose to save the penguins, and the difference between help and hope. The Newly Dead are, for now at least, no longer the enemy, and we get a peek behind the screen at who we could have met (hello, Twinkle), the changes to Lesser Restoration (and how that might have completely changed our plans), and how our group seems determined to hold themselves to some very weird standards.

      "description": "Hope moves in mysterious ways. It can be found deep within, bestowed upon you by chance, or something you simply search for in others. But with hope comes fear, the fear of failing, of carrying a burden you never asked for. And though so many seek it, hope can so easily be lost somewhere between the harshness of winter and the reality of war. Yet hope offers a chance to teach, a moment to heal, and an opportunity to break bread with others. Even when feelings are still too raw, too heavy, or sometimes just a little too salty to ignore, it can still be found by those willing to look for it. In a world where nightmares and anger threaten to throw you off balance, sometimes the only thing you can do is stand up, take a swing, and let it all out. Because while the road ahead might still feel heavy, there is strength in knowing you don’t have to walk it alone.

      "description": "We open with the important questions, like why Alex always walks in circles and how sock puppets somehow entered the chat. Do not worry, there are many voices of Doug Cockle to make up for it. It is the first time we have filmed for a whole weekend in a while, and Harry talks about how much he prepped, and how much we actually explored. For the first time ever, we have left without tying up all the loose ends. They can figure it out for themselves, right? We chat about the team finally getting a moment to breathe, how they interact when the pressure is off (spoilers, they drink), and, how much Harry hates fast travel. Dolly and Aoife both chose chaos this week, and we break down her decision to stab straight through the middle instead of, well, literally anything else. Honestly, she just wishes they had kept the receipt. We get intimate with I, and unpack exactly what Raidion saw with that Nat 20. There really are no secrets among friends. Then it is story time with Doug Cockle. We talk patience, lore, and the perfect sprinkle of flakey salt that made Kelnys’ moment shine. He is such a unifying force, and it felt so good to learn more about him. Finally, we talk about Raidion treating this episode like a bottomless brunch, and Alex treating us to the gun show. Because why not? Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

      "description": "As winter greets them with open arms, the air feels cold, clean, and gloriously alive. Now, as the world stretches wide once more, breath can turn to laughter instead of fear. Yet, while freedom might taste sweet, it can be a little unsteady, and the path ahead may yet prove far bumpier than expected, and not everyone is built for the ride. Still, laughter carries on the wind, and joy finds its place amidst the chaos, offering a chance to reflect on love, loss, and lives once lived. In a world full of promise and poor decisions, if you choose to dance to the beat of your own drum, you’d best be ready for the rhythm that follows. And as the fire crackles and the snow falls quietly, they learn that even in a world where everyone knows your name, even the Newly Dead can still get ghosted.

      "description": "In this instalment of action surge, we reflect on an episode that - despite being our shortest episode yet - was jam packed with story, character and with everyone needing to think on their feet. We talked about how discussions away from the table can result in further discussions at it, and how these moments offer characters the chance to change and grow. Ben revealed parts of Raidion’s story that many of the characters had not yet been party to regarding the family he remembers and the darkest corners of his past. Next we moved on to balancing mechanical efficiency and character authenticity, reflecting on what it’s like to play at a table where people don’t want to tell the story in simplest ways - Aoife giving insight into Dolly’s discomfort with her newly acquired drum. Then we moved on to the last half of the episode and the discovery of the way out of The Old Dark. Harry let us in on his thought process as he tried to balance creating atmosphere and handling seat-of-your-pants mechanics. We talked about responding to interesting ideas your players come up with, and trying to reward them for their ingenuity. It’s always about telling the story together. After a brief video game discussion detour, we moved on to what happens next. Could an alliance between the kobolds and The Children of the Midnight Moon benefit both parties? Do the Newly Dead need to start building bridges, or is it enough to keep burning them down? We’ll have to find out next time… Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

      "description": "Life is ever-moving, ever-changing. A weave of dreams and nightmares, the grotesque and the great. You might want to look cool, but it is not about how you appear. It is about what you live for and who you choose to fight for. A moment of rest can grant the gift of reunion, a chance to break bread and reflect on the paths that led here, and on stories shaped by fear, by loss, and by the desire to protect. Yet there is warmth in stories, in remembering who came before and in daring to paint the image of what comes next. While the paint of the past might still be wet, the colour of adventure is never finished. There is still so much to discover, if you can be strong enough to save those you love.

      "description": "This week’s Action Surge we start by talking about pace. Episode 39 opened with deep lore (some might call it an unskippable cut scene, others might call it a well-earned reward for surviving), before dropping us into a bit of a sandbox. Yes, even Harry had no idea what we’d do next, and yes, we still managed to surprise him. Not all of it was a delight. From there, it was colours, visions, and the question of what might have happened if Alex had actually rolled that six. And somehow, an NPC who somehow managed to survive at the end of last episode suddenly became more important than any of us, or Harry, ever planned. Kc’ahrl proved that when the average on 3d8 is twelve, sometimes you do not need to worry about morality at all. We also reflect on I’s unexpected promotion to de facto leader of the kobolds. Either way, a return to the Old Dark might have been exactly what the story needed. Finally, we touch upon what might happen when priorities do not line up, and why those differences might shape the party just as much as any battle on the table. Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "Colour blooms where endings meet beginnings, a brilliance that lingers long enough to change those who reach for it. Memories unfurl in shades of truth, painting the past in wounds not yet healed. Yet revelations can fracture what once felt certain, as truths and lies entwine so tightly they almost look the same. But while they lingered in shadow, the world above shifted, reshaped into something more dangerous than they left behind. Paths stretch forward, but none without cost, and none without consequence. Hope can be born from endings, if those left behind are willing to shape it. Yet even as new futures are spoken into being, discord stirs, and paths diverge. When one demands more than the others can give, which path will you walk? What do you do when there is still so much to be afraid of?

      "description": "This week’s Action Surge is packed. Big battles mean big conversations, and we had plenty to talk about once the dice finally stopped rolling. From the chaos at the table to the (lack of) chaos behind the screen, there was no shortage of moments to break down. We think it’s only fair to talk about what an incredible job Harry did. There was so much going on; the monsters, the cards, the chaos, and also those chromatic orbs, and somehow he kept hold of it all flawlessly (unlike the rest of us, who were mostly just panicking). But it wasn’t just Harry. Minis mean business, and once again Mark from Crafted Campaigns had been hard at work. And what work it was, seriously, how are we ever meant to go back to theatre of the mind after this? From there, we get into what made this battle so tense: why mobility matters so much for big bads, and how being able to move, and move quickly, can turn the tide (and keep Dolly running too). We also break down those bouncing orbs, chromatic and otherwise, and just how devastating they can be. Maybe a little too devastating, depending on who you ask. Alex opens up about his plans for I, the choice to gift healing, and how close things came to going catastrophically wrong. And of course, we circle back to the Deck of Many Friends, the latest companions it’s produced, and the question of whether Raidion would really ever have given it up. (Short answer: probably. Long answer: probably, but at least he had a plan.) Finally, we talk about the bigger picture: that moment of realisation where the party can’t back out anymore. They’re in too deep, the questions are piling up, and thankfully Elowen didn’t kill the one person who might actually be able to answer them. That’s progress! Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "Fate is fragile, light enough to turn on the flip of a coin, yet powerful enough to make pawns of those who thought themselves players. As the pieces move, the board shifts, and the game is never truly theirs to command. Yet deeper in the dark, power is spinning into something dangerous. Lives are drawn and discarded like cards in a hand, played without hesitation, and spent without remorse, for not everyone chooses to play fair. Despite strength and skill, the rules bend, the stakes rise, and even the best hand may falter when the cost is nothing less than your soul. To survive they must outlast, outthink, and never underestimate the one across the board. The rules may be broken, and the odds stacked against them, but now that the pieces are set, they cannot leave the board.

But at the heart of it all is I stepping into his moment, wrapping things up, and saying goodbye, because who doesn’t love a good story? Oh, and don’t forget to tell the hatchlings! We dive into Ben’s decision to go back and speak with Themself, when that choice was made, and what he hoped to find there. Of course, we can’t resist talking about Harry’s ever-expanding catalogue of kobold voices, and how the evolution of I shows just how far he’s come since his early hatchling days (chaos very much included). We also reflect on our frankly terrible track record with the children of Reliquiae, the joy of meeting old friends, and a few theories about what comes next.

In the quiet of the caverns, farewells are spoken, lessons are passed on, and even the smallest of tales can take root in unexpected ways. Some stories are mischief, shouted too loudly. Others are softer, carried in memory, pressed between moments that will never be written. A few are darker still, full of loss, of questions and discovery. And some teach that strength is not always chosen, that the weight of a blade can change the hand that wields it. But stories also belong to those who dare to leave them behind. To those who walk away not because they are forgotten, but because they choose to begin again. And beyond the dark, another tale waits to be told, of mushrooms, magic, and maybe a touch of madness.

      "description": "This week, we're turning Spoiler Chat on its head. Honestly? We’re keeping you lot fed. Because if Episode 36 gave us anything, it was answers…and about a dozen more questions to go with them. Before we get too deep into the lore spiral, we kick things off with a chat about mushroom monsters and the seemingly universal urge to run away from Mouse. Oh, and Raidion’s casually dropping level 4 spells like he’s trying to dim Dolly’s light (Rude). There’s clearly more going on in those caves than just a missing god, but let’s be real, this one’s all about that second half. We dig into what it means to take everyone along for the ride, what actually goes into meeting a god (including the prep time for DoubleJump), and the emotional fallout that follows. We try to unpack what’s really going on with Raidion, that magical deck of cards, and we debunk one of our Spoiler Chat’s most beloved theories (sorry Jazzy B). There’s plenty of theorising about Kelnys too, and both Alex and I, the character not the…you get the idea, gently reminding everyone that D&D is, and always will be, the most emotionally validating form of millennial therapy available. And finally, we look ahead. Did you see that coming? We didn’t. But there’s still plenty more to unpack, and the journey’s far from over. Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "Beneath root and ruin, the path winds deeper still. What begins as a descent soon reveals what lies below, and as the air thickens, the mind softens, and even the strongest start to slip. Some wander. Some wake. Others are already too far gone. A spark can be salvation, and there’s no time to mourn when the flames come fast. Still, there are moments to be found for those who look hard enough. A chance to recognise a face, to offer a way home, and to wonder if anyone ever truly returns the same. While answers may lie in the dark, they’re not always the ones we seek. Some truths echo, others accuse, and some have the power to reshape a story entirely. What they find is not certainty, but something older: the ache of wanting to belong, the fear of being forgotten, and the hope that someone might still be searching. Through smoke and story, memory and myth, they search for something real. The questions may outnumber the answers, but the way forward is clear enough if they choose to take it together.

      "description": "This week we began with a brief but vital chat about sitting on a d4. Look, we had it, so you need to listen to it. Mercifully, we then moved on to discussing I (the character, not the me) taking control of the narrative. We talked about the Gloam camp - what the players were expecting and how those expectations were confounded by reality. This led to discussion of overthinking and overplanning when it comes to encounters, and how the players can sometimes be their own worst enemies. Still, there was time to revel in a rare instance of a plan going off without a hitch. We ruminated on what was next for Mina Lavigne - widow of Azrel - and whether she would be able to avoid falling into the clutches of a midlife crisis, ending in her getting involved in one of the many multi level marketing schemes that blight Reliquiae. And that’s canon now. An extended discussion of bad smells and the fermented foods of Scandinavia led us (somehow) back to Somnium, body horror and the constraints that the three realms of existence place on Harry’s use of certain monsters. Our dear DM then went on what we can only describe as a bit of a rant about Reliable Talent being overpowered, and - speaking of overpowered - we discussed the potential destructive capacity of the greatsword Elowen looted from the body of Lilith. We finished by looking ahead to what might be lurking within the caves as the path leads ever downward towards… well, that’s for next time. Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "In the quiet of the forest, a plan begins to smoulder. While talent may prove reliable, it’s far from innocent, and with the air thick and heavy, not everyone is breathing easy. Some find themselves climbing to unexpected heights, though whether from inspiration or inhalation is anyone’s guess. In a forest where everything is watching, it pays to move carefully, speak softly, and keep the distractions loud. After all, subtlety is subjective, and when sabotage meets strategy, it can create a spark. Things shift quickly when the lines between brilliance and recklessness begin to go up in smoke. To move forward, they’ll need misdirection, momentum, and more than a little luck. Funny, how often the path to clarity begins with a little haze.

A little bit of travel, a bit of combat, and the newly dead once again proving that if you leave them alone long enough, they will start arguing. But let’s talk about that combat. Because honestly? This might have been our most Avengers moment yet. We were coordinated. We were flashy. We even got to see some new spells drop, and frankly, what’s not to love? We dig into how differently characters and players interpret information, and the lasting impact of choices made in the moment. Even, or especially, when you don’t have all the facts. Apparently that’s a theme this episode. Who knew? We also explore planning, morality, and the delightfully chaotic space where those two things don’t always agree. And filming day just so happened to be Mark from Crafted Campaigns’ birthday, so naturally, we shout him out in the most chaotic way possible. Happy birthday, Mark! Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "We start with energy. Chaotic energy. At the time of filming Episode 33, it had been nearly six weeks since we sat round the table and played a game of D&D together for our main campaign. And if you’ve been following us for a while, you’ll know we tend to get rather feral when we’ve been apart too long. But this episode is more than just our chaotic start. As we symbolically close one arc and step into a new chapter, we finally come together to explore not just Episode 33, but everything we’ve experienced in Haven. This week, we dig into Harry’s relationship with Parvis, the choices that were made, and the weight of those moments not just for him, but for the group as a whole. Alex even shares some kobold lore and gives us his take on how he thinks kobolds would say goodbye. And Harry doesn’t stop there. He offers a peek behind the DM screen and tells us what might have happened in Haven if the dice hadn’t been so kind to Dolly. Some of the team reveal their new feats as we level up (yes, Misty Step is in the mix for the least likely of candidates), and Doug reflects on what might be his most druid-like moment to date. He’s all candles and sandals now. Fully leaning in. And of course, we talk about Raidion, everyone’s favourite egg-obsessed elf, as the age-old question returns: can we change him? Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "Some goodbyes are felt only in silence, in the quiet closing of a chapter. Others are painted in colour and contemplation. Some choose to burn, their smoke rising as a final signal of what’s ended. Yet with every ending comes a new beginning, a moment to plant the seed of change, to learn, and to lead. As the pinks of dusk give way to yellows of a new dawn, hope begins to flower. Even the smallest act can become that seed, and there is power in planting something new, in growing, tending, and rebuilding. Sometimes, to grow, you must reach forward and relive the moments you once tried to leave behind. Grief still carves its path, and memories cling, like roots deep and tangled, hard to pull free. But a hand outstretched is a burden shared and a future sown. And in the wake of summer’s end, the world continues to turn. Leaves fall. Air shifts. And, somewhere between dusk and dawn, and the lush green of summer, the reds of autumn arrive. Growth is rarely easy, but adventure always has a way of finding the light.

But the weight of what did, didn’t, and almost happened left us emotionally and physically drained. Worth it? Absolutely. This was a true reunion, for both players and characters, and the Newly Dead came back together in the only way they know how: dealing (and taking) a healthy dose of damage. At least they weren’t fighting each other this time, right? In this episode of Action Surge, Harry guides his tired little soldiers through an episode full of death, barters, secrets, and desperation to break down what might be our most impressive team-building exercise to date. (Though Hollie is still convinced Elowen could’ve taken him if it came down to it. And it almost did.) Now that the party’s reunited, it’s time to start trading secrets. Aoife opens up about Dolly and Reliquiae’s most toxic ex-boyfriend, while Alex insists certain details stay under wraps, for now, to give them the space they need to breathe…and, in some cases, to grieve. Ben, as ever, has thoughts about hit points and how much he enjoys having them just so he can lose them. Oh, and there’s nothing quite like a Chromatic Orb finally hitting and bouncing. In his defence, it was incredibly satisfying! And is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it’s Kelnys, whose incredible dragon wings and third level healing spells just about kept the team on their feet. Well almost. A few still hit the deck. Someone’s got to help pick up the pieces, right Doug? Speaking of decks, the cards once again proved they are absolutely not what anyone expects. But hey, at least we managed to avoid adding a new edition to the pack. Oh, and what can we say? Crafted Campaigns has once again outdone themselves. And we’re pretty sure both Elowen and I would agree: the thought of running up and down the stairs in that place again is, quite frankly, exhausting. Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "Bartering takes many forms. Life for life. Belief for power. Captivity for freedom. But not every exchange is forced. Sometimes, trust is given freely, without trade or consequence. Yet it isn’t always magic, or steel, that saves you. Sometimes all that remains is faith, and the hope that those whom fate has tangled into your story will be there to catch you when you fall. And together, even the chill of death feels less certain. While it may linger, searching for peace in whatever form it can find, the strength to stare it in the face rarely comes from standing alone. At the end of it all, it’s the promise of the first strike, and the weight of the last, that leaves the deepest mark.

      "description": "We’ve tried, but this time, it just wasn’t possible. With so many secrets flying around, we had no choice but to continue the theme and split the party for Action Surge too. On the plus side, all that getting up and down from the table probably means none of us are getting a DVT. Silver linings. As you may have guessed, these episode descriptions are written by someone who is not the DM, which means this person was neither in the room for all of episode 31 nor for all of Action Surge. So, in this episode, we break down everything we can from episode 31, reflecting on the highs, the lows, and the revelations in between. It’s a tale of two halves, or three. And quite honestly, unless you’re Harry, you should be grateful you even got that much. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

Some find strength in solitude, standing where no one else can, even when what you discover isn’t what you meant to seek. Sometimes rest brings revelation. And sometimes revelation brings a cost. We sacrifice pieces of ourselves, and sometimes others, in the hope that something else might be spared. Not every card in the deck is meant to be played. Some are drawn. Some are taken.

      "description": "It’s all going really well… until it isn’t. In this episode of Action Surge, Harry reflects on the delicate balance between giving players freedom and pushing them toward the decisions that matter. Aoife opens up about being the centre of attention, how she doesn’t always love it, how Dolly handles it, and why it’s easier when it’s on her own terms. We break down how a perfectly timed natural 20 can stop someone from being alone, and how the dice really do weave their own story. Speaking of stories, we also dive into the importance of knowing when to step back. Just because you can do something, doesn’t mean you should, sometimes the best kind of play is letting someone else have the spotlight. Harry also shares the roles he feels most at home in, and how his charm nearly had Alex believing every word. (Key word: nearly. That liar’s smile gave it away.) And as for not being at the table? Doug is all for it. Why? Because it means there are surprises in store. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

While the Gloam do not welcome their arrival, the Children of the Midnight Moon fall silent, awestruck, as the goddess they have waited for appears before them, though not all who are worshipped come willingly. The Newly Dead came seeking answers, not adoration, but under the eyes of the Midnight Moon, promises twist into chains, and worship becomes a cage.

This week on Action Surge, Harry starts things off by expressing how deeply grateful he is that we filmed Episode 29 on a Sunday, not a Saturday. Apparently, he wasn’t prepared for... well, any of it. Which means, clearly, we’re winning D&D. That’s how you win, right? Just completely ignore whatever your DM had planned. And sorry again to Mark at Crafted Campaigns. We unpack our rather bold approach to this episode. Stealth hasn’t exactly been our strong suit lately, so this time we took the front door. Literally. And Dolly? Dolly was the ticket in. Harry talks about the challenge of running two groups simultaneously in the same location, on the same timeline, acting separately, and what happens when they maybe start to overlap. He might have been stressed, but we’ve got to say, it didn’t show. Hollie and Doug share what it’s like being up and down from the table throughout the episode, and how that affects focus and energy. Also, for the first time in a very long time, we didn’t have music in the room. Why? Because the recording PC exploded right before filming. Literally. No music, just chaos (and a slight electric shock for our Producer, Tom). We also take a moment to celebrate Alex’s spotlight and how Harry fully embraced the chance to get inside his head, purely to mess with him of course. Reliable Talent absolutely came in clutch, and we’re all looking forward to seeing where I leads us. And yes, Parvus gets a little love too. We really don’t mean to forget him. Sorry, Parvus. We love you. Honestly. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

As one takes a risk and disappears into the shadows, moving with nothing but silence and sheer nerve, as another stumbles into something far stranger. Learning of an old acquaintance with a new name, and a following that worships the Midnight Moon. Between whispered conversations and quiet revelations, not everything is as it seems. And not everyone is who they believed themselves to be. They have a plan: Bold. Dangerous. Direct. This time they might see them coming, but let them kneel. For the bowed head cannot see the blade.

We kick things off with a quick reflection on the episode that saw Dolly temporarily hoofing it back to the battle, because when the plan falls apart, sometimes four legs really are better than two . The Gloam might say anyone can put on a cloak, but infiltrating their ranks? That’s another story. We reflect on the fight, the messiness, and the distinct lack of a plan that got us there. Honestly, no notes. Harry shares what it’s like prepping for this sandbox chapter of the campaign, including the unique joy of trying to anticipate every possible route, decision, and chaotic left turn. Spoiler: it involves keeping Crafted Campaigns on speed dial. There’s also a little breathing room this episode, some sun, some levity, and some wonderful Kelnys content. Is this our favourite version of Kel yet? Or maybe it’s drunk Kel? Possibly hungry Kel? We’ll take them all, thanks. We dive into a deeper discussion about Somnium, how Harry and Doug worked together to keep the experience informed but still surprising, and why that one little mushroom is giving the party more than a little cause for concern. And finally, we chat alignment. Who likes it? Who doesn’t? And why it might be time we all embraced a little moral flexibility. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

Beneath the trees, secrets are traded, not in whispers, but in truth. And in that rare stillness, something begins to mend. But peace in this place is fleeting. Not everything that grows in the forest should be picked. A promise of clarity, past, present, and future is laid bare. But for those who’ve seen what it really does, that promise is more curse than blessing. And when danger rears its head, there’s no time to reflect. Spells fly, plans shatter, and four legs are better than two. It’s messy. It’s wild. And it’s absolutely no time for horsing around.

      "description": "No Alex this week, but we do have champagne courtesy of Dr Kagon, so honestly, who's complaining? If Elowen and Dolly can’t have bottomless brunch, then Hollie and Aoife absolutely will. Episode 27 gave us lore, chaos, and one very dramatic amphibian moment. A true episode of two halves: story-rich setups and an epic (and slightly froggy) fight that saw the cast go toe to webbed toe with a creature beautifully brought to life by Mark at Crafted Campaigns. Honestly, give them their flowers, the minis stole the scene (as usual). Ben reflects on how these big battles often give us more than just combat, and this one was no exception. With the portal open and the dust settling, it feels like the end of a season, and knowing our love for a good 13-episode arc, we’re excited to see where we end up! Despite how seamlessly it all came together, Harry admits this episode had plenty of last-minute changes. Yes, that includes adding the death roll. (Don’t worry, Dolly didn’t go swimming. This time.) We’re all in favour of convincing Harry to release those monster stats on Patreon. It’s what the community deserves. We also talk about Johnny Chiodini’s incredible contribution to the episode via their Deck of Many Friends card, and how much more comfortable the cast has become in bringing those cards into play. Even if it means we now have two Oxventure members scrapping at our table. There’s also speculation aplenty as we attempt to piece together what we think we’ve uncovered and what this portal might mean for us as we travel across Reliquiae. But perhaps the best part? Watching Harry finally share the tiniest crumbs of lore he’s been hoarding since session zero. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

      "description": "The tunnels twist on, pressing in from all sides. Pressure, as they say, can forge diamonds, but will the Newly Dead begin to shine? Each step deeper into the dark forces them to confront what lies beneath, not just in the stone, but in themselves. Old wounds ache. Doubts gnaw. And when shadows twist and fear creeps in, it’s not just trust that wavers. But not everything in the dark is there to break them. Some things, surprisingly, ask for nothing at all. Still, the path out won’t be smooth. Something’s waiting in the muck. Something with a taste for adventurers...and a ribbeting sense of timing. The Newly Dead might be ready to hop out of these tunnels, but first? They’ll have to leap into a fight unlike any they’ve faced before.

      "description": "We begin, once more, inside Raidion… This week, we’re deep in it. Blighted, bruised, and still somehow standing. We kick things off with yet another reminder that balancing fights for this party is…a challenge to say the least (Sorry, Harry). When your main damage dealer misses every hit and the enemy still drops? That’s tricky, to say the least. Ben unpacks Raidion’s fearlessness, his willingness to throw himself in the line of fire (blight and all), and how that ties into deeper themes of mortality and purpose. Meanwhile, Aoife dives into Dolly’s mindset, and why going after Kelnys wasn’t just emotional, it was necessary. But with doubts creeping in, is she starting to unravel? We also dig into the strange, symbiotic relationship between Parvus and Themself. Is Parvus the anti-Antiqua? We talk divine fallout, cosmic expectations, and the tension brewing between him and the rest of the old gods’ chosen. And what’s the deal with those underground groves? Flowers. Trees. Lush green life where there shouldn’t be any. Was Themself behind it? Who designed these caves, and why? Harry gives us a peek behind the curtain into his vision for the various Kobold tribes and how he and Alex imagined the architecture of I’s tunnels. We also explore what it means to run Parvus as a DMPC, and how that character balances between being part of the story and shaping it from within. Let’s just say the caves aren’t the only things layered. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

      "description": "Bruised, broken, and some even blighted, the Newly Dead take their first steps into the depths, seeking the elusive Kobold God, Themself. But in the winding caves below, where the history and stories of the Kobold tribes echo through the stone, there are far worse things to fear than what lurks in the dark. The weight of their own doubts press heavy, as whispers from The Web weave their way into wary minds, trust is tested, and resolve begins to fray. The Web would see them buried, but in the endless tunnels, can they claw their way back to the light and continue the fight?

      "description": "The atmosphere this week? Thiccc. Yes, with three C's! Tensions are high as we break down the heavy conversation between Dolly and Raidion, and the impact it had on the entire party. Some moments leave a mark, but this one really lingered. We also dive into the importance of laying ground rules between players, especially when characters come in hot. Navigating those intense moments isn’t always easy, but building trust at the table makes all the difference. The best moments? They come from knowing we’ve got each other’s backs, as players and as friends. Of course, we can’t forget those sending stones. A blessing and a curse, those tricky little things have a way of stirring the pot, and this week was no exception. Harry also opens up about a mistake he made this episode (yes, even he makes them too!). Meanwhile, Doug reflects on the chaotic joy of battling the purple worm, though perhaps less joyfully on the whole being digested part. Harry also shares the challenge of balancing combat for a party like ours and how the BBC Breakfast Show (yes, really) ended up being an unexpected training ground. We also discuss the fracture between Themself and Parvus, and what their reunion could mean, not just for them, but for I as well. Alex, of course, is playing his cards close to his chest. Join us as we unpack all of this and more, and don't worry, we'd still love you even if you were a worm! Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",

This week, we dive into Wildshape with an emphasis on the wild , as Kelnys goes full feral—in more ways than one. Some days, you really do just want a fight. Speaking of chaos, we also reflect on the longest we’ve ever been a split party and the unpredictability that came with it. Of course, we can’t ignore Harry’s ring—wait, no, not like that! We mean the rings. Look, there are threads, chapters, legions, and now rings are at play here, and honestly? We are not necessarily mature enough for this. This episode also marked our first real conversation with the Gloam, and, well… they weren’t exactly what we expected. Raidion, naturally, wants to pick apart everything. Meanwhile, we break down Kelnys’ state of mind immediately following such a major revelation, and we analyse that sending stone message—what it means for Dolly, and how it could impact everyone.

Unfortunately, everyone except Doug had completely forgotten that, leading to an unforgettable (and gravity-assisted) trip from the top of The Sanctum to the lake below. When the dice dictate the options, you just have to roll with it… literally. Ben dives into the philosophy of putting the story first, even when it puts Raidion in serious jeopardy. We also take a moment to reflect on Yilda’s Bond Villain Syndrome —making a dramatic exit before making sure the job was actually finished. Meanwhile, we entertain the absolute chaos that would unfold if Aska was ever truly let loose on Mouse… and, more importantly, on Elowen’s brothers. Finally, Alex shares more about I’s state of mind as the journey to the Old Dark looms ever closer. How has I’s outlook shifted over time? What’s weighing on him most?

      "description": "As the storm rages and the rain lashes down, it becomes clear the Newly Dead will find no sanctuary in the Sanctum. To secure their future, they must take a leap of faith into uncharted waters. Rest, however, is fleeting as unexpected dangers test their resolve and challenge their faith in everything they once believed to be true. Secrets are shared, tempers flare, and those thought lost may be closer than they ever imagined. Their journey may lead them to the old home of the gods, a place where divine decisions and magic once shaped Reliquiae. But whatever answers they hope to find, they are not the only ones seeking them. In a world where identity is fragile, me, you, and I must unite to face what lies ahead.

      "description": "We’ve not cried like this since Armageddon! The gang sat down for a full-on session of millennial therapy after our most intense episode yet. We discuss the power of storytelling, emotional whiplash and the joy of seeing long planned moments come to fruition at the table. Harry reveals previously unseen chambers of the Sanctum model, the inevitability of Erastus Gracey, and reflects on the magic created when players do something entirely unexpected. There’s chat about mastering mechanics, the dice telling the story, and reveals that offer more questions than answers. Plus we delve into a new piece of music in the episode and reveal the inspiration behind it. Though short a Ben Starr for much of this instalment, we remained rich in ideas, innuendos and chat. It’s what he would have wanted.

If you’ve ever been on the fence about joining us for our post-show breakdowns, this episode is the perfect showcase of the insights, surprises, and behind-the-scenes details that make it all worth it. Harry dives into the enigmatic power of The Wasp, while Doug reflects on Kelnys’ “should’ve, could’ve, would’ve” decision-making. Together, they unpack the fascinating role of happenstance during Kel’s shapeshifting moment. We also chat about our uncanny knack for making—and breaking—new friendships (surely a record this time?), Harry’s plans to delve deeper into Raidion’s memories, Alex’s experience of playing a character defined by discovery rather than secrets, and, of course, Dolly’s moment of destructive brilliance (she really packs a punch when she wants to!). Action Surge is Natural Six's fortnightly post-show debrief, where Dungeon Master Harry and the cast break down their favourite moments, their regrets, and any theories from the Dungeons and Dragons session they've just played, as well as adding their thoughts and hopes for future play.

Harry shares unused story ideas, while we highlight the value of asking players about their characters' thoughts—offering insights dice can’t deliver.

As the Fortis Legion tightens its grip, the Newly Dead find it increasingly difficult to conceal their identities. Danger surrounds them, yet the bonds of friendship between them grow ever stronger. Amid the mists of the Salt Road, long-buried secrets and feelings begin to come to light. A chance meeting may not only hold the key to someone’s past but help unlock the path forward. Yet even as flickers of hope emerge and answers feel close, the path ahead remains perilous—The Sanctum may not be the sanctuary they seek. Natural Six are Harry McEntire, Doug Cockle, Ben Starr, Hollie Bennett, Alex Jordan, and Aoife Wilson. #NaturalSix #dnd #dungeonsanddragons #ttrpg #actualplay Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "Join us as we decompress and unpack an emotional rollercoaster filled with tough choices and unexpected chaos. We discuss how we navigate pacing and the tricky nature of fast travel. Also, what lessons can we learn from bat-frog and the age-old wisdom of “maybe don't lick mysterious things” (unless you roll a Nat 20, of course)? Plus, we dive into that luck check in Veil—what could it have meant? And, of course, the biggest moral dilemma of them all: to kill or not to kill? Also, a word to the wise: drink responsibly (or risk the wrath of wine-xiety). Action Surge is Natural Six's fortnightly post-show debrief, where Dungeon Master Harry and the cast break down their favourite moments, their regrets, and any theories from the Dungeons and Dragons session they've just played, as well as adding their thoughts and hopes for future play. #NaturalSix #dnd #dungeonsanddragons #ttrpg #actualplay Hosted on Acast.

      "description": "While continuing their journey to The Sanctum, the allure of Veil proves too powerful to resist. Once alive with vibrant colours, joy, and music, the city now carries the weight of sorrow as its people mourn the loss of their God. Yet, even in grief, the Tieflings celebrate with songs of life and tales of great deeds. But beneath the melodies, danger stirs in unexpected ways. A reckless cocktail of drinks and missteps could lead to dire consequences, a sobering reminder that one careless moment might cost them everything.
