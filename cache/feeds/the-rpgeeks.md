      "description": "Newcomer Sugar has come to the Harriers with a proposal: Help deal with the new competition from the Branch Twins and clear the crew's debt with The Wraiths. As dusk turns and fades to twilight and the fog swirls through the streets, the gangs of Duskvol head out once more to fight each other over scraps of power. Little do they know that a new threat is appearing on the horizon... Join our crew of daring scoundrels Emily Bates, Shamini Bundell, Lou Fryer and Holly Musgrave, along with Fate Weaver Fiona Howat, as they seek their fortunes on the haunted streets of an industrial-fantasy city. With guest player Josephine McAdam! There are heists, chases, occult mysteries, dangerous bargains, bloody skirmishes, and, above all, riches to be had — if they are bold enough to seize them. Our fledgling crew must thrive amidst the threats of rival gangs, powerful noble families, vengeful ghosts, the Bluecoats of the city watch, and the siren song of their own vices. Will they rise to power in the criminal underworld? Content Warnings: Violence, Gang Warfare, Drugs, Murder, Death, Ghosts, Vice indulging, Subterfuge.

The invitation reads: You are cordially invited to the exclusive midnight showing of the Cecil Throne Art Centre. After more than three decades Guy Vauquelin's entire Triumph De La Mort collection, known as the Atrocity Exhibition, will be presented to the public. A mad virtuoso, a dark propher, Vauquelin's infamy surrounds him like a miasma. Rumored to have studied at Death's feet, his insight resonates within his macabrely beautiful paintings, entrancing and horrifying viewers with their apocalyptic visions. Consumed by madness and hedonism, he ended his own life, leaving behind his artistic legacy. Credits GM Fiona K.T.
