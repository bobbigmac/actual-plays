      "description": "This is Part One of DADHAMMER 40,000 – a new Patreon bonus mini series where Matt has used the Warhammer 40,000 Wrath and Glory system to guide us through the cruelest and bloodiest world imaginable. It begins one fateful morning on the remote dwarf planet Navis IV where we meet four lowly cogs in the Imperium of Man machine when a powerful unexpected visitor -- an Inquisitor relentlessly pursuing a dangerous traitor -- turns all of their lives inside out. The Peachyville Horror will return November 5th! This episode contains Violence, Profanity, Sexual Content, and Violence Towards Children.

Plus composer Maxton Waller stops by to talk about the marching band version of the season two theme song and they answer some questions about the most memorable records and everyone's favorite intros from the second season.
