      "description": "Laxi is an alien visitor from the noble house of vlarg who doesn’t like to conquer planets by force—at least not at first. Invasion and domination are boring, conventional, and these days even the elders on their home planet agree. Instead, Laxi prefers to spend time on the world they intend to capture, sowing instability from within before making their big move. Earth, however, is proving to be a bigger challenge than expected, but Laxi may have just come up with the right marketing scheme. This is “What Women Want,” read and written by Katherine Tunning.",
