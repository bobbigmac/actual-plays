The Reign of Emrys follows the adventures of a diverse band of heroes as they find their destinies intertwine with both one another and the fate of their nation. Welcome to the first homebrew campaign we've ever put on the podcast! Reign of Emrys ran through 2021 and was a fantastic dive into our homebrew world of Ylos. The audio wasn't intended for podcast, but we've cleaned it up as much as we can. None of us are audio engineers, but if you have any pointers we'd be happy to hear them. Quick note: at the start of this this campaign, Katrina had not yet begun her transition. In fact, that actually began it midway through this campaign, so many of you who know her today may not even recognize her old name, which is how it should be. She's given her expressed consent to share this and we have nothing appreciation, love, and respect for her. #dungeonsanddragons #dnd #5e #dorktales #fantasy #actualplay #liveplay #rpg #podcast #d20 #ttrpg #homebrew === Watch us LIVE on Twitch ► http://twitch.tv/dorktales Our Linktree ► https://linktr.ee/dorktales Join our Discord ► https://discord.gg/zVtE9Ab Follow our Twitter ► https://twitter.com/dork_tales/ Follow our Instagram ► https://instagram.com/dorktaleschannel/ Find us on Facebook ► https://www.facebook.com/dorktaleschannel/ Listen to our Podcast ► https://dorktales.podbean.com Support the show on Patreon ► https://www.patreon.com/dorktales/ Buy the cast a coffee ► https://ko-fi.com/dorktales Buy official Dork Tales Merch ► https://teepublic.com/user/dorktales ► https://dorktalesstore.redbubble.com Character Art by hailiiz!

The Reign of Emrys follows the adventures of a diverse band of heroes as they find their destinies intertwine with both one another and the fate of their nation. Welcome to the first homebrew campaign we've ever put on the podcast! Reign of Emrys ran through 2021 and was a fantastic dive into our homebrew world of Ylos. The audio wasn't intended for podcast, but we've cleaned it up as much as we can. None of us are audio engineers, but if you have any pointers we'd be happy to hear them. Quick note: at the start of this this campaign, Katrina had not yet begun her transition. In fact, that actually began it midway through this campaign, so many of you who know her today may not even recognize her old name, which is how it should be. She's given her expressed consent to share this and we have nothing appreciation, love, and respect for her. #dungeonsanddragons #dnd #5e #dorktales #fantasy #actualplay #liveplay #rpg #podcast #d20 #ttrpg #homebrew === Watch us LIVE on Twitch ► http://twitch.tv/dorktales Our Linktree ► https://linktr.ee/dorktales Join our Discord ► https://discord.gg/zVtE9Ab Follow our Twitter ► https://twitter.com/dork_tales/ Follow our Instagram ► https://instagram.com/dorktaleschannel/ Find us on Facebook ► https://www.facebook.com/dorktaleschannel/ Listen to our Podcast ► https://dorktales.podbean.com Support the show on Patreon ► https://www.patreon.com/dorktales/ Buy the cast a coffee ► https://ko-fi.com/dorktales Buy official Dork Tales Merch ► https://teepublic.com/user/dorktales ► https://dorktalesstore.redbubble.com Character Art by hailiiz!

She's given her expressed consent to share this and we have nothing appreciation, love, and respect for her. #dungeonsanddragons #dnd #5e #dorktales #fantasy #actualplay #liveplay #rpg #podcast #d20 #ttrpg #homebrew === Watch us LIVE on Twitch ► http://twitch.tv/dorktales Our Linktree ► https://linktr.ee/dorktales Join our Discord ► https://discord.gg/zVtE9Ab Follow our Twitter ► https://twitter.com/dork_tales/ Follow our Instagram ► https://instagram.com/dorktaleschannel/ Find us on Facebook ► https://www.facebook.com/dorktaleschannel/ Listen to our Podcast ► https://dorktales.podbean.com Support the show on Patreon ► https://www.patreon.com/dorktales/ Buy the cast a coffee ► https://ko-fi.com/dorktales Buy official Dork Tales Merch ► https://teepublic.com/user/dorktales ► https://dorktalesstore.redbubble.com Character Art by hailiiz!

The Reign of Emrys follows the adventures of a diverse band of heroes as they find their destinies intertwine with both one another and the fate of their nation. Welcome to the first homebrew campaign we've ever put on the podcast! Reign of Emrys ran through 2021 and was a fantastic dive into our homebrew world of Ylos. The audio wasn't intended for podcast, but we've cleaned it up as much as we can. None of us are audio engineers, but if you have any pointers we'd be happy to hear them. Quick note: at the start of this this campaign, Katrina had not yet begun her transition. In fact, that actually began it midway through this campaign, so many of you who know her today may not even recognize her old name, which is how it should be. She's given her expressed consent to share this and we have nothing appreciation, love, and respect for her. #dungeonsanddragons #dnd #5e #dorktales #fantasy #actualplay #liveplay #rpg #podcast #d20 #ttrpg #homebrew === Watch us LIVE on Twitch ► http://twitch.tv/dorktales Our Linktree ► https://linktr.ee/dorktales Join our Discord ► https://discord.gg/zVtE9Ab Follow our Twitter ► https://twitter.com/dork_tales/ Follow our Instagram ► https://instagram.com/dorktaleschannel/ Find us on Facebook ► https://www.facebook.com/dorktaleschannel/ Listen to our Podcast ► https://dorktales.podbean.com Support the show on Patreon ► https://www.patreon.com/dorktales/ Buy the cast a coffee ► https://ko-fi.com/dorktales Buy official Dork Tales Merch ► https://teepublic.com/user/dorktales ► https://dorktalesstore.redbubble.com Character Art by hailiiz!

Welcome to the first homebrew campaign we've ever put on the podcast! Reign of Emrys ran through 2021 and was a fantastic dive into our homebrew world of Ylos. The audio wasn't intended for podcast, but we've cleaned it up as much as we can. None of us are audio engineers, but if you have any pointers we'd be happy to hear them. Quick note: at the start of this this campaign, Katrina had not yet begun her transition. In fact, that actually began it midway through this campaign, so many of you who know her today may not even recognize her old name, which is how it should be.

The Reign of Emrys follows the adventures of a diverse band of heroes as they find their destinies intertwine with both one another and the fate of their nation. Welcome to the first homebrew campaign we've ever put on the podcast! Reign of Emrys ran through 2021 and was a fantastic dive into our homebrew world of Ylos. The audio wasn't intended for podcast, but we've cleaned it up as much as we can. None of us are audio engineers, but if you have any pointers we'd be happy to hear them. Quick note: at the start of this this campaign, Katrina had not yet begun her transition. In fact, that actually began it midway through this campaign, so many of you who know her today may not even recognize her old name, which is how it should be. She's given her expressed consent to share this and we have nothing appreciation, love, and respect for her. #dungeonsanddragons #dnd #5e #dorktales #fantasy #actualplay #liveplay #rpg #podcast #d20 #ttrpg #homebrew === Watch us LIVE on Twitch ► http://twitch.tv/dorktales Our Linktree ► https://linktr.ee/dorktales Join our Discord ► https://discord.gg/zVtE9Ab Follow our Twitter ► https://twitter.com/dork_tales/ Follow our Instagram ► https://instagram.com/dorktaleschannel/ Find us on Facebook ► https://www.facebook.com/dorktaleschannel/ Listen to our Podcast ► https://dorktales.podbean.com Support the show on Patreon ► https://www.patreon.com/dorktales/ Buy the cast a coffee ► https://ko-fi.com/dorktales Buy official Dork Tales Merch ► https://teepublic.com/user/dorktales ► https://dorktalesstore.redbubble.com Character Art by hailiiz!

The party confronts Dr. Otker and everything goes as expected. The Reign of Emrys follows the adventures of a diverse band of heroes as they find their destinies intertwine with both one another and the fate of their nation. Welcome to the first homebrew campaign we've ever put on the podcast! Reign of Emrys ran through 2021 and was a fantastic dive into our homebrew world of Ylos. The audio wasn't intended for podcast, but we've cleaned it up as much as we can. None of us are audio engineers, but if you have any pointers we'd be happy to hear them. Quick note: at the start of this this campaign, Katrina had not yet begun her transition. In fact, that actually began it midway through this campaign, so many of you who know her today may not even recognize her old name, which is how it should be. She's given her expressed consent to share this and we have nothing appreciation, love, and respect for her. #dungeonsanddragons #dnd #5e #dorktales #fantasy #actualplay #liveplay #rpg #podcast #d20 #ttrpg #homebrew === Watch us LIVE on Twitch ► http://twitch.tv/dorktales Our Linktree ► https://linktr.ee/dorktales Join our Discord ► https://discord.gg/zVtE9Ab Follow our Twitter ► https://twitter.com/dork_tales/ Follow our Instagram ► https://instagram.com/dorktaleschannel/ Find us on Facebook ► https://www.facebook.com/dorktaleschannel/ Listen to our Podcast ► https://dorktales.podbean.com Support the show on Patreon ► https://www.patreon.com/dorktales/ Buy the cast a coffee ► https://ko-fi.com/dorktales Buy official Dork Tales Merch ► https://teepublic.com/user/dorktales ► https://dorktalesstore.redbubble.com Character Art by hailiiz!

The Reign of Emrys follows the adventures of a diverse band of heroes as they find their destinies intertwine with both one another and the fate of their nation. Welcome to the first homebrew campaign we've ever put on the podcast! Reign of Emrys ran through 2021 and was a fantastic dive into our homebrew world of Ylos. The audio wasn't intended for podcast, but we've cleaned it up as much as we can. None of us are audio engineers, but if you have any pointers we'd be happy to hear them. Quick note: at the start of this this campaign, Katrina had not yet begun her transition. In fact, that actually began it midway through this campaign, so many of you who know her today may not even recognize her old name, which is how it should be. She's given her expressed consent to share this and we have nothing appreciation, love, and respect for her. #dungeonsanddragons #dnd #5e #dorktales #fantasy #actualplay #liveplay #rpg #podcast #d20 #ttrpg #homebrew === Watch us LIVE on Twitch ► http://twitch.tv/dorktales Our Linktree ► https://linktr.ee/dorktales Join our Discord ► https://discord.gg/zVtE9Ab Follow our Twitter ► https://twitter.com/dork_tales/ Follow our Instagram ► https://instagram.com/dorktaleschannel/ Find us on Facebook ► https://www.facebook.com/dorktaleschannel/ Listen to our Podcast ► https://dorktales.podbean.com Support the show on Patreon ► https://www.patreon.com/dorktales/ Buy the cast a coffee ► https://ko-fi.com/dorktales Buy official Dork Tales Merch ► https://teepublic.com/user/dorktales ► https://dorktalesstore.redbubble.com Character Art by hailiiz!

      "description": "In this episode, the party is forced to fight a strange angelic being hellbent on killing Imperial Magus Lancea Quarto. Meanwhile, the fallout of Zete's gunfight is addressed by other members of the party. The Reign of Emrys follows the adventures of a diverse band of heroes as they find their destinies intertwine with both one another and the fate of their nation. Welcome to the first homebrew campaign we've ever put on the podcast! Reign of Emrys ran through 2021 and was a fantastic dive into our homebrew world of Ylos. The audio wasn't intended for podcast, but we've cleaned it up as much as we can. None of us are audio engineers, but if you have any pointers we'd be happy to hear them. Quick note: at the start of this this campaign, Katrina had not yet begun her transition. In fact, that actually began it midway through this campaign, so many of you who know her today may not even recognize her old name, which is how it should be. She's given her expressed consent to share this and we have nothing appreciation, love, and respect for her. #dungeonsanddragons #dnd #5e #dorktales #fantasy #actualplay #liveplay #rpg #podcast #d20 #ttrpg #homebrew === Watch us LIVE on Twitch ► http://twitch.tv/dorktales Our Linktree ► https://linktr.ee/dorktales Join our Discord ► https://discord.gg/zVtE9Ab Follow our Twitter ► https://twitter.com/dork_tales/ Follow our Instagram ► https://instagram.com/dorktaleschannel/ Find us on Facebook ► https://www.facebook.com/dorktaleschannel/ Listen to our Podcast ► https://dorktales.podbean.com Support the show on Patreon ► https://www.patreon.com/dorktales/ Buy the cast a coffee ► https://ko-fi.com/dorktales Buy official Dork Tales Merch ► https://teepublic.com/user/dorktales ► https://dorktalesstore.redbubble.com Character Art by hailiiz!

      "description": "In this episode, the party delves into a secret passage off of the train tunnel to search for what might have sealed them in. What strange things will they find inside the dark and deep places? The Reign of Emrys follows the adventures of a diverse band of heroes as they find their destinies intertwine with both one another and the fate of their nation. Welcome to the first homebrew campaign we've ever put on the podcast! Reign of Emrys ran through 2021 and was a fantastic dive into our homebrew world of Ylos. The audio wasn't intended for podcast, but we've cleaned it up as much as we can. None of us are audio engineers, but if you have any pointers we'd be happy to hear them. Quick note: at the start of this this campaign, Katrina had not yet begun her transition. In fact, that actually began it midway through this campaign, so many of you who know her today may not even recognize her old name, which is how it should be. She's given her expressed consent to share this and we have nothing appreciation, love, and respect for her. #dungeonsanddragons #dnd #5e #dorktales #fantasy #actualplay #liveplay #rpg #podcast #d20 #ttrpg #homebrew === Watch us LIVE on Twitch ► http://twitch.tv/dorktales Our Linktree ► https://linktr.ee/dorktales Join our Discord ► https://discord.gg/zVtE9Ab Follow our Twitter ► https://twitter.com/dork_tales/ Follow our Instagram ► https://instagram.com/dorktaleschannel/ Find us on Facebook ► https://www.facebook.com/dorktaleschannel/ Listen to our Podcast ► https://dorktales.podbean.com Support the show on Patreon ► https://www.patreon.com/dorktales/ Buy the cast a coffee ► https://ko-fi.com/dorktales Buy official Dork Tales Merch ► https://teepublic.com/user/dorktales ► https://dorktalesstore.redbubble.com Character Art by hailiiz!

The audio wasn't intended for podcast, but we've cleaned it up as much as we can. None of us are audio engineers, but if you have any pointers we'd be happy to hear them. Quick note: at the start of this this campaign, Katrina had not yet begun her transition. In fact, that actually began it midway through this campaign, so many of you who know her today may not even recognize her old name, which is how it should be. She's given her expressed consent to share this and we have nothing appreciation, love, and respect for her. #dungeonsanddragons #dnd #5e #dorktales #fantasy #actualplay #liveplay #rpg #podcast #d20 #ttrpg #homebrew === Watch us LIVE on Twitch ► http://twitch.tv/dorktales Our Linktree ► https://linktr.ee/dorktales Join our Discord ► https://discord.gg/zVtE9Ab Follow our Twitter ► https://twitter.com/dork_tales/ Follow our Instagram ► https://instagram.com/dorktaleschannel/ Find us on Facebook ► https://www.facebook.com/dorktaleschannel/ Listen to our Podcast ► https://dorktales.podbean.com Support the show on Patreon ► https://www.patreon.com/dorktales/ Buy the cast a coffee ► https://ko-fi.com/dorktales Buy official Dork Tales Merch ► https://teepublic.com/user/dorktales ► https://dorktalesstore.redbubble.com Character Art by hailiiz!

How does the Witchlight Carnival work and how can new and veteran DMs alike manage this incredibly complex bit of story-focused game design? We received a lot of feedback about how we've handled the game and even more requests for advice, so this seemed like a good way to hop in and help between the chapters ( and also, Christa is quite sick thanks to her nephews, so it was a good compromise). Don't worry: we'll return to our normal game next week with Episode 4! Did you like this episode? We'd like to do more content like this in the future and your feedback helps us know what works and what doesn't! Please let us know!
