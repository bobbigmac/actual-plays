Chris first appeared on the show back in August 2021 and it's fair to say a LOT has happened with Chris since then, including winning the last series of Strictly Come Dancing! You can listen to his his first appearance HERE (Series 3 Episode 12) His new autobiography book 'Keep Laughing' is out now. Already one of the country's best loved comedians, Chris McCausland's participation on Strictly was a phenomenon. But how did the boy from Liverpool end up winning the hearts of the nation? This is his remarkable story, of a twenty-five-year journey through sight loss to blindness. Of the highs, the lows and the downright hilarious along the way. From being a lowlife conker dealer, and running his very own bootlegging empire (kind of) . . . to almost becoming a spy for MI5 (really) . . . And of how he dared himself to try stand-up comedy, and ended up being brilliant on all your favourite TV shows. Before, of course, he surprised himself, as well as everybody else, when he tried dancing on live TV in front of millions. Warm, honest, insightful and laugh-out-loud funny, this is the most likeable, cheering and uplifting book of the year!

Leanne was the winner of the latest series of The Traitors UK 2025 and ambassador for Cancer Research UK. **TRIGGER WARNING** This episode contains discussions of IVF, C-sections and premature childbirth. Leanne is swapping the round table for the turn table as she takes on her next big challenge of running this year’s Race for Life to raise vital funds for Cancer Research UK, a disease close to her heart. This campaign is deeply personal; in July 2024, just before she filmed The Traitors, Sophie Jones, Leanne’s fiancée was diagnosed with grade three breast cancer. Through every step of Sophie’s treatment, Leanne stood by her side, and now, after Sophie’s all-clear in January, the couple are celebrating with a wedding on the horizon. The former soldier and mum to two-year-old twin boys discusses parenting, her Race for Life challenge, the impact of cancer on her family, her time on The Traitors, and her plans for the future!
