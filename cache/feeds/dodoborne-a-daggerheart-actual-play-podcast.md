      "description": "Dearest Gentle Reader, The town is abuzz with news of the misdeeds of the younger Zesthon son. Such an embarrassment to be cavorting with grave dirt, announcing unsightly names and foulest language. Certainly his father will not approve of such behavior. This author, however, is quite fascinated with the trio of new adventurers who saved the young lord. Strolled in from the tragedy of Brackenroad, much like a few members of the landed gentry who seem to have eyes on the bachelors and bachelorettes who’ve recently entered society. Keep your eyes on these new elements, gentle reader, for I shall be doing the same. Yours Truly, Your GM, Your best friend, Isaac Julia Quinn Jane Austen Burns. Kapi gets back to his roots.

      "description": "Welcome to the Brackenroad Apple Festival! We are so thrilled to have you! Although our Apples are all year round, the festival is the most exciting part of our season! What's so great about apples you ask? The apple has been called the loveliest of all fruits. It is also one of the most important agricultural crops grown in the Algenubi Province, and has been a part of the province's culture and heritage for nearly 250 years. Algenubi is the largest producer of apples in Voldaen, and Brackenroad accounts for 80% of the province's crops. Needless to say, we're crazy about apples, and want to celebrate them with you! Visit our nearly 40 acres of orchards and pick your own apples! Take some seeds and plant your own! Though I can't promise they aren't magic beans; nor can I promise that your apples will be as good as here. The soil is just different here, blessed by Sage itself they say! Visit our many food vendors! Want some fresh milk from a haggard cow named Milky White? Want some bread to give to your poor old granny in the woods? How about some ash-free lentils? All that can be found here! I'll even throw a sticky bun in there for you. Visit our fantastic games. You'll find classics such as Applejacks, Appletoss, Appletiles, and more! We're thrilled to announce the release of a new game this year: Apple Daggerheart! We've got a volunteer with an apple in front of their chest, and we've got a set of three throwing knives here. I'm sure you can figure the rest out. Just launch it as hard as you can! Don't worry, they're wearing armor. See how high of a score you can hit!

(in case you forgot) with another entry about what i did today!! :•) Kapi let me and Crank work together which I think was much needed after the last time we were on a mission together..... :•| Needless to say this went so much better this time. No more squashes hahaha :•D .... :'•( We touched base with Evelyn and Tobias about the idea of them being our eyes and ears on the town. They were scratching their whiskers at first, but with a little extra cheddar (;•D) they came to an a\"brie\"ment (;•DD) that was \"Gouda\" (;•DDD) for everyone involved. We dropped in on C- Mom who changed her name again. I feel like she expects everyone to know her only as \"librarian\" so she uses that to mess with people. This time it was Rosette, last time it was Roseanne? What's it gonna be tomorrow? :•O I can wait to find out! :•D We found out a LOT MORE about peoples types than I was expecting. :•S I wonder if C-Mom would be interested in Cyrus since she likes beards so much? :•/ Anyway!!!!! :•$ Can't wait to write you tomorrow!! :•D Love, Pistachio DodoBorne is a comedy storytelling actual play podcast where four friends dive into the world of Daggerheart, a brand-new tabletop roleplaying game by Darrington Press.

I look in the town, and this whole place is Azh! So I say to myself, \"I gotta find this guy! I gotta go up to his office and put an apple in the guy's gods darn hands! Otherwise, he's never going to get it and he's going to keep coming back down here.\" So I go up to Azh’s office and what do I find out, Pistachio? What do I find out?! There is no Azh. The man does not exist, okay? So I decide, \"Oh shoot, buddy, I gotta dig a little deeper.\" There's no Azh? You gotta be kidding me! I got boxes full of Azh! All right. So I start marchin' my way down to Roseanne in the library and I knock on her door and I say, \"Roseanne! Roseanne! I gotta talk to you about Azh.\" And when I open the door what do I find? There's not a single desk in that office! There...is...no...Roseanne in the Library. Crank, half the people in this town have been made up. This town is a gods dang ghost town.
