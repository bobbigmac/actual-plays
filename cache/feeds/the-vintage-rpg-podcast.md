Unlike most Games Omnivorous game products, which hew towards the OSR, The Job veers into more narrative territory, drawing inspiration from games like Apocalypse World and Dread . The result is a fast-paced, light-weight storytelling game with enough mechanical tooth to satisfy OSR-type players.

And, best of all, it is full of decisions that are just absolutely perplexing. A real testament to how easy it is from RPGs to get to the outer reaches of the bizarre. * * * Instagram? Old news.

Just about every mythos threat imaginable lurks in Dove's Bay, which is sort of the way with CoC solos, but the result is still charming and pretty effective.

Tim walks us through the early days of Citadel Miniatures, his rise to prominence at Games Workshop and his role in shaping the various flavors of Warhammer that emerged during his tenure from 1985 to 1991, culminating with Realm of Chaos. We also nearly spin off into a tangential discussion of the Horus Heresy, but luckily we pulled back from tumbling into that abyss.

      "description": "Where does the game end and real life begin? This week on the Vintage RPG Podcast, we look at Gameplayers , Stephen Bowkett's 1986 novel. At first blush, it seems to belong in that silly microgenre of panicky novels dedicated to wondering about how kids can cope with fantasy as powerful as tabletop RPGs (see Mazes & Monsters and Hobgoblin , both 1981). What we get, though, is a coming of age story in which a D&D-like game plays a prominent role in helping the grade-school protagonist deal with the increasing complexities of real life. And not in a corny After School Special way, believe it or not! The kids talk like kids, the game feels like a plausible game and the forays into fantasy are peppered with clever monsters and interesting encounters. * * * Stu's book, Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground is for sale now!

On the other hand, it's by Greg Costikyan ( Star Wars , Paranoia , Violence , Toon ) and because of his work on those games, I feel like it is very much taking the piss.

Not only is this a gorgeous coloring book (with some content of questionable suitability for kids) but it also comes with a rules lite dungeon crawl game baked in, penned by Gygax himself [Note: Stu has since learned that Gygax wrote the storybook portion of the album, but Lawrence \"White Plume Mountain\" Schick designed the game]. We hadn't ever heard of this until a few months ago, but it instantly became one of our favorite Dungeons & Dragons books of all time. Bonus Fact: The map for the game portion is a modified version of the Tower of Zenopus dungeon from John Eric Holmes D&D Basic Set (1979). * * * This episode was supposed to be an interview with our pal Levi Combs, whose latest kickstarter, the John Carpenter-inspired Assault on Witchgate 13 for DCC , is live now.

      "description": "This week on the Vintage RPG Podcast, we look at (and listen to) First Quest: The Music , a double LP record of electronic music and narration for an officially licensed (and totally ridiculous) Dungeons & Dragons adventure printed on the sleeves. Is it a precursor to dungeonsynth? Sort of? Is it a precursor to the 1994 First Quest box set for D&D, which included an audio CD full of mortifying sound cues for the included introductory adventures? Probably? Is it way a better listen than it has any business being? Absolutely, yes. * * * You can listen to the whole album on YouTube . The main source of information on First Quest: The Music is on Blogonomicon . If you scroll down into the comments, you'll find a lengthy one by David Miller, one of the key folks responsible for the creation of the album. 2 Warps to Neptune has some additional information as well. * * * Stu's book, Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground is for sale now!

      "description": "This week on the Vintage RPG Podcast, Momatoes is back to chat with us about her new RPG, The Marvelous Children of Inang-Uri . It's a worldmaking game that spans generations, has a splash of hidden traitor mechanics for flavor and involves a culture living in symbiosis with a gigantic creature/entity that they also call home — that's the world that the players make and that the characters must safeguard (unless they're a traitor, in which case they want Inang-Uri dead). As with ARC, a game that plays with both the idea of looming doom and also the embrace of hope in the face of it. It's gorgeously illustrated and laid out, too! And best of all, its available NOW! * * * Until December 12, 100% of all sales of The Marvelous Children of Inang-Uri will go to Doctors Without Borders . You can follow Momatoes on Twitter or keep up with her projects on her official site . * * * Stu's book, Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground is for sale now! Buy it ! Patreon? Discord?

      "description": "We lost a real legend in Russ Nicholson this year. I can honestly say that Russ and his work sneak into my mind in short order whenever I talk about fantasy art at length, no matter the period. When we recorded this interview back in 2019, it was apparently his first appearance on a podcast, which seems bizarre considering how large his work looms over the hobby, then and now. I'll never not be bummed about a lack of Russ Nicholson in the world. Anyway, we couldn't record last week, so we thought it would be cool to bring this one out from the vault, a little in memoriam for his passing earlier this year. Original Show Notes: This week, we talk to the incomparable artist Russ Nicholson. Russ has created countless iconic illustrations for tabletop RPGs - you probably best know his work from the original Dungeons & Dragons Fiend Folio or from countless fantasy gamebooks, like the Fighting Fantasy series. We chat about his work, his career, Ouija boards, Scottish accents and more in what, as far as Russ can recall, is his first podcast interview ever! A few notes directly from Russ after the fact: \"Sorry about my memory and going off at side tangents so often but I enjoyed that...funny I have never talked in regards to the source of my artwork about the 'happenings' at our old house when I was growing up before. At least as I age, these awarenesses are rare and our present bungalow is so new there is nothing directly 'there.' Now artists - there are a few I especially rate (although I made a point of never copying) - Albrecht Durer, the Brueghals, Rembrandt, El Greco, Hals, Velazquez, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Mucha, Klimt, Toulouse Lautrec, Doré, Beardsley and Rackham, to name a few. Also pulps - Sax Rohmer, Howard, The Shadow, Weird Tales, Black Mask stories, Poe, Edgar Wallace, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Merrit, Hamilton, Jules Verne, Rider Haggard and the old pulp serials I saw at Saturday morning children's cinema - loved it all. From age ten on, when I left the countryside life for life in the city, I read a lot (up until then my mother thought I didn't read anything except comics). And that silent film I was trying to talk about - it had something similar, where a man is sitting by a rock pool (?) and these squidgy tentacled things (similar to the Grell toy Stu sent me) come out of the water and drag him to his doom. Scared me as a lad but I was in my teens so no screaming attacks (laf) and am still not fond.\" * * * Stu's book, Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground is for sale now! Buy it ! Patreon? Discord?

Perhaps in a novel twist on frequency bias, Stu noticed a bunch of books hitting shelves that, like steak and red wine, seem to pair well with his own Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground in a variety of ways. So here we are, chatting about Adam Rowe's Worlds Beyond Time , Astral Eyes' Spell Bound , Aaron A. Reed's 50 Years of Text Games , the two-volume Talking Miniatures from Shaggy Dog Publishing and the truly astounding Arik Roper retrospective, Vision of the Hawk . Call it a holiday gift guide - if you like our work, we bet you'll like theirs! * * * Worlds Beyond Time is available via Barnes & Noble (and Amazon, but ugh). Your best bet for getting Spell Bound is to follow Bibliomancers on Instagram - they regularly post stock and shop links in their stories. The offset printed edition of 50 Years of Text Games is sold out, but you can still get print-on-demand editions . The best bet for Talking Miniatures , in the US at least, is probably Amazon (sign). In the US, you can get Vision of the Hawk through MIT Press . In the UK, buy direct from Strange Attractor . * * * Stu's book, Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground is for sale now! Buy it !

As it turns out, he's working on a third volume of The Abyss of Hallucinations , his RPG setting that merges MÖRK BORG with themes pulled from Crowley's Book of Lies . The first two volumes, as well as a reprint of Book of Lies were produced as gorgeous zines, but the third will be a frankly stunning hardcover that also collects the contents of those first two volumes. How do you get such a beguiling bauble? On Kickstarter, of course, launching on October 31 in partnership with Exalted Funeral.

      "description": "This week on the Vintage RPG Podcast, we're getting into the spooky season a little early with The Dare (2020), a scenario for Call of Cthulhu that pits some costumed kids against a haunted house and the thoroughly horrific witch that lives there. Originally written by Kevin A. Ross as a somewhat legendary tournament module in the late '80s, this modern renovation featuring kid-sized Call of Cthulhu rules brings the game to modern audiences for the first time. It's notable for being one of the very first RPG scenarios to cast players as kids (though it is emphatically not for children) and it will surely be a welcome addition to your Halloween one-shot arsenal. * * * Stu's book, Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground is up for pre-order now!

This Ennie Award-winning zine is the product of over thirty collaborators, including 11 guest writers and 17 artists, who worked together to reimagine the classic D&D cavern crawl B2: Keep on the Borderlands as a BAR crawl. You see, in the centuries since the original adventurer's cleared out the Caves of Chaos, a festival celebrating that achievement — the RAVES of Chaos — came to dominate the town every year. Now the king is sick, a cure is needed and to find it, players must brave the raves and visit the many different pubs of the keep. It's delightful!

This week on the Vintage RPG Podcast, we're talking about Swordthrust (1984), a particularly wild scenario from Mayfair's Role Aids line of D&D supplements. Despite the generic sounding title, this adventure sees players exploring the brain of a hibernating Titan and navigating his dreams made flesh in order to find an artifact of incredible power (sort of). While it is sort of unusually weird for the period, it is also a great example of how a certain amount of \"gonzo\" is baked right in to the standards of the hobby. We also chat a little bit about Role Aids generally, something that will be helpful for folks reading the Instagram feed next year (spoiler: I'm doing posts on ALL the Role Aids books in 2024; get read for lots of Boris). * * * Stu's book, Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground is up for pre-order now!

When we redid the fairly recent Erol Otus interview last time, I made a mental note to stretch further back and pluck our interview with Tony DiTerlizzi out of the mists of time. It remains one of my favorite RPG chats, public or private, and certainly deserves a second moment in the spotlight. Original show notes from June 24, 2019: We have a very special guest this episode: illustrator Tony DiTerlizzi graced us with a full length interview. We chat about his influences, Dragon Mountain , the Monstrous Manual , Planescape , Magic the Gathering, the Spiderwick Chronicles , Hong Kong dinosaurs (you can read Tony's post on these and their influence on Dungeons & Dragons here ) and so much more – and we barely scratch the surface, honestly. * * * Stu's book, Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground is up for pre-order now!

It's still an interesting system, especially considering it corrects OD&D in a lot of similar ways Gygax did with AD&D. It also has a number of mechanical innovations that anticipate systems seen later in RuneQuest and Rolemaster and many other games.

We also talk about Pig-Head from the Yla Eason's Sun-Man toy line, the swine-things from House on the Borderland and door-shaped shields. It's another odd-ball episode! * * * We only scratched the surface here. Of particular further interest, Stu neglected to mention William Blake's diabolical character Orc , who likely also influenced Tolkien in the creation of creatures that wholly embody conceptual evil. Also missing is the demon Orcus, who has interesting folkloric connection here, though we did cover that in a previous podcast episode . And while we discussed some of the ways orcs can be seen as perpetuating racial stereotypes, we totally neglected to talk about how some folks, particularly in queer communities, have reclaimed the orc. Grant Howitt's Big Gay Orcs is a good example of, well, gay orcs. It's right there in the title. * * * Hang out with us on the Vintage RPG Discord !

Even though this was published in 1980, it actually saw play as early as the summer of 1976 at conventions, so as outside the norm as Barrier Peaks may seem, it also shows how early silliness had come to be core to the D&D experience.

      "description": "This week on the Vintage RPG Podcast, we discuss the concept of the West Marches, a style of play for large groups of players and on-demand GMs (mostly intended for D&D and its derivatives). West Marches was developed by Ben Robbins ( Microscope , Kingdom ) and offers a pretty unique framework for RPGs that puts a lot of the onus of play on players rather than GMs, and weaponizes the dread Fear of Missing Out. Stu's starting up a West Marches game for Patrons , so it's been on his mind! * * * There are tons of resources for and musings about West Marches games, but the place to start, if you're interesting, is Robbins' own blogs on the subject . Note: while Stu has personally decided that the \"Marches\" part of the name refers to military walking, and refers to it as such in the episode, a march in this context is actually a kind of borderland. In medieval Europe, these were used as neutral zones between regions, often for military purposes. A whole lot of names and words derive from the concept (including marquis and Denmark), to the extent that once you're aware of it, you see a lot of Europe differently. * * * Hang out with us on the Vintage RPG Discord !

      "description": "This week on the Vintage RPG Podcast, we chat with Michael Monaco about his new book excavating the history of Fantasy Wargaming called The Highest Level of All . The game is a very idiosyncratic RPG created in the late '70s in the UK. I've talked about this game before, both in a previous episode of the podcast and in a post a million years ago — this is one of the RPGs from the early days that's interested in \"realistic\" simulation. It has a reputation for being unplayable (which Mike dispels) and for having silly things like stat blocks for the Virgin Mary. But it is also a deeply intriguing game, partly because it was one of the first to hit shelves in mainstream bookstores, partly because it's primary creator Bruce Galloway died not long after its publication. We try to get to the bottom of Fantasy Wargaming 's unusual, but enduring appeal! * * * Buy the The Highest Level of All , or grab a free PDF from the publisher. You can also check out Mike's blog, Swords & Dorkery for more on Fantasy Wargaming and other RPGs! * * * Our friends at Cadabra Records are excited about their imminent Nightlands Festival.

The winner claimed the defeated card (they have a gold value) and could send it in to \"purchase\" special treasure cards. There are puzzles and quests as well, but the real star is the artist pool, which includes heavy hitters like Iain McCaig and Led Edwards.

At a glance, Maze of Peril doesn't inspire much confidence as to its quality, but it winds up being a fun adventure that captures something of the spirit of the early days of Dungeons & Dragons — something countless other hard-trying fantasy novels have failed to do. * * * New year, new Noble Knight discount code!

We also talk a little bit about RPGs as well — how could we not, as James was behind Hogshead Publishing and their New Style series of RPGs (we're going to have him back to talk at length about The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen , promise). * * * Everybody Wins is in stores on March 14 — pre-order it now on Amazon (and pretty much everywhere else, too). You can also check out the Everybody Wins Podcast . James has a couple other audio/visual projects of interest. Ludonarrative Dissidents , with Greg Stolze and Ross Payton, is a podcast that looks at a different RPG every episode, while Inside the Rookery , is a weekly stream on RPG and storytelling in geek spaces.

Which is also the short-lived Phoenix Games (in like, 1980). It's a little confusing, and we iron that out. The books themselves, though, are an inspiring collection of monsters, demons, skills, magic systems and new character classes, kinda sorta for D&D, but also for other fantasy RPGs of the time. It's a great example of the DIY nature of the hobby that's been with us from the start, and will continue on well into the future.",

Original show notes: Happy holidays, folks! We're breaking from format this episode to dig deep into the nostalgia and look at the Sears Wish Book, an important part of our childhood Christmas experiences. Specifically, we're looking at the catalogs from 1982, 1983 and 1984, which contained, you guessed it, Dungeons & Dragons stuff. They are so much more than that, though, as you'll discover when you listen! And, while we have you, let us offer our tremendous thanks for following Vintage RPG on Instagram, listening to the podcast and making this whole project fun and rewarding on a daily basis. All the best this holiday season!",

We talk about the enduring appeal of this sort of art and speculate a bit about what a book like this said about the broader RPG scene at the time of its publication. * * * A large number of the paintings from Down in the Dungeon can be viewed at the Monster Brains blog . And hey, you know what is awesome? The ownership of Noble Knight has agreed to recognize the union! We're firm believers in the non-controversial idea that all workers should be fairly compensated by their employers.

Within, they discuss… I6: Ravenloft ! Yep, this week on the Vintage RPG Podcast, we're airing a remastered repeat. One of Stu's microphone cables died under mysterious circumstances and we couldn't replace it in time to record a new jam. We'll be back next week with the Halloween episode Stu had been planning, and that's all right, since everyday is Halloween if you want it to be. The original, laborious show notes, featuring now inaccurate timestamps, follow: The guys start off with Ghost Fightin ' Treasure Hunters , a co-op board game about finding treasure in a haunted house (01:33). Stu explains how it reminds him of another co-op game, Flash Point , about fighting fires (03:03). Hambone talks a bit about the games two expansion (04:41). Hambone introduces the main course of our feast, D&D module I6 - Ravenloft (06:23). He declares it the best stand-alone module for D&D, though Stu disagrees (06:42). An unexpected hypothetical interlude about the 1979 cult classic film, The Warriors (08:38). Back on track. Hambone explains how much he loves the idea of a dungeon crawl through Dracula's castle (09:55) and goes ga-ga over the maps (10:28). They discuss how experimental the module was for the time (12:00) and what kind of music Strahd is probably into (13:49). Stu breaks down how important Strahd is in terms of villain design (14:53). Hambone talks about how difficult it is to run Strahd as a master tactician (17:00). Curse of Strahd for 5E comes up (19:20). Stu offers his final thoughts on the module (21:00) and touches on House on Gryphon Hill , the sequel to Ravenloft (22:00). Castlevania: Simon's Quest comes up (24:10) and Bram Stoker's Dracula , too (25:34). Hambone briefly gets excited about Mixtape Massacre (28:00) and the guys say their farewells. * * * Clarification: Let's talk dates. Ravenloft came out in 1983. House on Gryphon Hill came out in 1986. Castlevania came out in Japan in 1986 and North America in '87 while Castlevania II: Simon's Quest came out in Japan in '87 and North America in '88. Judging from the art on the cover of Simon's Quest , it is pretty clear that Ravenloft was at least on the radar of the videogame developers.",

      "description": "Ships and desert islands and sea shanties and secret treasures: we're getting nautical on this week's episode of the Vintage RPG Podcast. First up, N4 — Treasure Hunt (1986), one of the finest introductory scenarios for first edition Dungeons & Dragons. It's one of the only modules to successfully pull of the \"you've been captured and lost all your stuff\" trope and introduces the underloved idea of zero-level characters (at least until Dungeon Crawl Classics came around). Good stuff all around! We also chat with Tristan Zimmerman about his unusual nautical RPG, Shanty Hunters , in which you attempt to preserve sea shanties that magically defend themselves by manifesting the subjects of their songs to stop you. It's pretty wild and on Kickstarter right now ! * * * Be sure to check out Tristan's Ennie-nominated RPG blog, Molten Sulphur .",

For the last few years, we've reserved this week to chat about Ravenloft, but this year we thought we'd talk about a game that seems truer to the spirit of the season: Babes in the Wood , from World Champ Game Company. It's a delightfully spooky game about being a child lost in the woods on an endless Halloween. What could be better? But that's not all! Comic writer Mark Sable is back for a chat, this time to tell us about his new comic, Chaotic Neutral , which ponders the question: what if Dungeons & Dragons was everything the Satanic Panic thought it was?

It instantly takes its places as one of the definitive RPG takes on Robert W. Chambers' infamous King in Yellow, delivering an unprecedented, mind-bending experience — and that's just reading the book. Playing the campaign is likely something the folks at your table will never forget. A solid gold modern classic. Stu doesn't generally care about spoilers but in this case tried to minimize discussing them. Still, if you're planning on playing this, or think you might down the line, maybe be ready to stick your fingers in your ears while listening. We've also got a new Indie Elevator Pitch! Sadia Bies and Banana Chan pop on to chat about their anthology of live action horror RPGs that tackle themes of suburbia, food and consumption. Coming to Kickstarter soon !",

We honestly barely scratch the surface, though, talking more about the edginess of the 90s, the trend of investigating secret histories in RPGs and all that pre-millennial tension that was in the air. We'll be taking another, closer look at Kult down the line for sure.",

On this week's Vintage RPG Podcast, we reveal the shocking true story behind Deities & Demigods and the removal of the Cthulhu and Melnibonean mythologies. Actually, we don't, because it was never a big secret and most of the details have been floating around the internet for decades, but there are lots of misconceptions about this book and its history and it seemed like we should do our part in helping to clear them up. The truth isn't scandalous at all but, ultimately, it's probably more interesting!",

More interesting, All the Worlds' Monsters is sort of the first step in a long legacy of collaboration in the RPG industry on Chaosium's part, so we talk about that a bit too.

      "description": "A few weeks back, we talked about the Pagan Publishing Delta Green sourcebooks for Call of Cthulhu . This week on the Vintage RPG Podcast, we're chatting about the standalone Delta Green RPG from Arc Dream (2016). Based on Call of Cthulhu sixth edition, the game makes some key modification to the sanity system. It also finds ways to reinvent the mythos while keeping the focus of the horror human — in a lot of ways, Delta Green is about alienation and trauma. Mulder and Scully this is not. Clarification: In the episode, Stu mentions that Delta Green is based on Call of Cthulhu 6th Edition. That's not accurate! While the underlying mechanics are inspired by that game, Delta Green's system stands alone and features several unique additions, including Bonds (mentioned in the episode) and Lethality. Arc Dream and Delta Green are completely independent from Chaosium and Call of Cthulhu .",

In the days before the internet and searchable digital databases, the fact that this exists (and missed just one magic item) is astonishing.

I pointed the bullhorn in the general direction of Hambone's house and shouted very loudly into it. Meanwhile, Hambone had to scurry around with an ill-fitting baseball mitt in order to catch each individual word as it flew through the air. Once caught, he deposited the words into a disused aquarium for safekeeping until they could be reconstructed at a later time. The real amazing thing about this is that Hambone only had a vaguest idea of what I was saying and I had simply no clue what he was saying, but somehow, the episodes of the podcast came together as if we were sitting in the same room having a normal conversation. Oh, yea, this week's episode is about The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1998), a storytelling game about tall tales.

We talk about the appeal of being the monster, the many similarities between the two games and the delightful way in which Nightlife captures the nightlife of New York City in the early 90s. Content warning, though: around the six minute mark, we have a brief and frank discussion about some casual racism in the game that includes some harsh language.",

Halfway through the massive colony ship's journey, it passed through a cloud of radiation, leading to waves of mutation and a breakdown of society. Now, centuries later, the human population of the ship have lost the knowledge of how to use the ship's technology, heck, they don't even know they're on a ship in space! Explore the world, crawl through the engineering ducts and try to avoid the man-eating plants! * * * Noble Knight is back with a new discount code for our lovely listeners.

It is all caps GREAT, brimming with personality, overflowing with whimsy and drowning in ideas. Bill Spytma's art, which merges aesthetics of medieval art with those of the Victorian era, is delightful and goes a long way to making everything feel cohesive. A huge, vibrant and exciting accomplishment. Zines are the future, folks.",

One of the earliest RPGs, it is another example of D&D players feeling like D&D failed in some way and making their own game to correct it. In C&S 's case, Ed Simbalist and Wilf Backhaus felt D&D wasn't realistic enough, so they set about making a game that reaaaaally leans into simulation and is pretty tedious, even for its time. However! They also created not one, but three extremely detailed campaign settings, which no one was really doing at the time. We take a look at those, too. One has dinosaurs! Very realistic!",

There is poetry. There is clip art. There are so many charts. Most importantly, the creation of World Action and Adventure scored author Gregory L. Kinney (right) credit for five college courses! Easily one of the oddest RPGs we've ever encountered.",

Based on the Fafhrd and Gray Mouser stories by Fritz Leiber, Lankhmar is both a city and a larger campaign setting for Dungeons & Dragons (using a modified character creation system) that captures the atmosphere of the original stories. The real genius of the book is the approach to the city, which uses modular geomorphs for the tangled and ever-changing back alleys. We also talk a bit about Leiber, his Lankhmar co-creator Otto Fischer and the stories themselves, which form one of the biggest influences on early Dungeons & Dragons.",

Designed by Ken St. Andre, Stormbringer is a high power and high risk RPG set in the world of Michael Moorcock's Elric stories (for our money, perhaps the greatest fantasy series ever written). One of the more straightforward of the games using Chaosium's Basic Role Playing system, it has piles of fatalistic atmosphere and dark themes, perhaps most notably the magic system that relies on mind altering substances and is entirely arranged around summoning and binding demons and other supernatural entities. Most Stormbringer games end in death or corruption – the fun is in figuring out which is the better fate.",

Perhaps most importantly, it introduces a terrifying take on the troll that Gygax would essentially Xerox for the game. Interesting stuff!",

First, of course, is the Todd Lockwood illustration of Orcus from Dragon Magazine 42 (October, 1980). Second, Stu couldn't quite fish the name of this engraving out of his brain in the episode, but \"Satan Presiding at the Infernal Council,\" by John Martin (circa 1823) is the piece whose vibe reminds him of Lockwood's Orcus. Finally, here is the \"Orcus Mouth\" in the Gardens of Bomarzo, or the Park of Monsters. * * *",

Designed by Ken St. Andre ( Stormbringer ), T&T was developed as a simpler, less expensive alternative to D&D, with a focus on solo play (solo T&T modules were the first adventure gamebooks, paving the way for series like Fighting Fantasy and Lone Wolf). Back in the day, folks said T&T was too simple to have much staying power, but the game is still with us and is an important first step towards modern attempts at streamlined rules systems.",

Aimed at children, they were an immediate success. In 1983, they followed up with HeartQuest, which introduced romance into the formula and courted women readers. It was a dismal failure. Why?

They watched the 1982 made-for-TV movie Mazes and Monsters , based on the Rona Jaffe novel of the same name, which is based loosely and idiotically on the totally not related to Dungeons & Dragons disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III in 1979. It is notable for being Tom Hanks' first major role, a shockingly poor understanding of RPGs, some atrocious one-liners and a decent lizard man suit. Some movies are so bad they're a blast to watch. Mazes and Monsters isn't one of them. Buckle up and get ready to feel our pain.",

Slavicsek's recounting of the bidding war around the Star Wars license leads me to believe that TSR shuttered the Star Frontiers line in anticipation of developing a Star Wars RPG. That's a gut feeling, though. You should read his book (which is EXCELLENT) and decide for yourself!",

It is a clear source for the drow, the duergar and the game's preoccupation with vast underground labyrinths, but that's just scratching the surface…",

Russ has created countless iconic illustrations for tabletop RPGs – you probably best know his work from the original Dungeons & Dragons Fiend Folio or from countless fantasy gamebooks, like the Fighting Fantasy series. We chat about his work, his career, Ouija boards, Scottish accents and more in what, as far as Russ can recall, is his first podcast interview ever! * * * A few notes directly from Russ after the fact: \"Sorry about my memory and going off at side tangents so often but I enjoyed that…funny I have never talked in regards to the source of my artwork about the 'happenings' at our old house when I was growing up before. At least as I age, these awarenesses are rare and our present bungalow is so new there is nothing directly 'there.' Now artists – there are a few I especially rate (although I made a point of never copying) – Albrecht Durer, the Brueghals, Rembrandt, El Greco, Hals, Velazquez, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, Mucha, Klimt, Toulouse Lautrec, Doré, Beardsley and Rackham, to name a few. Also pulps – Sax Rohmer, Howard, The Shadow, Weird Tales, Black Mask stories, Poe, Edgar Wallace, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Merrit, Hamilton, Jules Verne, Rider Haggard and the old pulp serials I saw at Saturday morning children's cinema – loved it all. From age ten on, when I left the countryside life for life in the city, I read a lot (up until then my mother thought I didn't read anything except comics). And that silent film I was trying to talk about – it had something similar, where a man is sitting by a rock pool (?) and these squidgy tentacled things (similar to the Grell toy Stu sent me) come out of the water and drag him to his doom. Scared me as a lad but I was in my teens so no screaming attacks (laf) and am still not fond.\" * * * You can see scads of Russ' art on his blog, The Gallery .",

The main course is Forgotten Realms , Ed Greenwood's classic campaign setting. We walk through the creation of the world, its absorption into Dungeons & Dragons and just barely scratch the surface of all the stuff that has happened with the Realms over the years. The Realms are huge, so we'll be visiting them again, no doubt. We wrap things up with a look at Things From the Flood , the follow-up to Tales From the Loop , the RPG about the 80s that never existed. Flood moves things up to the 90s and now your kid characters can die, because the 90s are gritty!",

We also have a chat with Levi Combs of Planet X games.

Did you know there was an unofficial 1.5 edition of Dungeons & Dragons? There was! Beginning with Unearthed Arcana and following through Oriental Adventures , Dungeoneer's Survival Guide and the Wilderness Survival Guide , it was partly a natural evolution of the system, partly a desperate attempt to save the company from financial ruin. Stu walks us through the history. Finally, we started playing Pendragon and we chat about character creation and the first introductory session. (Stu never explicitly states it, but the tedious bit was not the character creation itself, but rather working through the family histories).",

Second, Hambone is a-glow for the new Dungeons & Dragons adventure compilation, Ghosts of Saltmarsh , which reprints a number of classic D&D scenarios, including the U-series: Sinister Secret of Salt Marsh , Danger at Dunwater and The Final Enemy . Surprising no one, Stu is less enthusiastic. Don't let that grump stop you, though. Ghosts of Saltmarsh is for sale now at our sponsor, Noble Knight Games .

      "description": "This week, we're playing Heimlich & Co. , a modern issue of a clever espionage-themed game originally from 1984 (you may know it as Top Secret Spies , Under Cover or Detective & Co. ). Over on our Patreon, folks who back us at the $25 level get to call the shots for an episode. This week, Sara Clemens asked us to cover Mouse Guard , Burning Wheel's RPG adaptation of David Petersen's beautiful comic series. Over the holiday break, we made some characters and ran the game so we could give you our impressions. It is pretty cool! We wrap things up discussing Stu's recent experience setting up a Blades in the Dark game on Roll20.",

Stu takes the helm and starts us down Stafford's tabletop RPG history with the wargame White Bear & Red Moon (also known as Dragon Pass). From there, he touches on RuneQuest, the Ghostbusters RPG, the entire world of Glorantha, HeroQuest and Pendragon, all the while trying to convey how widely Stafford's work influenced the hobby. We'll be covering most of these games in more depth on the Instagram feed this week, so look for that.",

We're breaking from format this episode to dig deep into the nostalgia and look at the Sears Wish Book, an important part of our childhood Christmas experiences. Specifically, we're looking at the catalogs from 1982, 1983 and 1984, which contained, you guessed it, Dungeons & Dragons stuff. They are so much more than that, though, as you'll discover when you listen! And, while we have you, let us offer our tremendous thanks for following Vintage RPG on Instagram, listening to the podcast and making this whole project fun and rewarding on a daily basis. All the best this holiday season!",

The main event: Dragon Magazine (05:38). Stu gives a brief history of the publication (06:00). Hambone remembers seeing it in book stores in the mall (07:45). Stu reveals how Dragon Magazine gave him the collecting bug (09:41) and how his large run functions as a sort of history of the tabletop RPG hobby (11:00). Stu talks about how editor Tim Kask worked to keep Dragon semi-independent from TSR (13:00). Editor Roger E. Moore's tenure comes up (13:54) along with Dungeon Magazine. While Dragon slowly became an advertorial publication, Stu doesn't mind because it allows us to see D&D evolving on a month to month basis (15:00) and Hambone segues into the Dragon+ . Stu gets into Dragon's experimental tendencies (17:30) and explains how Forgotten Realms was (kinda sorta) born in the magazine (19:22). Preservation comes up (21:00). A brief encouragement to subscribe to Unwinnable Monthly during our Holiday Subscription Drive (24:25). Stu gets excited about completing his Planescape collection (25:00). See you in two weeks! * Clarification: Stu meant Rubbermaid, not Tupperware Correction: Despite his whip-fast certainty, Stu was wrong. Pong came out in 1972.",

      "description": "In this episode, we break format to give you some gifts suggestions of the holidays – whether you give them to your favorite tabletop playing pal or add them to your Christmas lists is entirely up to you. First up, the Dragon Heist platinum edition (02:15). We chat about dice (07:00). Artisan makes very nice dice. We talk about Wormwood dice vaults and accessories (09.00). Stu laments that he didn't own the Masks of Nyarlathotep prop set from the H.P. Lovecraft Historical Society. It comes in two flavors, regular and holy crap that is expensive (09:45). Art & Arcana inevitably comes up (13:50). Both the regular edition and the limited edition are on sale on Amazon. You can read more of Stu's thoughts on the regular edition and the limited edition on the Insta. Hambone suggests the D&D 5E conversion of X1- The Isle of Dread from Goodman Games (17:38). We thought this one would be out in time for the holidays, but alas, it's hitting shelves in January. You can pre-order it now, though and put a picture of the cover in a card or something. Or you could nab them Into the Borderlands . We wanted to plug the webstores of World Champ Game Co. and Bodie , but both their webstores are closed right now. Instead, why don't you throw them a couple bucks on their Patreons: you'll get some cool stuff every month (19:20). Hambone hits a couple quick gift suggestions (19:50) like Ghost Fightin' Treasure Hunters and SRG Super Show Finally, every year, Hambone's mom buys his a pound-o-dice from Chessex for Christmas, and that is pretty cool. See you in two weeks! * Correction: The singular of dice is die.",

Stu explains how it reminds him of another co-op game, Flash Point , about fighting fires (03:03). Hambone talks a bit about the games two expansion (04:41). Hambone introduces the main course of our feast, D&D module I6 - Ravenloft (06:23). He declares it the best stand-alone module for D&D, though Stu disagrees (06:42). An unexpected hypothetical interlude about the 1979 cult classic film, The Warriors (08:38). Back on track. Hambone explains how much he loves the idea of a dungeon crawl through Dracula's castle (09:55) and goes ga-ga over the maps (10:28). They discuss how experimental the module was for the time (12:00) and what kind of music Strahd is probably into (13:49). Stu breaks down how important Strahd is in terms of villain design (14:53). Hambone talks about how difficult it is to run Strahd as a master tactician (17:00). Curse of Strahd for 5E comes up (19:20). Stu offers his final thoughts on the module (21:00) and touches on House on Gryphon Hill , the sequel to Ravenloft (22:00). Castlevania: Simon's Quest comes up (24:10) and Bram Stoker's Dracula, too (25:34). Hambone briefly gets excited about Mixtape Massacre (28:00) and the guys say their farewells. * Clarification: Let's talk dates. Ravenloft came out in 1983. House on Gryphon Hill came out in 1986. Castlevania came out in Japan in 1986 and North America in '87 while Castlevania II: Simon's Quest came out in Japan in '87 and North America in '88. Judging from the art on the cover of Simon's Quest , it is pretty clear that Ravenloft was at least on the radar of the videogame developers.",

They discuss the stupidity of group decision making (03:00) and where to get it (05:00). Conversation turns to the main event: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Other Strangeness (05:39). Stu admits to not being a TMNT fan (05:54) and Hambone sketches out the basic history of the franchise (06:20). Stu talks about the (07:09) original TMNT comic book series, which Palladium Books licensed almost immediately for an RPG (07:53). Stu recounts how Palladium's license of Robotech led to the development of the TMNT cartoon and, ironically, the downfall of the TMNT RPG line (08:43). Stu talks a bit about the (complicated) TMNT RPG system, which is a component of Palladium's Megaversal house system (10:55). He falls into the trap of trying to explain the Megaversal system and eventually gets to TMNT 's juicy center: the mutation rules and the After the Bomb campaign setting. (14:40). The guys talk about the rarity of the book (15:53), in particular the very first edition of TMNT and Other Strangeness that contained controversial mental illness rules (16:13). Cowabunga. Hambone gets excited about Pocket Dungeon Quest (17:20) and he walks through its charms (cloth map!)(17:45) See ya next time! (21:22) * Clarification: We tend to use \" Choose Your Own Adventure \" as a catch-all term for pick-your-path game books but, like iPods and Kleenex, that's actually a brand name for the series published by Bantam Books in the 80s and 90s. The Marvel and Dungeons & Dragons gamebooks Hambone mentions were published by TSR (the latter known as the Endless Quest series). Correction: Stu is totally wrong, TMNT did not start off as a Daredevil pitch, it was a conscious parody of Daredevil (and also Ronin , Cerebus and New Mutants , apparently) from the get-go.",

Stu briefly explains how the game works (01:45) and Hambone describes how they play it at their annual New Year's party (02:20). Stu runs down the different roles that alter the game (03:11). Stu touches on the game's negative reputation (03:43) and the guys discuss why it is a handy thing to have in your game arsenal (04:20). Planescape ! Stu explains the initial aesthetic appeal of the campaign setting (05:25) and the basics of what it contains and how it works (06:10). The pronunciation of Sigil comes up (06:50). The Lady of Pain (07:35) and the factions (08:00) come up. In Planescape , ideas can change the multiverse (08:34). Hambone explains his first impression of Planescape (08:48) in the context of a larger on-going campaign. Stu talks about how his Planescape campaigns were his first real ongoing RPG campaigns (09:32) and why it works better than most D&D 2E campaign settings (10:08). Which isn't to say there isn't an Achilles Heel: while all the Planescape material is generally very good, there just isn't enough of it (11:31). The biggest problem is the metastory, which eventually wraps up (in Faction War ) with an unappealing and unsupported shift in the setting's status quo (12:00). Discussion briefly turns to Planescape 's origins in Jeff Grubb's Manual of the Planes and how the party in Stu's game dealt with an Astral Dreadnought (13:30). Hambone gives his impression of the setting from the perspective of a DM running mostly introductory games (14:49) and Stu poo-poos D&D 5E (15:18) The guys nearly forget to mention one of the most important things about Planescape : Tony DiTerlizzi 's art (15:32). Stu waxes ecstatic and talks a bit on how Planescape 's aesthetic was developed (16:00). Final thoughts on Planescape collecting (17:21). (Note: we'll be coming back around to Planescape in future episodes) Wrapping things up, Grant Howitt comes up again (see our previous episode on Masks of Nyarlathotep for more about his RPG Spire: The City Must Fall ) with his hilarious one-page RPGs (18:29). See ya in two weeks (21:54)! * Correction: We call it Werewolf , but the Asmodee's version (which we use) is called The Werewolves of Miller 's Hollow , and it retails for $13. Correction: Original Planescape material tends to be expensive and several later Planescape publications can be routinely found on the second hand market for astronomical prices ( The Great Modron March , Dead Gods , The Inner Planes , Faction War and The Blood War box set). While Stu characterizes them as impossible to find at a reasonable price, he finally did – though it took like 20 years to do it. If you want them cheap sooner than that, grab them from DriveThruRPG as PDF or print-on-demand. Correction: The one-year collection of Grant's one-page RPGs (13 games) is $30.",

Stu talks about a nifty two-player card game called The Blood of an Englishman , based on the fairy tale of Jack the Giant Killer (02:22) and admits the cover art sold him. It's a little bit like head-to-head solitaire (03:04) mixed with chess (04:00). The guys discuss the pleasures of small games that are quick to play (04:40). On to the main event: Masks of Nyarlathotep (05:25). Stu breaks down some of the huge scope of the Call of Cthulhu campaign (05:46) and gives a rundown of what the scenario is about and its place in RPG history (06:34). He reveals the He-Man connection (07:10). They discusses how big and complicated a game it is (08:29). Stu gives a bit of background on how he set up the campaign with other Call of Cthulhu scenarios (09:50) and the guys discuss one of Hambone's awful character deaths (11:00). Stu segues to discuss Chaosium's expanded re-release of Masks of Nyarlathotep for the 7th edition rules (11:30) and talk turns to the fan-made Masks of Nyarlathotep Companion (11:53) and a Gen-Con adventure to secure a copy of it. Stu wonders what a Masks campaign would be like if Jackson Elias doesn't die in the beginning (14:54) and Hambone asks if Stu could run the new version for the same group and not have it be boring and predictable (15:30). Hambone wonders how much experience someone needs to run the campaign (18:22). Stu moves on to talk about Spire: The City Must Fall , by Grant Howitt and Christopher Taylor, a game that reimagines drow as revolutionaries fighting to destroy the oppressive government that rules them (23:48). He loves it. Go buy it. See ya in two weeks (26:23)! * The scenarios Stu ran in the run-up to Masks were: \"Tatterdemalion\" (from Fatal Experiments ), \"The Haunting\" (from the Call of Cthulhu 6th edition rule book), \"Watcher in the Valley\" (from Tales of the Miskatonic Valley), \"The Gods of Mitnal\" (from The Masks of Nyarlathotep Companion ) and \"Dead Man's Stomp\" (from the Call of Cthulhu 6th edition rule book). Stu mentioned some D&D campaigns that might prepare a game master for running something on the scale of Masks of Nyarlathotep . Off the top of his head: Night Below , Return to the Tomb of Horrors and the two part Planescape campaign contained in The Great Modron March and Dead Gods . These are all large scale stories that require a fair amount of NPC and mystery management that reward non-violent approaches to varying degrees. Still, none of them require quite the amount of clue-keeping as Masks . * Clarification: Boss Monster is for 2-4 players. Clarification: There is no right or wrong way to pronounce Nyarlathotep or any other made up fantasy/horror name. However you want to pronounce it, that's the right way. If you want to really break it down, Nyarlathotep is probably \"correctly\" pronounced Nee-Ar-Lat-Ho-Tep, with a hard \"t\" and a distinct \"h,\" not a soft \"th.\" But you do you.",

      "description": "Hambone kicks things off with a quick introduction (00:17). The guys get right to it and talk about a programing board game called Colt Express that they played the previous night (01:20). The focus of the episode is West End Games' Star Wars RPG (06:08). Discussion starts with how completely Star Wars has penetrated popular culture (06:12) and Hambone gives a quick history of the game (06:48). Stu breaks explains how the RPG kept Star Wars alive. (07:40). The Ewok Movie comes up (08:20). Stu theorizes that the initial appeal of the Star Wars RPG laid in the fact that the books gave you access to more material from the movies (09:28). Stu explains the basics of the system (10:31) and explains how the game gave birth to the Expanded Universe (11:13). Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy comes up (11:53) and Stu explains how those books paved the way to the larger Star Wars' modern pop culture explosion (12:37). The Science Fiction Book Club comes up (13:22). Hambone runs through some of the publications dates and cover art for the various editions of the rules (13:50) and Stu voices his disappointment in the design and illustration in the third edition (14:18). Conversation turns to the game's approach to universe building (15:00). They discuss adventure modules, the Kathol Rift campaign (16:38) and the Galaxy Guides, which brings the guys to the topic of toys (17:27) and the joy of weird aliens. There is the inevitable comparison to Star Trek (19:57) and that segues to a quick chat about angry Star Wars fans (20:54) and inclusivity (23:43). Stu talks about his up and down relationship with Star Wars (25:00). Hambone shifts the gears out of the heavy stuff to talk about how the game handles Jedi (26:30) and a digression into miniature play wraps things up (28:00). Finally, we end on a happy note, as Hambone is excited that his copy of the Big Trouble in Little China board game finally arrived (29:00) The guys say their good-byes (31:13). * Correction: Stu has a tick and keeps calling it the Star Wars Extended Universe. While that word usage isn't wrong, the moniker is actually the Star Wars Expanded Universe.",

The main discussion starts (07:50) with Stu explaining why he loves Call of Cthulhu and fawns over the greatness of Chaosium.

Stu breaks down the differences between the different editions of the game (19:00). Stu also talks about Gene Day, the late comic artist who illustrated the first edition Cthulhu box (22:04).
