Should we be worried, or is this just nature’s way of redecorating the Outback? 📚 Online News: Wikipedia turns out to be even stranger than you remember — and possibly more reliable than your uncle’s Facebook feed. 🥔 Bugle Hot Potato: Producer Chris Skinner finally reveals the results of our first-ever Bugle audience survey, and the findings are… troubling, hilarious, and statistically unsound. 🎉 It’s been 18 years of world events, weird news, and questionable analysis — and somehow we’re still here. 🎧 Support The Bugle!

      "description": "🎧 Support The Bugle! Get bonus shows, exclusive video episodes, and smug warmth at thebuglepodcast.com This week, Andy Zaltzman leads an international panel of Buglers through the chaos of politics, wildlife, and billionaire bromances—with a special focus on honey badgers, New Zealand’s political drama, and the heartbreaking (or not?) Musk/Trump split. Andy, Felicity Ward and James Nokise dig in to... 🦡 Honey badgers are fearless, chaotic, and possibly the spiritual animal of this podcast. We investigate their weird mythology and even weirder attitude. 🇳🇿 New Zealand politics is heating up—by Kiwi standards, at least. We delve into coalition collapses, policy oddities, and why it’s all oddly polite. 💔 Elon Musk and Donald Trump: the bromance is off. What happened? Who kept the merch? And can either of them survive without the other’s echo? ⚠️ Warning: This episode contains BS. You’ve been warned. 📺 Watch Realms Unknown, now fully visualised on YouTube. Produced by Chris Skinner and Laura Turner. Possibly supervised by a honey badger. Hosted on Acast. See acast.com/privacy for more information.",
