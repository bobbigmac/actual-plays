Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the marvelous and very multi-faceted gem JOSH HOROWITZ ! Josh has been putting in a huge amount of work over the years primarily in the world of the more public facing celebrity, be it in Q&A form, red carpet, podcast or any other formation you can think of. Well now the tables have officially turned, and Brett hosts Josh in this awesome and immensely fun catch up. We get to hear about all sorts including his own writing process, being a fan first at all times, inventive phonecall impersonations at a young age, death as a catalyst for going in on films, when horrors win, pushing sad or scared buttons, and some unlikely Superbob inspiration gets unlocked too!

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the absolute treasure of a comic, podcaster, film maker/producer and all round force for good TIG NOTARO ! There are so many points at which you might have become aware (and consequently, surely, a fan) of Tig, from her early days in comedy right up to recent times as actor and film-maker. Wherever that point was for you, how lucky we all are to have Tig in our lives. In what is a truly beautiful, emotional episode (with a joyful sprinkling of funny), we hear about the journey and experience of the making of ' Come See Me In The Good Light ' which celebrates the life of poet and activist Andrea Gibson. As with Tig and indeed Brett, it's highly likely that you too will feel the emotion hit - but stay with it and engage with it. And of course if you haven't yet, do watch the movie, as a whole or in chapters. Otherwise, there's a huge amount of fun (oh, including being viral-sexy), and some truly choice picks from Tig so enjoy, cry, smile, do it all.

The RESURRECTION ! It is rare on a resurection episode to feature a guest whose life itself features a resurrection of sorts, but nevertheless, here is where we find Matt Forde this time... You will hear all about it (and by way of trigger / sensitivity warning, there is some cancer talk and health conversation just so you are aware), but of course as with any guest on here, any such matters are handled with care and humour and you know how things go on here - it's all love and safety so just know that going in. But for real, this is a genuinely fun and very funny episode, containing so many goodies and gems throughout, including how Matt became friends with Brick Top off Snatch!

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with a hero of UK comic writing and creator of universes DOUG NAYLOR ! Doug is a hugely important piece of the UK's comic series puzzle, having co-created the iconic sci-fi comedy series Red Dwarf which was a mainstay of primetime viewing. It also made superstars of the cast who were all awesome in their own right. Doug's been involved in a lot of subsequent (and preceding) projects of course, including his book 'Sinbin Island' (aimed at the child readers among us). This is a lovely one with Brett and Doug, covering all sorts including the generation of new material so often, being an author, a potential \"anti-dying on stage device\" which can be applied to life itself, hidden and visible romance in Red Dwarf, his own personal 'bit of a nuisance' and how wearing gloves can be an early signifier of future writing adventures.

Whatever the case - hopefully by now you will have caught at least some of the work generated by these two, as it is a rare thing to have such an insanely great body of work displaying such consistency. A triple-voice dream of an episode which will be sheer indulgence for all movie loving folk, and if you are yet unacquainted with John and Craig, you're about to make some good friends here and hopefully investigate their work after listening...

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the horror movie making phenomenon OSGOOD PERKINS ! For those who don't routinely venture down the path of modern horror, Osgood might be a fixture of the moviemaking world with whom you're yet to become acquainted. Consider this a formal introduction - and for those who've seen his stuff, welcome back! Coming from a very well known parental lineage, Osgood has carved a niche in the horror world transcending the basic facts of who his parents are and planting a flag in a genre which has only been gathering steam and fans in recent years. And while this a calm, collected and sober episode, it's a riveting one offering wisdom, existential nuggets (did you see them back in '74 at the Troubadour? hell of a show), and a huge amount of delightful cinema treats to devour. Catch up on his films if you're in the slightest bit intrigued but otherwise, just enjoy a very satisfying catchup with these two.

Joanna's portfolio is truly inspiring and just a cursory glance at her IMDB page will take a good minute or two. This is a wonderful walk down not only memory lane but also the many planes of the present, as we hear about so much of Joanna's adventurous path and how one door opened to another (intercut with a whole batch of massively diverse movies also, of course). As well as that, we get to know more about the hinge of comedy and drama, acting technique and essentially being prescribed acting, chemistry and inverse chemistry, not being an ironist, dogs and horses, generational war trauma by proxy, the base sauces of cinema, and those rough 80's vibes.

It's nothing but joy from the first moment, but she and Brett also get into a ton of bits and pieces including leaving Saturday Night Live, the desire of a return to acting (villains specifcally), doing a bunch of standup, being a night owl kid, Ghostbusters, Shirley Temple, bad knees as an aphrodisiac and on top of all that, a RED HOT new film pitch or two from them both.

      "description": "LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! A REWIND CLASSIC! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe (again) with movie critic, writer, journalist and presenter MARK KERMODE ! The RESURRECTION ! Mark is always welcome on the podcast, and this Resurrection was a lovely return visit back in the days of 2022. So much life has happened in the interviening years, and also in listening back and giving it a little brush and polish, it became clear that some items may need a little explaining for newer listeners. So here's a quick list of things that might benefit some addressing: • Mark's current podcast is a movie (and film-adjacent TV) review show he co-hosts with Simon Mayo called 'Take', available in free with ads (1 weekly ep) / subscribe for a fee with no ads (2 weekly eps) models. • Referring to someone \"Getting off their bike\" about something, basically means ranting. • This was recorded before the White Lotus with Jason Isaacs in, and he gets a mention, but Mark went to school with him and he's a friend of all things Kermode podcast related. • The 'Linda' he makes reference to is his wife, Professor Linda Ruth Williams. • Up top he references 'Benjamin' and Simon Amstell. Mark had a brief cameo in the film Benjamin, directed by comic, host and writer Simon Amstell. Otherwise, we hear about Mark's ever-growing love for his family, the mechanics of rewatching films, the idea of writing being like a 'journal of record', the niceness of horror film folks (even Leatherface) and making films with love, and so much more awesome behind the scenes movie goodies. Very, very much worthy of your time even if you listened first time round, there's so much to catch that may have been missed first time. Oh and Jeremy is a really sweet film, which you'll have to acquaints yourself with if you want to be his friend (to quote the Spice Girls classic). Zig a zig ahh.

So, so much to get into as Adjani brings us up to speed on such matters as the genesis of the series and creating a student film, shattered illusions of how to get ahead in the business, film festival hookups, running storylines by the family (or not), reverse nepotism, Will Smith vs pre-teens, old films riddled with all the \"-ists\" and \"-ics\", therapy time for young Adjani via Brett, and the utterly beautiful two syllable term that describes itself - \"dry sad\".

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the truly fabulous actor and co-star of 'All Of You', IMOGEN POOTS ! In good time for the release of All Of You, Imogen joins Brett for a rare in-person episode which is a true joy to behold. Of course we get to hear about the process of getting said film up and off the ground including her casting and initial meetings and so on, but there's also the business of Imogen working with a huge amount of heavyweight greats, the joys and perils of flying, how to make Kristen Stewart laugh, swimming and drawing (but with balance), and being a child actor. That's just skimming the surface, as there's tons more going on but it's a genuinely lovely one so enjoy this lovely catch up with Imogen! Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon!

A lovely meetup with Brett and Taylor, as the two get acquainted via life, death and movies in fine fashion. As always it's a real treasure as we hear about so many angles and trajectories including (but not limited to) being a nature boy, his own origin story and how we find him where he is now (in this case, hanging with Brett), native sweats and the benefits of, art imitating life, death and Dads, a horse with the name Banana Bread, and three words that mean so much - 'simple done well'. Glorious - have fun. Oh yes - when he mentions 'FNL' it's 'Friday Night Lights' not SNL like 'Saturday Night Live' - those f's and s's can sound sneakily similar.

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the esteemed and ultra prolific filmmaker CHRIS COLUMBUS ! An absolute joy of an episode featuring someone who is a true mainstay and firm fixture of the modern cinematic universe. You wll have almost certainly seen at least - let's say - two of his films, highly likely more, but a quick gaze through IMDB will give you an idea of the magnitude. A really great catchup and check-in with these two, covering ground including but not limited to the trickiness of imagining the future on film, his heavy back catalogue, the British Invasion (musically), wannabe tough-guy scares, and the fear of losing your family.

Back once again (with the ill behaviour), here's a perfect catch up in resurrected form with the excellent friend of the show and friend of Brett's, Steven Cree. The tone is set from the start, which some loyal listeners will remember from around episode 6, is a tone circling around the fun and silly but tethered to good hearts and a lot of soul. There's a ton about past and upcoming roles including being cast in Brett's film 'All Of You' (forthcoming, at time of publishing) and just so many more layers to their initial meeting all those years ago. 7 years ago in fact.

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with wonderful actor and improviser ZACH BRAFF ! Dearest Films To Be Buried With crew! Last week was the Tony Hale Rewind Classic. This week we have the Zach Braff Rewind Classic. The season is indeed transmitting in a slightly different frequency to usual, but we truly appreciate your continued support and listening ears. Regular service will resume shortly, but for now we are on a bit of a Summer Holiday schedule! The podcast has thrown a tantrum and screamed and screamed and all of us involved in its making have had to sit it in the car with a lil' sippy cup, a lollypop, its favourite teddybear (a fluffy Simba of course), and throw on a ton of easy to sing-a-long playtime jams on the stereo, while we drive it to the seaside where heaven help us we may all get some peace. So thank you for being here, and for being cool and patient while we all resume our composure. Everyone exhausted after that extended metaphor? I can only assume so. X Each Rewind gets a mini brush-up and comb through too, so hopefully you'll be experiencing a \"remastered\" feel too - no quad-surround Dolby action unfortunately but just a slightly nicer iteration for 2025. Below is the original writeup: ––––––––––––––––––––––––– Actor, director, screenwriter, fake doctor. But REAL friend. You may of course know Zach from his full term shift as J.D. in Scrubs, or maybe you saw Garden State, or perhaps some more recent work altogether - well here's your perfect chance to catch up on everything Zach, which includes those fun packed back in the days nuggets, the Scrubs podcast, what the term 'execution dependent' could possibly mean, directing a Ted Lasso and becoming an inventor in the process, younger day sob-fests, and being an HSP! You'll find out. A lovely chirpy episode which you'll love! Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon!

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with wonderful actor and improviser TONY HALE ! Dearest Films To Be Buried With crew! You've just seen the recent season of Rewind episodes come your way, with freshly polished and thoroughly rinsed iterations of past classics to revisit or catch up on if you missed them first time around. We are currently in the season of new episodes as you will have also seen, however this week there was a very sudden schedule conflict. We've been able to navigate them relatively easily in the past but this one was one of those unavoidable types. We would never leave you with nothing of course, and this is a good week to revisit the delightful episode with Tony Hale. It was a really joyful and at times laugh out loud episode, and certainly one worth picking back up if you heard it once already. Tony's hilarious and very good for a story or two, and the ongoing fun about Brett's supernatural gift keeps getting funnier. A really lovely one right here. Below is the original writeup: ––––––––––––––––––––––––– It is likely that you know Tony from his stellar turn in Arrested Development as Buster Bluth, but if not, a cursory glance at his IMDB will reveal a TON of works that you will certainly be familiar with. Tony's a joy here as he and Brett check in and catch up on so much, including Veep, shakey hands in Sopranos, bad acting teachers, unity via Taylor Swift, being in Inside Out and the second one, spirituality and altogether so much more. It's such a good one. You WILL enjoy. Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon!

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe (again) with the comic, actor, writer and producer ZAINAB JOHNSON ! The RESURRECTION ! The venue for this resurrection is the beginning of Zainab's holday, where we catch her getting ready to turn all devices onto airplane mode. Of course, we have MUCH work to get through before this happens, and in doing so we get to hear about so much including holiday process, Zainab's upcoming residency at Edinburgh Fringe ('Toxically Optimistic'), how indeed to pronounce Edinburgh, the 'introducing' credit, being barefoot and pregnant in another timeline, and equalising versus overlising. Pure joy from beginning to end, you'll love this one. And if you hear it before the Fringe and upcoming tours, make efforts to see the live show! Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon!

From the old to the newer, it's an immense body of work but we also hear about such things as what it's actually like to join huge culturally important shows, being a part of long running classic series, the unique instinct that calls for 100+ takes, being cool like M J Fox, and how to dial in a body.

A really lovely, fun and extremely touching episode which contains multitudes. David's been putting in work for years and will very much be a face you'll recognise, if not a name you'll remember, and as always with these talks with Brett we hear so much of what makes the person who they are. In this case, not only do we hear about David's 23 years sober, 50 years of life, his religious upbringing, achieving tone of character via art and music, Z-movies, and past roles - we also hear about his personal life which in this case will require a trigger warning. As David clearly states after going into his experience, help is available and can be found should you or a loved/cared-for one be in similar circumstances. The warning should be observed after the second ad-break here - hard to give an 'out' time as ad-breaks are unpredictable but if you want a clean sweep, give it like 10 minutes.

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the pure twin-force of directing energy DANNY & MICHAEL PHILIPPOU ! In a rare one-off first for Films To Be Buried With, Brett is joined by two people at once (and on one computer mic!), who happen to be two of the most interesting horror film making prospects we've seen for a long time. Some may have become acquainted when Talk To Me came out, and some may go back to the Youtube RackaRacka days, but whatever the case, these two are just so lovable and energetic it is impossible to not become fast fans on that alone. Such a fun and funny episode, this one. Producer Buddy note: They were using a single computer for both of them, and occasionally Zoom can work its own particular brand of magic where it makes some folks quieter, or silences them completely. In this case, the video often makes more sense as you can see them really enjoying the situation and doing a act-out or two, so if you feel like you're missing out on the odd occasion, it's a mix of crazy tech and these two being very visual people!

      "description": "LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! A REWIND CLASSIC! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the absolute FTBBW show idol and long term love KYLE MacLACHLAN ! This Rewind is from January 31st 2024, not so far back in time, originally episode 284, featuring someone very dear to not only all of our hearts, but especially Brett's - Kyle MacLachlan, or as some of you will know from one of his roles in particular, Special Agent Dale Cooper. But let's not limit Kyle to the world of Twin Peaks, for he has been on screens big and small and stage too fo decades, and there will be so many stops along the way where you will have come into contact with his unique work. Kyle is someone who we are so fortune to have with us and even hearing Brett give him his flowers on this episode is just such a joy. I'm sure we all vicariously do the same in listening. This episode was recorded about a year before the death of David Lynch, a celebrated and treasured film maker who truly left a legacy of classic, undeniable and groundbreaking films and television. You'll likely be aware of how much Kyle worked with David, and have seen the results yourself. You can hear how much love and respect there is for David in this podcast, from both Kyle and Brett, and this episode is dedicated to David's memory and legacy. Rest in peace, David Lynch. January 20, 1946 - January 16, 2025. Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon!

This is the first of a two parter... As well as being a unique individual in his own right, Tim is also one of those 'six degrees' people who you can get to and from just about anyone involved in comedy and screen. It speaks well how much Tim is adored in the wider world but also Tim is just awesome in all roles. Whether you met him through one of the various Alan Partridge projects, or through Taskmaster / Alex Horne-iverse, or through appearances in all manner of manifestations, you'll get a ton from this episode (and the subsequent one!) as it's just good times and good vibes from the beginning. You'll hear about the process of short film to feature film (and how to get big stars in said film), the surrealness of Sundance festival, the flying man beginning with E, standing to the side of horror films, G Horne, baths on stage and dancers in bed, and a splinter/rival podcast called 'Speaking Of Films' (not a thing).

THE REINCARNATION! HOUSEKEEPING UP TOP! Occasionaly Brett and Camille refer to each other as ' Connie '. Brett might use ' Ucan ' and ' Udon ' interchangably. ' Sketco ' is sketch comedy. ' Sketco ' is also the pseudonym of the child of Camille and husband James McNicholas (aka ' The Beast '). Should the writeup end there? I mean it sets a tone doesn't it... Well if further selling of this classic and hilarious episode is needed, just know that Camille is wonderful as always, and we also hear about all sorts including the post-childbirth world and the many trials and tribulations but also wonder therein, \"the crawl\", writing a brand new play, George Miller, and some choice encouragement from Brett for Camille to make Mumreels.

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the iconic and massively prolific actor and director JULIA STILES ! A really lovely episode where we find Julia on top form, with a perfect balance of funny and emotional (with a beautiful reaction to being informed of her demise, as show tradition dictates). Julia's been putting in serious work through the years, not least with 'Wish You Were Here', which she directed and goes into detail on. Of course she and Brett go into all sorts of terrain, including said film direction and being a driver as opposed to passenger, behind the scenes process, not being all the way out in the open, line readings (\"Just do it happier!\"), doing your own stunts at a younger age, growing up in New York, and good old fashioned fronting.

But for those who do NOT know, friends, you are about to join an elite group who appreciate performers who provoke that \"blurt\" laugh response (healthier than it sounds). Zach is known for really fun character work and is embarking on the stage at this moment so if you're in those areas, do check the show. But for now, enjoy the ep which deftly moves around the subjects of snowbound New York, his customer service background informing his portrayals, his now very well known mum, how he and his boyfriend met and successfully found a way to collab with work (not always easy!), swimming and sexy chefs.

Jeanette is a delightful presence and utterly essential listening for anyone who is in the least bit interested in space and astronaut life. You'll hear how the whole thing came together but take comfort in knowing that all pertinent questions get answered (not just the film ones - like actual space logistics and how it all works up there), and by the end you'll be a definite pal of Jeanette's and hopefully follow her adventures from here on.

      "description": "LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the modern day legend in sketch comedy MACKENZIE BARMEN ! For some folk, seeing 'TikTok' in the title might seem strange especially if you do not engage with the app. Thankfully for everyone, Mackenzie's amazing and hilarious sketchwork is available on browsers in general if you are not an app download enthusiast and it is strongly recommended to familiarise yourself! From physical embodiment of social media platforms to general character studies, Mackenzie has managed to zero in on something so insightful with such control and observation, and as a guest and friend of the show you'll soon become her friend too (if you are not already). From family dynamics, to process, to career talk, to solo scares, and all the world besides, you will absolutely love this one even if Mackenzie's name is not in your immediate eyeline. Enjoy!

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the prolific and well credited filmmaker and actor LEIGH WHANNELL ! A really lovely chat with someone who you will very likely know from films that have come up many times on this very podcast, so you know you're in for some goodness here... A delightfully self deprecating (in the best ways) and entertaining catch up which covers so much, including but not limited to working with James Wan, making films out of pocket and how to handle low budgets, creating a millennial Freddie Krueger, Insidious and Saw and working on such franchises, devilish alchemy, creative uncoupling, healthy fear of disease and the list goes on! And if you came here for an ethereal Sisyphian tone poem, we've got ya covered. OH ALSO - spoiler bits for Invisible Man where he runs through a scene as he wrote it (which is maybe not so suitable for folk of sensitive disposition) - just so you know.

      "description": "LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the host of Turner Classic Movies and all round movie head BEN MANKIEWICZ ! TCM is a channel that some non-US folk might not be familiar with, but for those who are it's an institution. Ben is a long term host at the channel, but has a huge amount of dealings elsewhere in the cinematic universe too. If that hasn't hooked you in, you might be keen to learn he is the grandson of the screenwriter of Citizen Kane who was the subject of the fairly recent movie 'Mank'. So you're in safe hands right here, essentially. Ben has a ton to say about a lot of movies that haven't been explored that much on the podcast, but it's also really interesting to hear about TCM and how it's affected his own life. A really fascinating guest for a truly engaging episode - enjoy! Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon!

Transmitting from the bedroom office, this is a lovely cosy episode with someone who most certainly brings the funny and curates a really warm, comfortable vibe in the FTBBW labs. Emma delivers a whole gang of wit and wisdom on all things cinematic and existential including lessons learned from podcasting with her daughter, dad bouquets, room altars, moth fairies, and the fine line between anger and passion. And how it can be helpful sometimes to remind yourself and whoever you're with that it's only a film. It's only a film. ENJOY! Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon!

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the brillant actor, music maker and film maker ALEX WOLFF ! As a quick short-hand for regular listeners of the podcast who want a quick face to a name, Alex played Peter in FTBBW classic Hereditary (the whole episode is practically built on a foundation of spoilers so watch that first if it's on your \"to do\" list!). However, Alex is known for so much more! You might know him from The Naked Brothers Band in a younger time, or perhaps more recently A Quiet Place: Day One, or the Jumanji updates. It is a genuine pleasure to know that he's a total film nerd and it's a really fun and funny hang with these two - pure joy and as said, frequent Hereditary spoilers (but context clues will help you if you don't know the film or are not a horror fan).

It's a fabulous thing then to hear this chat with he and Brett and confirm that Jason is indeed every single bit as film nerdy as you would have hoped. But also genuinely entertaining - these worlds are not mutually exclusive! It's a pleasure to hear about all the elements that make up who Jason is, including literally growing up on the Warner Brothers lot, loving comedians, depicting the pleasure of work in films, community of cinema, his father Ivan (some incredible history you'll hear there), surrender, James Acaster, and among so much more, the choreography and design of his new film Saturday Night!

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the excellent actor who - for those less familiar - played Pacey in Dawson's Creek, it's JOSHUA JACKSON ! Of course, it would be unfair to limit his notoreity to a single character in one show, but for many of us it was a massive TV event in a time when the media landscape and viewing habits were simply very different to what they are now, so pretty much we all saw it! If your knowledge of him were to end there, well, you'll be happy to know he's been entirely busy since and remains a pure ray of light. This episode rules, and Joshua shows up wonderfully. It handles the funny, the serious, and the existential, all with grace and energy, and will leave you wanting to repeat the whole thing when you get to the end. Topics in the hopper include timeframes as a younger person, positive homesickness, Vancouver, the tough and weird experience of being so famous so young, love of the longform series, having kids and five year plans?

      "description": "LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the Chicago-originating rapper, producer, podcaster, writer and much more - it's OPEN MIKE EAGLE ! As Brett mentions in the intro and podcast, I (producer Buddy Peace) am a huge fan of Mike's (since the very early 20teens, maybe earlier?), and will gladly push his work to anyone in the safe knowledge they will enjoy it and in turn become very big fans too. So it's a joy to have his presence here with Brett, talking about all things film, comedy and music in the same place. They get along gloriously from jump, and you'll love it - a perfect fireside chat type ep, with some awesomely fun goodies including bathroom stuff and plumbing (no spoils), hotel mornings and protocol, how bad films happen, experiences in making TV shows, cafe death mirages and no horrors please! Listen to all Mike's insanely fresh music linked below, listen to his podcast series 'What Had Happened Was' (series-long interviews recently featuring Questlove), and explore all the related goings on. Mike is an incredible rapper, who has relations to the almight Project Blowed collective in LA, and works with so many of the best \"otherground\" (?) artists in the game - please do check him out if you're even halfway in on Hip Hop music. You'll love him. ENJOY! Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon!

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the hilarious writer, comic and actor HEIDI GARDNER ! Heidi is well versed in the world of Saturday Night Live, an institution hugely loved and regarded in the US but not amazingly well known in the UK. So it's a lovely thing to hear some behind the scenes chat from someone so woven into the tapestry of it, for anyone who's a long term fan or someone less familiar. Of course the chat goes so much further, with her hairdressing history, cats, process, monologues, threatening coaches of the mind, videos, watching horrors too young and the Scared Straight model of film education.

As such, David knows what's what, as you will hear clearly on this fantastic and fun episode with a ton of the usual behind the scenes goodness - and as always, not just the studio scenes. It's continually amazing how interlinked the cinematic and let's say 'real' worlds are, and how they reflect and work with how our own heads and imaginations do.

Below will be the original writeup for this episode which originally aired on 22nd September 2022. A tremendous episode which might have been a first meeting with Quinta for some, but by now with any luck you'll be well acquainted with her work and the wide world of Abbott Elementary! This episode was at a truly busy point of her career and it's only gotten busier, so enjoy this look back into the recent past to hear some wisdom and fun and good times from not long ago. Hopefully there'll be the new season kicking off next week so stay locked on for that - but as always, thanks so much for being here with us through the 'bridge season' while things are being constructed. It's me on the intro/outro (your producer Buddy Peace), so don't be alarmed. I mean you no shock or surprise. Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon! ––––––––––––––––––––––––– STOP – Emmy time ... A marvelous chat with Quinta, who you might know from the wonderful Abbott Elementary in more recent / present times. If you don't know Quinta, consider this your introduction to someone who is making power moves in the world of excellent media - she is BUSY but as you'll hear, has a proper grip on things and maintains clarity, sanity and that all important fun-ness that is so necessary in such a high pressure environment (showrunning and all that entails). So take a nice break and enjoy this lovely episode, and of course check Abbott Elementary among her other work! IMDB ABBOTT ELEMENTARY A.E. trailer EMMY TIME!

Below will be the original writeup for this episode which originally aired on 6th September 2018. A marvellous episode marking the first appearance of Ed, which would open the door to a further two down the line. This is prime Ed and Brett, and even an appearance from other show pal Lou Sanders who sews a seed for her eventual Cuddle Club podcast! You heard it here first (all the way back in 2018).

It’s a bundle of fun for certain but do be warned, there are some elements where some heavy films are referenced - so with that in mind, be prepared for some potentially tough ground in there… ALSO - there are spoilers for Hereditary so watch out for that when they start going in… I’ll make a note below on times. Otherwise, this episode has it all! Big men acting as nannies, Hulk Hogan, horror chat, film gossip, just tons of fun for you devour and get dizzy from, like these two. Highly enjoyable - go in!!!

It is incredible stuff but if that’s something that you’d rather miss, just jump ahead to half hour in, or so. On top of that gold, Desiree goes into the nuanced differences of the throuple vs the threesome, waiting rooms with life and death, growing up in Diamond Bar, California and a ‘give you the chills’ moment concerning her scariest film.

It’s great though, as they get into all he’s doing, been up to, past lives, not a yes and not a no, pots of despair, therapy, drama school madness, shedding no tears and past rap interest. There was a degree of environmental wind to balance out so this might not sound quite as ‘full’ as your regularly scheduled episodes - you shouldn’t notice too much upheaval though.

It's a really great episode as you will well expect from Jamali, but it also touches on some serious topics to do with his own near death experience in South East Asia, and some of his experiences making the show 'Hate Thy Neighbour'. Nothing too rough but as with the best episodes, it's a great mixture of tone and feel.

But damn. He’s been able to weave out of being typecast though in some very smart moves which led him to Taskmaster, though not without some non-documentary related near deathe experiences along the way and all manner of mad stories to accompany.

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the fabulous, the truly great, the acting legend that is SHARON STONE ! Below will be the original writeup for this episode which originally aired around June 2020. It was in the early days of the pandemic, when the world seemed truly bizarre, scary and plain weird. It's odd sometimes to think back especially when it's to a specific episode, as it can really timewarp you back there more than just a vague general memory of the era. Sharon was a delight, and rose to the occasion spectacularly, so please enjoy this glimpse into the past! It's me on the intro/outro (your producer Buddy Peace), so don't be alarmed. I mean you no shock or surprise. Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon! ––––––––––––––––––––––––– I was going to start with “You may remember Sharon from such films as…”, but of course - that ‘may’ is redundant and superfluous. You KNOW her from such films as Basic Instinct, Sliver, Casino and SO so many more, and her filmography is as strong as it gets with appearances in all kinds of great movies dating back to the early 80’s. She and Brett meet in her garden (with a remote Brett in his house), for a very fun, interesting and revealing chat which goes into her past acting experiences, life and important work she’s been involved with around the world. Truly fascinating, you’ll love this one.

      "description": "LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with one of the UK's finest, it's RAY WINSTONE ! You did indeed read that correctly. Brett caught up with Ray for a glorious episode which could have only been improved if it was conducted in person, but if Ray is available you take him any way you can bloody well get him. If you don't know him, he starred in huge films such as Sexy Beast, The Departed and Beowulf to name a few. Of course, a lot of his filmography gets covered here but on top of that, we hear about shouting at the screen, early David Lynch experiences, creating magic on a non-real film set, being an avid viewer of movies from all across the globe, getting over language hurdles in films and so much more. A true delight. ENJOY! (note: Ray mentioned a film where someone has amnesia - looks like it might be ' Random Harvest ' - in case you're curious!) Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon!

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with legendary actor who we've seen on-screen for almost all his life - it's TYLER JAMES WILLIAMS ! Just by way of speed intro, Tyler played a young Chris Rock in Everybody Hates Chris, which you might recall from a minute ago. But a more up to date credit would be the fabulous Abbott Elementary, which has just been picked up for a 4th season so here's to more Quinta and Tyler and the gang! Anyway - a delightful episode, with ups and downs like you wouldn't believe - the 'Sesame Street Peak', memoirs, fear as an indicator in life, couples being too sexy, dogs breaking the fourth wall in heaven (never typed those words in that order before), avoiding troublesome phases of a young actor's life, and a rugged near death period of his life where work nearly concluded his whole story... A brilliant ep. Enjoy! Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon!

Eddie is one of the busiest folks in showbiz, and has a lot to share about it all. So much to enjoy including his dislike for typecasting and being put in a box, drama school days, jelag secrets, chilling with Jim Broadbent and Bob The Butcher, on-set behaviour, family commutes, the society and vampire connection and acting like a mechanic.

We have a little seasonal tradition over here at the Films To Be Buried With labs, where Brett kindly offers the floor to me to present a mix for you all... I'm a DJ and producer of music as well as podcasts, and it's a chance to select a bunch of bits and pieces I've made over the past as a little diversion to the usual format. Some of these are unreleased and never heard before, one or two are where I added scratches, but mostly it's all tracks or sections of mixtapes I've made. I really hope you enjoy! I'll get a tracklist of sorts up in one way or another, but links below will take you towards the best places to locate what I make. Thank you so much, huge love and my immense gratitude to Brett, and you all listening. It means a lot.

It's nothing but joy from the first moment, but she and Brett also get into a ton of bits and pieces including leaving Saturday Night Live, the desire of a return to acting (villains specifcally), doing a bunch of standup, being a night owl kid, Ghostbusters, Shirley Temple, bad knees as an aphrodisiac and on top of all that, a RED HOT new film pitch or two from them both.

We find Fortune halfway through a current tour, and hear all about her wanderings around the world performing (and the toll it takes on precious ones in her life - often unseen and unsympathised tolls), filming with none other than the fabuous Arnold Schwarzenegger and how he's basically a Fortune superfan at this point, sad films, revelations and film feels, and all the greatness you can and should expect.

So make sure first off that you check out her many projects and bits going on, most of which will be linked below... This is a great chat with Felicia and Brett, as they delve deep into the top-of-mind and back-of-mind film goodies that are all in there bubbling away at all times... It's really interesting hearing from a creator of many things about the process and what it takes to make it all happen, and with such a lot of ground covered it's a true plate spinning act making sure none of them drop. Well lucky for us all, every plate is perfectly rotating in Felicia's world and we get to hear about all that, monetising a hobby, seeing certain films way too early, mainstream female perspective, and a sub-genre of adult entertainment that we find out appeals to the octo-genarians among us.

It was a funny one as well as a touching one, and you'd be surprised at how little you can detect the edited interruptions from Rob's little human companions! That deserves its own podcast. Anyway it's a lovely revisit, this one - you'll have probably seen Rob in a few things since the original episode, and maybe you've come to know him since it came out too, but whatever the weather, it's a great one. ENJOY! ––––––––––––––––––––––––– Pure goodness all round in this lovely bubbly get together, with Rob taking to the format and theme with effortless finesse. You know the deal by now, folks - a healthy dose of real life, humour of all the shades on the spectrum and ruminations, thoughts and theories on all that entails… Lockdown, growing into acting roles, his perspective on death with some very personal dealings over the past couple of years, horror as therapy, musicals, Deadpool 2, and all round delightful movie-based fun. People of podcasting persuasion - get to know (better) Rob Delaney!

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with hilarious comic and writer JEN BRISTER ! The RESURRECTION edition! Below will be the original writeup for this episode which originally aired October 1st 2020. This one's a Resurrection - a version of the podcast which you've surely heard before but if not, the format will make a lot of sense once you're listening... Basically Jen is brought back to life from the previous appearance, and comes back with loads more answers to different questions. Crazy fun! Even if you've heard it before, it's WELL worth a re-up. ENJOY! Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon! (video available where possible) ––––––––––––––––––––––––– A beautiful encore covering everything since her last appearance and a whole load more, as you shall hear… Life has taken many a path since those days back in the pre-teen episodes of the podcast (Jen made her FTBBW debut on episode 11), including the addition of children, a fresh new pandemic to deal with and negotiate, making standup comedy happen in non-standup environments, ‘sad vs bleak’, and many many more memories and stories besides. It’s excellent and will make you lust for the third appearance… In the meantime though - please enjoy Jen’s resurrection! ALL LINKS HERE!

Below will be the original writeup for this episode which originally aired February 21st 2019. Even further back than the previous week's rewind, which makes it so fascinating to re-contextualise. This was recorded before pandemic times, and literally almost 2 months after Athena giving birth, so it's a huge one - so enjoyable and definitely one worth hearing once more in all its glory. Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon! (video available where possible) ––––––––––––––––––––––––– Surely one of the most hardcore Films To Be Buried With guests at that, as Athena is mere days after giving birth - that’s some solid dedication to the craft of podcasting right there! And we are blessed by her golden presence, as Brett sets things off proper from the get go, which provides us with gem after gem including her brand new parent role, attending the cinema with her then unborn baby and working out what it responded to, how she enjoys her horror movies with a cup of sweet tea at the end (that’s actually a perfect combo) and SO much more… How much more? Well, the question “What in the world happened to Billy Zane?” gets posed, and also Athena makes Brett very angry - why, you may ask? Oh… You’ll find out… While films get spoiled all over the shop in the podcast, this writeup is a spoiler-free zone, people. ENJOY ATHENA! HOME IMDB INSTAGRAM TWITTER MANY LINKS!

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with wonderful actor and all round good person SARAH SNOOK ! Below will be the original writeup for this episode which originally aired January 16th 2020. Can you believe it... How much life we've lived since those days long since completed and now behind us. Well, here is a lovely chance to revisit one of those historical days with a pure feelgood shot of FTBBW gold, from episode 79! Of course a lot of folks will know Sarah from Succession, which went on to become a pure televisual phenomenon, but make sure you investigate her many roles in other shows and films because she's truly excellent. Australia's Emma Stone? You got it! ENJOY! Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon! (video available where possible) ––––––––––––––––––––––––– Surely you must know Sarah as ‘Shiv’ from the quite wonderful series ‘Succession’, which is almost too good to even begin getting into here - i would venture to say that you should track it down and prepare for a weekend indoors while you race to get it all finished... If not, keep it in mind for the future okay? Anyway - you will hugely enjoy this one, as Sarah is a delight and does not feature on a to of podcasts either, so it’s a rare treat indeed! They get into many objects of chat including some choice afterlife nuggets involving bread (gold lies within that one), fancy cinemas, days of childhood, that old chestnut and everyone’s friend AALS (aka Altitude Adjusted Lachrymosity Syndrome or crying on planes), how to cry on film and forgetting the film Titanic. Glorious! You’ll love it! You’ll love Sarah!

Ruby is in the perfect spot in this podcast, as you'll hear - life, death, everything in those levels between, these are well within Ruby's wheelhouse as we kick things off with some good old fashioned Hollywood ghost tales. Do things let up from there? Not a chance. From said ghostly times, to the millenial approach to ghostbusting (or rather, ghost therapy), to past lives, birth charts, Natasha Lyonne, actors and acting and theories within, right up to a positively mortifying cinema experience.

On top of all that there's a huge amount of fun to be had obviously, as Cally is a standup so you're in safe hands from the start.

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with Ted Lasso himself, and the comic mind behind so many and so much - JASON SUDEIKIS ! For many of you, let's be honest - this is the one you've been waiting for. Ted Lasso finally meets Roy Kent for a true game of one on one but this time, it's nothing but films. And some existential bits and pieces too, naturally. For those uninitiated, Jason has been working incredibly hard in all areas of the comedy world, in movies and Saturday Night Live to name a mere two things, but we don't often get to hear the stories behind it all. The journey, the path, the choices, the behind the scenes goodness and how often it all links up with cinema. Possibly too much to synopsise in this paragraph, and enough to warrant a two part podcast, so for all Jason enthusiasts of any depth, this one is perfect. BELIEVE!

Below is the original writeup - we'll have more awesome rewinds for you this Summer! You’ll surely recognize the surname, but that is not why we’re here today… Moon has been making power moves out there in the US for a while now, with a huge amount of work to her name, and this week it’s her time to talk about all things movies, from her childhood days up to the present. It’s a superb selection of cinematic treats of course, but on top of that there are dips into such topics as the ‘forever library’, being ultra intuitive as a kid, having a very specific nervous system and how it came about, her parents (specifically her father Frank), and the utter madness inspired by book tours. So much to dig into, and a fantastic ride as the first episode of 2021! Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon!

Interior. We open on a dusky, dark room with the glow of a laptop illuminating the immediate area surrounding it. A slow zoom in on the screen to reveal not a documentary, nor a game, nor a Youtube video - but a Zoom chat. Folks, think back to pandemic times if you will, for a second, to remember the viral horror film 'Host' - this was the scene in most domestic settings for the more scary film appreciative amongst us... Well, cut to the now-times and the director of said film is at it again with The Boogeyman! You'll hear all about all of this, from the director himself - Rob joins Brett for a wonderful episode containing process, genre, life, death and general movie chat, and it's a brilliant one. Certainly one to make your head spin. But hopefully not projectile vomit. The power of film compels you! Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon!

But what's so lovely is everything else included, branching out into the showrunner as therapist role, dealing with notes from the execs, process, Tyler Perry, Disneyland, hugely significant deaths and revelations, double 2s, the single-use Pixar movie, growing up in Texas, the definition of 'camp' and boujie daddies covered in blood.

Join your host Brett Goldstein for a special REWIND edition, as he talks life, death, love and the universe with brilliant comic, actor, writer and podcaster SUZI RUFFELL ! A lovely chance to catch up on an episode for the books... Below is the original writeup: A perfect chance right here to get in on some classics and a whole world of glorious tangents with Brett and the awesome Suzi, as they catch up like good old pals RIGHT IN FRONT OF US - but of course we get front row seats and you’ll be ever so thankful we did. Suzi has been in the game for a minute, and chances are you will have caught her on TV or hopefully managed to hit up one of her standup shows - her tour is looking healthy for the last half of the year so you’ll surely have a chance to get in some Suzi time very soon… Anyway - the podcast! If you’re easily spooked out then you might want to listen to this in daylight as she and Brett trade a couple of super eerie ghost stories (this is the podcast for it, right?), her thoughts on horror and gore, the representation of queer characters and the storylines which often come with that and a true showstopper of a story involving her dad going to prison in Italy. It’s as insane and amazing as you imagine… Maybe more so… So enjoy this week’s episode with the great and grand SUZI RUFFELL! Video and extra audio available on Brett's Patreon!

Listen to them get into a whole ton of mad tangents including a very solid premise for a reality show (I won’t even spoil it by mentioning the name - it’s brilliant), her involvement in the writer’s room on Sex Education, her Sky short ‘Love The Sinner’ which sounds amazing, being a bit psychic, thoughts on Capricorns, sleep paralysis, Nollywood, Abba pilgrimages, and her acting world!

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with comic and writer RHYS JAMES ! ...but not for the first time OH GOOD GRACIOUS no... For this is the resurrection of young Rhys! Let's see how this hotshot deals with that particular situation, shall we? Ah I'll just let you know, he handles it perfectly and makes it an awesome episode. A magical potion of all things Mock The Week / Dave, the backstage yin and yang of he and Brett, expecatation, how to be a perfect audience member, cinema bonding, cool versus geek, dying on stage versus dying in a social situation and blagging that you've seen a film. Wonderful fun and everything you'd wish for in a repeat from Rhys. And when people ask you what you thought of this episode? Be sure to tell them \"Eh, I've heard bits of it\". That will stump them.

Hotel rooms are basically podcast studios with sleeping and bathroom facilities, right? Anyway - another brilliant episode for the books, as Chloe and Brett connect on the good stuff including Edinburgh audiences demanding a narrative arc, Crystal Palace and football, death waves and rats (rats in a figurative sense tho, don't worry). Bright and breezy and lovely, you'll dig it for certain. Go catch Chloe on tour near you!!! GOOD PLACE spoiler about 15 minutees in, careful if you're in the middle of that...

A glorious meeting between Brett and Yoda as the two connect on all things cinematic and musical, but also educational as - who could've guessed - they shared a university! You may know Yoda from his extensive catalogue of mixtapes, albums, AV shows or maybe the real hardcore fans among you know his old rap magazine columns and involvements. Some of you may have just seen the name Yoda and thought, this will be an awesome episode. Whatever your meeting point, it's full on film geekout action from jump, including highly enjoyable tangents on US breakfast cereals, reppraising old films, the process of DJing and what goes into it all, and of course, the element that really bonds these two movie hounds, a shared and sacred love of all things David Lynch.

If you've been or even performed there you'll surely relate to the whole thing! Otherwise they get into all sorts which spur from films or life or death (or all three), which include all kinds of life lessons and happenings, brushes with the wider world of comedy and various family bits and pieces which truly let us into the world of Ania.

Join your host Brett Goldstein for a special REWIND edition, as he talks life, death, love and the universe with actor and writer JAMIE DEMETRIOU ! Such a good episode from a good while back now, in full face to face style as we used to do back in the day (and starting to do again in the now times). So much to enjoy and a great catch up if you didn't hear this one first time round. Enjoy! Below is the original writeup - NEW EP NEXT WEEK! Be prepared for another smash this week, as Brett and Jamie get into some right mischief beginning with how alike they look (and all ensuing comparisons), the investment of grief into the final euphoria of making ‘the thing’ (whatever ‘the thing’ may be), future plans and the years ahead, season 2 of Stath Lets Flats (which is already causing Jamie grief!), how his pocket money was spent almost entirely in Video Viking, hubbubs and hullaballoos, playing as a kid - what even is it and what are we DOING here?, being a cool kid and rejecting horror films, the fun of watching his dad reacting to films, digital vs analog effects, derivative and non-derivative and all manner of deep tangents and heavy philosophising!

      "description": "LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein for a special REWIND edition, as he talks life, death, love and the universe with comic and actor ROMESH RANGANATHAN ! A lovely oppportunity to catch up with an episode from the archives, which was a true ray of light in a very difficult time. Of course, times are differently difficult now but this opens a window on a time not far from recent memory, where we were looking for laughter and distraction while also dealing with an unprecedented crisis. Naturally things don't dwell on that part - it's more just for context. Below is the original writeup for the episode - enjoy!!! The memories of an actual face to face encounter now seem so old and faded, it’s hard to even consider such an event. Let alone a live show. Can you even imagine? Well, with things as they are still, Brett has brought the podcast vehicle to your door with facemask and gloved hands once again, with guest in tow, the excellent multi-threat comic Romesh over the internet! Proper good times to be had, conversationally roaming freely with reckless abandon that brings to mind those halcyon days of a couple of months ago, including being a national treasure (Romesh won’t have any of it), his Mum being a breakaway star, the thrill of trying to master stuff (especially in lockdown times), working with the family in the picture and what mayhem or paradise that brings, packing for the afterlife, knockoff Care Bears and a HECK ton more. Such a good one, you’ll thoroughly enjoy. Be excellent to each other folks - shouts and love to you all X ROMESH ONLINE TWITTER HIP HOP SAVED MY LIFE THE MISADVENTURES OF ROMESH RANGANATHAN ASIAN PROVOCATEUR BRETT GOLDSTEIN on TWITTER BRETT GOLDSTEIN on INSTAGRAM BRETT GOLDSTEIN on PATREON TED LASSO SOULMATES SUPERBOB (Brett's 2015 feature film) CORNERBOYS with BRETT & SCROOBIUS PIP DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on FACEBOOK DISTRACTION PIECES NETWORK on INSTAGRAM Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/filmstobeburiedwith .

Join your host Brett Goldstein for a special REWIND edition, as he talks life, death, love and the universe with human diamond YVETTE NICOLE BROWN ! A chance to catch a debut appearance from the wonderful radiator that is Yvette - below is the original writeup, and this episode was originally broadcast on March 4th, 2021. It was a very interesting time we were living through back then, and this is an episode which gave that instant feelgood appeal while addressing said time sensitive oddities... Which of course, continue their ripples... You will know Yvette from something. That much is sure. She’s been putting in work for a minute now and that work is of the highest order, so whether it’s from television to voiceover to fully fledged superhero movie, she is immensely prolific. She is also an amazing guest, as someone who is very in tune with people vibes while bringing us all closer together in ways we never expected. Just ask Brett and his writing team! What more would you expect from someone who describes people as ‘delicious’? Get to know Yvette so much better throughout this lovely episode including her being a radiator, helping and being a helper, ugly crying and being a recluse. And a blerd. Yvette contains multitudes.

Join your host Brett Goldstein for a special REWIND edition, as he talks life, death, love and the universe with debut guest JAMES ACASTER ! You often hear the phrase \"our guest needs no introduction\", by way of saying \"you clearly know who this is, right?\" - well in this case, it might actually be true as he has appeared on here at least three times! AND has had multiple intros... James is an original friend of the show and was the debut guest, so while Brett handles a ton of non-podcast essentials, this is your chance to listen back to that fabled first episode. It's a treat, as we catch James on the launch of his 4 part Netflix extravaganza which you can still see, but also hear so much of what things were like at that point in time which is a lot of fun. So enjoy! New episodes coming - stay tuned. For now though, enjoy!

Toheeb last appeared on here all those years ago in August 2020 - but Brett has brought young Toheeb back to go through the whole beautiful cinematic ordeal one more time, for the wonder of us all! A lovely one, as we get to catch up on a ton of Toheeb goodness, and hear those new questions out in the open along with new revelations including drama school scuffles, self tapes, our old friend AALS (or Altitude Adjusted Lachrymosity Syndrome or crying on planes), TWO new film premises, and an exciting new marriage pact! What a treat. Find out of he makes it through - ENJOY!

      "description": "LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with very funny comic SIKISA ! A lovely one with Sikisa and Brett, as the two catch up and check in on all things film, life and comedy. Sikisa is - at the time of typing and broadcasting (August 2022) - currently holding it down at the Ediburgh Fringe with her excellent show 'Life Of The Party' (links below), and this will be either a perfect introduction if you don't know her, or accompaniment if you're fortunate enough to have made her acquaintance. Sikisa also provides even more evidence that Barbados might just be the place for all of us. She's not sponsored by the Tourist Board Of Barbados by the way but if they come knocking, Brett surely will accommodate. Enjoy the show!

      "description": "LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with writer, journalist and podcaster SARAH MARSHALL ! Okay just to get it out the way, yes there's a shared name with a comedy film that you may be familiar with, but all any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events, is purely coincidental (or something along those lines). Long openers aside, this is a fantastic episode with Brett and Sarah checking in on all kind of awesome trivia, facts, rumours and allegations from all over the place! It's a really fun one, and if you know Sarah from her wonderful podcast you'll have an idea of where her head is at - and for that reason, this episode never drops below fascinating.

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the UK's favourite film critic and full time Wittertainer MARK KERMODE ! ...or is that 'Witter-Take-r'? Heritage listeners will answer that one... Folks, Brett is joined once more by Doctor Kermode for a perfect follow up to his previous encounter, as they cover much ground yet uncovered, including loads of cool personal bits and pieces (within reason), as well as tremors of Kermodian rants (kind of), and some excellent horror theories and thoughts that always entertain and inform. One takeaway from this I guess is that you should watch Jeremy. Or not? But definitely The Exorcist. Ultimately, do you , but also think What Would Mark Kermode Do? And then make your choice. Enjoy! See you all SOON! Huge love from all of us on Team Films To Be Buried With.

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the first guest to ever appear on the podcast - it's JAMES ACASTER ! Episode 200, folks. A big one. We made it. And what better way to celebrate than by getting the first ever guest and show favourite Jamesback on board to talk all things life and film... James is awesome and you know it's a winner with him and Brett - there is clear evidence of this in the show archives if needed - so please enjoy this big numbered episode as Brett takes a breather (after one more forthcoming ep, that is), and let's celebrate what we've all done here. Smell the flowers. Inhale for like 4 seconds and exhale for, I dunno, 5. Have a nap. Take a rest. Read a book. But know that Films To Be Buried With continues in our minds, souls and ears forever. And maybe in a real, tangible sense. We shall see. We all love you very much, and while we'll be back next week for one more goody, let's take this chance to celebrate - bests to you all, and huge love. Be excellent to each other.

By now, you might have come into contact with the film Mass. Perhaps you've heard Mark Kermode review and speak on it with huge fondness, or you've heard a recommendation from a friend, or maybe it's made itself known to you by appearing on your streaming platform. What's important to know is that if you are yet to see it, and don't want to know about the content, then this could be an episode worth coming to after. If not - this will be the absolute perfect accompaniment to the film, which clearly still has a huge impact on Fran and how could it not? So enter in, knowing that there is definitely in depth talk about the film (Brett's been so up for talking about for ages now), as well as the usual awesomeness that you can expect from the podcast. Fran is a brilliant guest and this episode delivers on so many levels, so make room for it and definitely give it some time.

A great chat with Fin and Brett, as they chat all things film and life and death which incorporates a ton of what’s happening right here in the present. Thankfully the present has much to offer in this case, as Fin has a new standup special out (link below) as well as (possibly more importantly) a new child! We hear all about his new (quote) “wholesome and folksy” lifestyle, brushes with movies, big cinema dogs, revelations pertaining to Nick Cage and tin flutes, said comedy special and all sorts besides. Shamless! Enjoy!

      "description": "LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the wonderful presenter, broadcaster and podcaster CLARA AMFO ! A true grin-inducing glory of an episode as Brett catches up with Clara, with pure fun from start to end (though, of course, mixed in with some of that old death and existence stuff for some extra balance, you know how we do). A perfect summary of loads of what we know and love of Clara, bringing in gems and treasures from her life in front of the lens and mic, including some of the pure madness of going live from the red carpet, being a very self aware empath, working with and conducting so many energies, being the cat from that old curiosity chestnut, coriander (aka The Devil's Herb), local memories and fun times at the cinema. Wonderful, you're gonna truly love this one - and Clara obviously. Enjoy!

Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the amazing writer, director and comic PAUL FEIG ! You have a huge amount of portals into the incredible work of Paul, but one that you will be very familiar with through your dedicated listening to this podcast will be Bridesmaids. Well, even that frequent flyer of the podcast is a mere tip of an icerberg in an ocean crammed with icebergs (okay, analogy over) as Paul has been involved with an immense amount of hilarious and brilliant movies in his career, alongside authoring a ton of books and dabbling with standup in the 80s too. This is an ace chance to catch up with he and Brett to hear about his own movie life and loves, past projects, forthcoming goodies and extra curricular activities! Much enjoyment. Get in on it.
