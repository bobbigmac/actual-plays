This week Jack and Jenny revisit series 14 to find out whether or not Leo from Toronto was right in nominating episode 7 as 'one of the best episodes of Taskmaster ever.' We also get insight as to whether or not Jenny would ever faff around with a she-wee, and Jack outs himself as a Vera-viewer. Plus a fan asks us to consider who Greg's favourite contestant has been, and Jack brings the stats to answer. Next week we'll be delving into series 5, episode 5 to find out if sex really can sell a task. Have a homework suggestion, a goof or a bloop or want to send in your predictions about series 19?

      "description": "This week Jenny and Jack hear from the voice behind the infamous Mr. Blobby task, unleashing some bonus Blobby factoids and behind the scenes insights thanks to Production Manager Sophie. Plus, Jack discusses whether or not there’s any hope for the increasing gap between contestant scores, stats-wise, and why Dara should be a little afraid. We also learn why Greg might want to torch the John’s Howdah prize task after hearing this podcast and whether Alex could ever survive without a clipboard. Don't worry, there's some good old fashioned pedantry too, with a brief philosophical exploration into what it actually means to walk towards a duck if you live on a spherical planet.

David talks about what prompted him to start his own version of Taskmaster, how he writes his tasks, what lessons he learned after his first series, why he's not trying to be like Little Alex Horne, and a secret loophole from his second series that he has never revealed until now. But before that, Jenny and Jack review Series 5, Episode 8 in another vintage homework assignment - can you guess which moment brought Jenny to tears?

This week Jenny and Jack are talking all about the infamous opening episode of Series 2. So will Jenny turn out to be a Potato Truther? Did Richard Osman irreversibly change the course of Taskmaster history? Does Katherine Ryan need to spend more time in Ikea (specifically Croydon)? You'll need to listen to find out, of course! Next week the pair assign themselves Series 5, Episode 8 - feel free to rewatch and relive through Jenny's eyes. Plus, Jack revisits the question about whether or not it gives contestants an advantage to read out live tasks, but this time looking at it all from a slightly different statistical angle. And, of course, we have your fan mail. This week there are questions about Champion of Champion scoring, and whether or not UK contestants are discouraged from watching Taskmaster New Zealand.

This week Jenny and Jack are making their Series 17 predictions, and guess what? They've brought our beloved Lou Sanders and her Magic 8 Ball back in to help! Jenny once again uses her waters to make her prediction, and Jack uses ever-reliable stats. They also ask question such as: will podcasters do well on the show? Is this the most talented cast of all time? And will Greg be scared of Steve Pemberton? Plus, Jack accidentally pitches Survivor in the form of 'Taskmaster Island' and Jenny pitches an even higher-stakes format about whether or not she'd be able to tolerate being stuck in a lift with various people. Don't worry, Jenny has also done her vintage Taskmaster episode homework, and this time it's all about Tony Three Pies.

This week it's all about the GRAND FINAL of series 16... and the grand outfit reveal of Jenny's dreams! The pair have a lot to digest, not least the shocking news about beaver anal secretions from Susan Wokoma's prize task. And the shocks continue as Jack and Jenny watch Julian close in on Sam's big lead in series points, while Sue and Susan give us a glorious glimpse of a Taskmaster Hotel experience. But perhaps the most shocking reveal comes from Lou's Magic 8 Ball, when Jack and Jenny revisit predictions made before the series began. Plus, a fan who happens to be a robot vacuum engineer writes in to settle an ongoing debate from regarding a certain episode 6 task. Don't worry, just because series 16 has ended does NOT mean we have any less to discuss and, as always, we love to hear from you - The People. lf you want to get in touch and relive your favourite series 16 moments or use a Magic 8 Ball to tell us what you think will happen next in the Taskmaster universe, then please send it to fans@taskmaster.tv to get in touch.

      "description": "Turn the lock on the bathroom door and tell your family you might be a little while - it's time for another episode of Taskmaster The People's Podcast! The UK Series 16 has begun and Jenny and Jack are giddy with excitement. In this week's episode Jenny gives her initial impressions of the first episode and Jack gives his signature statistical outlook. Now that they've seen Julian, Sam, Lucy and The Susans in action, how do they feel about their own series 16 predictions? Were the pair able to spot any goofs, sploofs, or - heaven forbid - floops? Plus Jack grovels in a goof-related apology to his new co-host, and Jenny weighs in on a fan question about whether or not Greg is the strictest Taskmaster out of all the Taskmasters. As always, we love to hear from you - The People. What do you think of the new series? Do you have statistical itch that needs scratching? Or perhaps you've spotted the elusive sploof. If so, then please email fans@taskmaster.tv to get in touch. Your time starts... NOW!

This week Jenny and Jack can practically smell the new series of Taskmaster, it's so close now. And, aside from being giddy in anticipation, Jack is sweating under the pressure of having to build a cot, Jenny is starting to notice Taskmaster fans in the audience while on tour, and they reminisce about past encounters with Greg's 'great big leathery liver.' Plus they chat a little more about Taskmaster New Zealand, use stats to predict the next Champion of Champions using stats, and answer a fan's question about whether studio audiences get to see more task footage than the viewers at home.

That's right, we're saying goodbye to our beloved host as she spreads her wings and takes flight to new career heights post release of her latest mem-ha-ha (and future release of 24 Parrot Gold?). Jack and Lou discuss what this will mean for the podcast and play a game of Alex Horne-style 20 questions to try to guess who the new host will be. That's not all - Lou's cats have new names, Jack uses the power of stats to come up with the best colour to wear if you want to win Taskmaster, and we inadvertently learn that Jack also might be colourblind. Plus Lou answers some fan mail about her custom outfit (and dishes some hot goss about other contestant outfits as well) and we reminisce on some of our favourite podcast memories.

This week Jack experiences a perfect side parting possibly gifted by Jesus himself, Lou gives us some updates from her Summer of Love and they both discuss the newly announced Australian Taskmaster contestants. Chloe writes in with a conundrum for Stat-man Jack and Lou comes up with a way to up the stakes for disqualifications with her new Taskmaster format. Jack also stumbles across what he thinks is his ticket to a secret Taskmaster Elite club. If you're hankering for some bloops, fear not - we take a little field trip to Bloop City Centre and back. Lovely Laura prompts some questions about Wet David Attenborough and the composer of the Ask The Andy's jingle writes in to discuss recent rumours about viking ruins in a Dublin Lidl. If you want to get in touch with Jack and Lou, ask a question to the Andy's, or try your luck at joining the Taskmaster Elite by exposing some Taskmaster secrets, then you can email fans@taskmaster.tv OR leave a voice note on the Fanswering machine.

Turns out she's not really a child at all, but a grownup, accomplished playwright and all around cool parent - the wonderful Phoebe Eclair-Powell! They discuss her mum's previous experience with barges, why Phoebe's never eaten chilli from a boot, and also what is was like to see her son on Taskmaster and why she wants #justiceforArlo Lou and Jack also discuss whether its better to be a loser or average, Lou uses her parkour skills to recover from a fall, and Jack's daughter has adopted a TMPP phrase - can you guess which one?

This week Jack tells us about his quite harrowing Taskmaster dream, Lou tells us about Noni juice, wizard sticks and some viking remains she found beneath a Lidl in Dublin, and the pair consult the Archangel Michael and a Magic 8 Ball to try and make some sensical predictions about Series 16. Jack also consults the power of stats to determine whether being vegan helps you win at Taskmaster. Weirdly, this episode is entirely bloop free....NOT. If you thought we'd learned everything there is to know about the city of Wells....well...you'd be wrong. There's been another Wells-related bloop.

Jack will be rigorously rubbing his statistical crystal balls as he brings together 60 episodes of cutting-edge analysis to find out who's got the best chance of winning the next series of Taskmaster UK. Please, for the love of God, don't place any money on him being right. It's bloop time once more and to be honest we're still recovering from the earth-shattering Godliman/Knappet affair from last week.

What an extraordinary guest we have for you this week. The absolutely delightful Nina Oyama will be joining us all the way from the other side of the planet to discuss failure, secrets and humiliation (a typical Tuesday night out for me) and answer the question on every listener's lips, what are Jack's babies made out of? The Andys are back with a vengeance to dispel myths and start a few of their own and of course Lou and Jack are tearing apart the latest episode and gobbling up any morsel of opinion that falls out. Plus, Lou has been sniffing around the back of time and found a little sclusie of her own.

Boy oh boy what a treat we have for you this week. The excellent Australian Taskmaster's assistant Tom Cashman joins us to talk about everything from what makes him cry, Tom Gleeson's off screen persona, tasks that will never be broadcast, was he breast fed and most importantly his ass or cash preference. Jack is celebrating our 50th episode by looking back at his statistical highlights in order to create THE GREATEST TASKMASTER CONTESTANT EVER SEEN. Press play to hear what freakish Frankenstein creation he's fabricated. If you want to share your Taskmaster obsession, whether it's talking about your favourite task, what you loved from the latest episode or that you once ground a pirated Taskmaster 'Best of' DVD into a fine powder and rubbed it on your gums to act as a performance enhancing drug for your annual office review, we're all ears.

We're joined by the wonderful Sam Smith (not that one) who is the task writer for the New Zealand and Australian Taskmasters as well as a warm up act and all round bloody nice guy. We discuss inspiration, perspiration and even a little defecation as Sam pulls back the curtains on the machine that is Taskmaster. Jack is welcoming in the Chinese New Year with a cornucopia of facts and stats about the Chinese Zodiac, mainly supplied by Ayden, a self-identifying snake (their words not mine). Can horses handle the pressure? Is this the time for rabbits to shine? Was Jack born in 1964? All will be revealed. If you want to share your Taskmaster obsession, whether it's talking about your favourite task, what you loved from the latest episode or that you've recently engineered an ICO for a Taskmaster themed cryptocurrency called HorneCoin, we're all ears.

Then it must be because we have Taskmaster's very own music maestro, Dru Masters on this week. Jack, Lou and Dru discuss his influences, process, childhood and most importantly the damning lack of cowbells in the Taskmaster Soundtrack. If that wasn't enough, Jack is also at the cutting edge of topicality discussing inflation. Not the terrifying type that you hear about in the news though, he's talking Greg's point inflation over the series and has a go at redressing this despicable generosity.
