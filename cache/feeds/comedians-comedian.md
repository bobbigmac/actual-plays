In this candid conversation, we discuss how she unexpectedly found her true calling, paving the way for “Trigger Warning”, a deeply powerful show rooted in the horrors committed against her and the lack of available help, which she nonetheless navigates with sensitivity, warmth and humour. We also talk about the addictive nature of comedy, its impact on personal happiness, and whether one can find contentment regardless of gig outcomes. As an advocate for mental health, Harriet opens up about her role in running \"Barking Tales\" and the impact of neurodiversity on her comedic authenticity.

      "description": "Co-host of The Dollop podcast and a superb comic and improviser, Gareth Reynolds is touring the UK right now! In this gold-standard episode we talk about his improv characterisation, the history of his collaboration with Dave Anthony, and how taking “The Dollop Pill” has gradually changed everything he thought he knew about America. We also get into the “robust mental health triumvirate” of improv, sports analogies and regular income, and explore his YouTube series “Ga’riffs”, in which he heroically improvised stand-up on previously-unseen audience suggestions to camera, alone in the room. 25 mins of unmissable extras available only to the Insiders Club include Gareth going deeper on the techniques and structures he employs while riffing, and exploring the fertile parallels between theatre sports, improv on-stage and crowd-work.

He returns to the podcast to talk in depth about the creative process behind the writing of that show, the inciting incident in which a bread roll was thrown at him at a charity gig, and how that led to a media frenzy, terrifying death threats, and ultimately a total re-evaluation of his mental health.

We discuss her honest and frank writing style and processes – both in writing for herself whether it be stage or TV and for other characters – who come through to her via dead peoples’ spirits. We also delve into her love/hate relationship with stand-up and the prejudice and misogyny she experienced early on in her career, leading her to take a hiatus from performing.

      "description": "Trigger warning: Discussion of child sexual abuse. Jonny Pelham has become one of the most disarmingly hilarious comics in the UK by building his punchlines on a bedrock of unflinching honesty. There’s a big difference between the comedy cliche of “saying the unsayable”, and being able to find the humanity and authenticity in a subject that people don’t want to talk about. We talk about his new Edinburgh Fringe show “Optimism Over Despair”, and he leads us through the experience at that show’s core: his reflections over using his set on Live At The Apollo to discuss the sexual abuse he experienced as a child. We also learn about his clinical “maladaptive daydreaming”, and what it’s like to always come with a trigger warning. 20mins of *double trigger-warning* extras available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Jonny on a joke that he’s always found too dark to make work, but which says something very important about his experiences; how he makes the personal political; and how to make biographical work what you want it to be in the face of algorithmic soup!

We also explore comedy as a separate language, and the different dialects and fluency that we all employ… 20mins of extra content available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Ignacio on neurodiversity, and the hyper-focus that means he can’t put down a book before finishing it, as well as how he parlayed his viral Rhianna parody song into the core of a social media strategy.

An engineer in a previous life, and a comic tour de force in this one, Gina's boldness and clarity of mind saw her draft up a plan: simply selling up her life in the UK and moseying over to the ol' USA. We examine Gina's annoyance at being the 'diversity' on panel shows, point the finger firmly in the direction of The Patriarchy, and discuss the myriad of pitfalls involved with plunging oneself headlong into starting afresh elsewhere.

As principled as they come – punitively politically correct, and forever eschewing the same limelight in which other contemporaries love to bathe – we ponder the lengths to which he is willing to go in order to gleefully burn bridges. We also discuss what the autumn of his career might have in store, and explore how the righteousness of his onstage persona forbids any apologies... just how heavy is the head that wears the crown Comedy Police helmet ?

Thrill, as you discover how he’s driven to this prodigious comedy output by an almost pathological fear of being told off by an audience for not trying hard enough!

As well as talking about her comedy origins as a support act for Josie Long and Robin Ince and her work with The Guilty Feminist podcast, we discover the peace she’s made with her impostor syndrome, and get deeply involved in the responsibility she feels to look inside herself and to not deny people their feelings. 22mins of extras available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Grace on how she maintains her activism in the face of criticism and despair, and we learn the transferable skills between writing a protest song and a standup routine… Go to www.comedianscomedian.com/insiders for ad-free episodes, extra content from every show that has it, and much more - including the exclusive Insiders Q&As with Nish Kumar, Alfie Brown, James Acaster and Fern Brady, plus the incredible “self-help for comedians” special with Amanda Donnet.

We talk about her incredible new Edinburgh show “Wet”, and why it’s no longer simply about a fight during an aqua aerobics class. We also cover her excellent shame-beating podcast “Wheel of Misfortune”; the challenge of keeping oneself emotionally secure when making comedy out of pain; and how to be powerful. 25 mins of extras available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club include Alison on her earliest material that made her feel like herself; the journey of her expressing her mental health honestly; the importance or not of doing “reps” in comedy; and the non-comedy-related quality that got her where she is… Go to www.comedianscomedian.com/insiders for ad-free episodes, extra content from every show that has it, and much more - including the exclusive Insiders Q&As with Nish Kumar, Alfie Brown, James Acaster and Fern Brady, plus the incredible “self-help for comedians” special with Amanda Donnet.

The star of “Eric & Ernie” (BBC), Black Mirror’s “Waldo” episode, and Donald in Will Sharpe’s amazing “Flowers” (CH4), Daniel is dipping his toe back into standup after years away. In an episode Stu describes as “absolute ComCom-Bait”, Daniel discusses having no self-esteem despite being good at everything (Stu’s words not his), and how casting directors can smell that he’s an “angry weirdo”. We dig into creativity, dread, anxiety, and why there’s more of him than he intended in his book’s ultra-nihilist protagonist… 25mins of extras available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Daniel on the immense responsibility he felt when asked as a young comic to portray the legendary Eric Morecambe on screen; manufacturing a middle class “bumble” to disguise his working class background; and trying to focus on the journey of standup rather than the destination.

From possibly the world’s most terrifying first gig - shoved onstage by a comedian friend at a sold-out Hackney Empire - to just recently selling out the London Palladium by himself, we talk about faking it til you make it, serving and deserving the community, and the tension between his natural humility and the swagger required to kick down doors… 20mins of extra content available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Slim on whether connecting with audiences is a teachable skill, a lovely analogy about comics as salespeople and what represents a “good sale”, whether there’s a downside to doing your learning on a different circuit, and the decisions that went into his Live At The Apollo set.

      "description": "In this edited special edition, as Stu interviewed Jimmy live on stage during his “Terribly Funny” tour shows in Manchester, Birmingham and Cardiff, Stu navigates deftly between celebrity anecdotes to push Jimmy into territory which he’s a little less familiar with sharing. We talk about how parenthood may or may not change the way Jimmy works; discover what religion gets right about forgiveness; get knee deep in Jimmy's tax affairs; learn about his anxiety disorder; and find out why no-one needs a kid with a C in physics.

      "description": "He’s back, he’s bad, and he’s pulled off one of the most surprising pivots of the pandemic: writing an incredibly useful and heartfelt self-help book, masquerading as an autobiography! In this edited special edition, as Stu interviewed Jimmy live on stage during his “Terribly Funny” tour shows in Manchester, Birmingham and Cardiff, Stu navigates deftly between celebrity anecdotes to push Jimmy into territory which he’s a little less familiar with sharing. In part one Jimmy talks about his friend and colleague the late Sean Lock; goes into real detail on his favourite heckles and his strategy for combative comedy roasts; and reveals his deep relationship with his late mother, and how her passing affected the rest of his family.

We uncover their creative, scripting and filming processes, examine their position as “permanent underdogs”, and as we dive further into how they pool their personal ambition, we happen upon one of the best thing’s Stu has ever heard… 40 mins of scorchingly good extra content available exclusively to the Insiders Club includes FA&H sharing their own homemade vocabulary of sketch-writing terms, including “The Matrix’, “The Swan-dive”, “Chris-Rocking” and more!

As well as his deeply alt roots and proclivity to experiment with comedy forms, he is also a master of the internally collapsing vox pop, pushing through the soul-crushing rejections to a place of genuine brilliance.

      "description": "CW: Discussion of transphobia by people who aren’t affected by it. Adam Rowe is a killer. Huge punchlines, banging material that draws screams and whoops from his crowd, and a laser-like focus on achieving his ambitions. But what does his urge to defend controversial opinions for fun cost him, or indeed his audience? We talk at length about whether or not his “Victoria’s Secret” routine is transphobic, and whether getting the laugh is more important than a moral or ethical stance. We also cover whether aiming to be the best is enough to stay happy, the origins of his very shrewd “Club Comic” special, and where his drive comes from. 30 mins of extras available exclusively to the Insiders Club features Adam on the smash hit success of his and Dan Nightingale’s “Have A Word” podcast; some great insights into his writing process; and why he assumes he has ADHD.

Go to www.comedianscomedian.com/insiders for this and much more, including the exclusive Insiders Q&As with Nish Kumar, James Acaster and Alfie Brown, and your invite to the forthcoming ones with Fern Brady and a “self-help for comedians” special with Amanda Donnet (MClinPsych) Connect with Josh Johnson : https://www.joshjohnsoncomedy.com/ https://www.instagram.com/joshjohnsoncomedy/ https://twitter.com/joshjohnson https://www.facebook.com/JoshJComedy https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLuYADJ6hESLHX87JnsGbjA Hosted on Acast.

We talk about her relentless documentation of her life as a means of seeking permanence, the tragic death of her brother in 2019 - how she processed it, and the effect it had on her creativity - as well as her recent Soho On Demand special “Sunrise”, filmed in Corona to an audience of her sister BeBe, and her new novel “Sunset”. * Content warning: Sexual assault * 15 mins of extra content available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Jessie on how her membership of the Harry Potter franchise has a legacy of fandom that isn’t always useful to her as an independent artist, and how the Cave Sisters Patreon has changed her relationship with elements of her following.

Along the way we’ll find out why the perfect show will never happen, and why a fear of failure turns most magicians into “hack copycats”… 30 mins of extra content available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Piff on the invention of his own tricks, and how something new with a block of jelly has already cost him two and half years and over $70,000; how own bad magic and guilty shortcuts; his evangelist uprising; and what comics can learn from magicians.

Comedy-adjacent public historian, writer of “Dead Famous” and other superb books, and creator and host of “You’re Dead To Me” (BBC Sounds) Greg Jenner had factual oversight on every word of Horrible Histories ever recorded, and wrote some of the jokes too. He’s also a student of ComCom and probably our most learned ever guest… We talk about his creative process in constructing analogies that package and frame his research; learn about the pitfalls of generalising and the responsibility of the historian; and he shares his deeply personal struggle with mental health, anxiety and extraordinary insomnia, and they effect they still have on his fraught relationship with celebrity. 30 mins of extra content available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Greg delving further into his anxieties, particularly those that accrete around social media and listener feedback; the joy of online kindness; “factoids” and his doomed quest to rid the internet of viral “fake facts”; and we learn about the hidden link between Rattus Rattus from Horrible Histories and Greg himself.

It’d be great if the answer was “neither” wouldn’t it? But it’s clearly both.

And if you think that sounds pretentious you’re going to love the rest… We talk about calling bullshit on emotional manipulation, his slow climb back to normality after a youth inflected with OCD and depression, as well as the seductive narrative of victimhood…. Also seducing your mum. 35 minutes of extra content available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club includes Jordan on the arduous process of making his hit show “Bleed”, which did something incredibly new at imaginative, at some cost; the cultural race to expose more and more weakness and suffering over which comedy seems to obsess, and his mixed feelings about the award win.

His MSG-loving, rice-reviewing, phone-case wearing archetypical Asian uncle character has seen Nigel Ng jump from 20,000 to 2.8M YouTube subscribers during the pandemic. Now he returns after only a few months to talk about what winning the YouTube lottery has taught him. We talk about how he'd prepared the field for explosive growth, and how much of it was luck; how it feels to become a professional YouTuber; how he manages collaboration; what new challenges laid in wait for him; and whether his success would be repeatable in an alternate universe...

From sneaking into B&Q dressed as staff (engaging with the customers and sometimes not even recording it), to his brilliant new podcast “Futile Attempts”, we find a man relentless in his integrity and experimentation, but sometimes adrift from the comedy community and the wider world. We learn the sometimes devastating effect of his constant recording on his personal life; find out how his mum felt about his possible exploitation of his dementia-suffering father; and talk about innocence, terror, and overstepping the line. 30 minutes of extra content, available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club, includes Kim on his most recent “meltdown”; a meta chat about the pros and cons of his notion to record his appearance on the podcast and take control of the audio; the story behind “Noble and Silver” and why they split… and dread.

From fringe comedian to celebrity quizzer as “The Sinnerman” on The Chase (ITV), to a memorable appearance on Taskmaster (Dave) which came just as he was diagnosing himself with Parkinson’s disease, we catch up on how his comedy has metamorphosed from political agitation to personal story-telling. We cover how the mainstream-ification of his audiences changed his comedy; how he lost a friend to Covid-19 but managed to survive a devastating dose himself; what expectations he has of his life from now on; and why he’s a better comedian now than he’s ever been… 30 minutes of extra content, available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club, includes Paul on how he refuses to think about mortality, his new style of joke-writing on Twitter, and the inside story on his performance on Taskmaster… Go to www.comedianscomedian.com/insiders for this and much much more.

It matters not as we meet Helen Zaltzman; podcasting matriarch, mentor of Stu’s, co-host with Olly Mann of “Answer Me This”, host of the brilliant “Allusionist” podcast on the Radiotopia network, and very funny lady indeed. We talk about her comedy origins as Josie Long’s embroiderer, her childhood and the positives of knowing she was an unplanned baby, and setting one’s own parameters for success. We also talk about language as a means of understanding the world, overcoming her own pedantry and forgiving it in others, how she wrote a successful tour show in less than a day, and why you’re Namaste-ing all wrong… 25 mins of extra content available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club include a dive into the origins of Helen and Olly Mann’s “Answer Me This” podcast; how they cultivated the community now 14 years deep into their show (and passing it on to their own children), and how they broke new ground with the sorts of creative and marketing tactics that these days would make up a TED Talk.

We talk about how he made his obsession into his art, from renting and re-renting DVDs of the greats as a youth, to opening for Trevor Noah on world tours. We also cover re-learning how to socialise outside the industry, and the long road to making comedy out of the suicide attempt of a family member… 25 mins worth of extras available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Robby going into detail on the lessons he learnt from opening for Trevor Noah and Dave Chapelle, how to make an audience come to you, and how to cut out all the waiting time between thought and performance.

This former wealth manager and government policy maker is now a successful TV comedian with a significant career in the making. We talk about his very precise ambitions and his fascination with the absolute freedom of the stage, as well as his disappointment in finding out that comedy is no longer anti-establishment and that comedians are “a precious bunch”. We also touch on Eshaan’s suicide attempt, and get stuck into the tremendous difficulty of exploring a serious emotional topic using comedy. *Content warning: mention of suicide* In 30 mins of extras available only to the Insiders Club, Eshaan outlines some fascinating and unique parallels with comedy from his former careers. He portrays different types of jokes by comparing them to bitcoin, treasury bonds and investments (which if you already know about jokes works neatly as a primer in finance) and explores links between policy making and comedy, via analysis of two very different ideas about “audience”.

We talk about how his persona changed from open mics to big rooms, and how he strove for authenticity, despite the looming feeling that something was missing from his impressive TV career. Just when this outsider among outsiders seemed finally about to break big, in 2018 he appeared on Strictly Come Dancing (BBC) and pictures surfaced of him kissing his dance partner. We discuss the tabloid uproar and the accusations that followed, and the effect they had on his life and work. 40mins of extras available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club include Seann on being unsettled by the aggressive environment on panel shows, getting kicked out of college and the cosiness of melancholy; his unique DIY technique for ridding oneself of nervous energy pre-show; and why any future set on Conan (TBS) will be very different to his first one...

      "description": "A juggernaut of charisma and filth, Ninia Benjamin has a supernatural connection to her audience and a mind like a firework display. We discuss why she won’t ever explain her race or size, only her point of view, and how she moved beyond the onstage anger that used to motivate her. We also dig deep into her career rebirth after an ‘annus horribilis’ brought about by professional struggles and her own impostor syndrome. This far into her career, can she finally accept herself as a “proper comedian”? Extras include Ninia on writing for Aladdin and what she sang to Will Smith, a deep-dive into why she identifies writing comedy with “homework”, and a full on pep-talk from Stu about exactly how she should attack the Edinburgh festival… Access them, and all other extra content, by singing up the Insiders Club at www.comedianscomedian.com/insiders IG: @ninia_benjamin | TW: @ninia_benjamin Get tickets for Stu's tour : 01/02/20 Newcastle Stand (early show – 5pm) 02/02/20 Glasgow – The Stand 07/02/20 Farnham Maltings 11/02/20 York – The Basement 12/02/20 Leeds – Hyde Park Book Club 28/02/20 Cambridge Junction Hosted on Acast.

We talk about the pressures of keeping up hit-rate within routines, and get technical about top-lines, and why he wants the premise of a bit to be more intelligent than he is himself. But what happens when you lose sight of your goals in the process of following the next apparently logical step? 30 mins of extras available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Jamali going deep into the production of his Vice TV smash \"Hate Thy Neighbour\", which saw him write an hour of comedy in three days, sixteen times, whilst avoiding being killed by neo-Nazis. We also cover how to extract laughter from horrific things, and find the fertile ground between outrage and consensus...

Ordinarily reluctant to talk about his alter-ego, Gregg gradually uncovers his love for outsider art, and the qualities he considers genius. We learn about the origins of Neil in prank phone calls and fake live shows, the comedy he can't stand and why, and the utterly original concept behind his live albums. Over 30mins of extra content available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club include Gregg on being booed onto the stage supporting Tenacious D at Reading Festival, and how it meant no more to him than a crowd at Madison Square Garden chanting his name! We also learn the surprising basis to whom he won't attack and why, and find out why he considers interviews pointless...

He is also constantly referred to as a co-founder of the enormously significant Upright Citizens Brigade, which arguably serves him right for co-founding it. We take a deep dive into the genesis of the Chicago improv scene, learn about Del Close and his influence on everything that was to follow, and argue about Keith Johnstone. Matt also dissects his own bad habits in improv, ponders the relativity of success, and identifies the one type of comic he won't perform with... Matt Besser's brand new stand-up special \"Pot Humour\" is out now on Apple/iTunes, Amazon, DirectTV VOD, Spectrum VOD, Xbox and pretty much every VOD platform you might use.

We talk about how he found himself drowning in stand-up, and clawed his way back to shore through developing his live work for the internet. We also discuss proving one isn't \"a YouTuber\", the \"restrictive freedom\" of comedy, and whether he's a real pariah or just a wannabe... 30mins of extra content available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club includes Chris on his contemporaries from the early days and what it feels like now there are \"more freaks than bros\" in comedy; his mantra for self-confidence; some more powerful insights into the nature of online comedy; and what he'd do if the internet broke.

We talk about their first Edinburgh and how they snatched victory from the jaws of a 10 month old baby, explore their solo work, including Zach's \" Jack Tucker \" character and his unique relationship with live direction and sound cues, and discuss breaking the rules, winding the Late N Live audience up on purpose, and getting good at being bad.

We also dive into the delicate balance between trauma, therapy and confessional shows, and the mistake she made that she was too late in noticing to fix...

      "description": "I said it and I'm sticking with it: Russell Hicks is a risk-taking ball of fire. Making a conscious choice to bet the house on every gig, he eschews material in favour of 100% riffing, with explosive results. We explore the economic consequences of approaching a set like a game of pinball in an industry based on reliability, dig into his use of comic muscle memory, and find out why he paints on a cave wall and not a canvas... Extra material available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club includes Russell on why he chose the UK over America, how it felt to be told he wouldn't succeed whilst succeeding, and the suggestion other comics always make to him... and why he ignores it. Join up at www.comedianscomedian.com/insiders Find Russell's comedy album, consisting of three different hours recorded in Edinburgh 2016 at www.russellhicks.co.uk See my show Primer at this year's Edinburgh Fringe @ComComPod | www.comedianscomedian.com Hosted on Acast.

We explore how he sees one-liners as \".zip\" files, using punchy gags into which he's compressed huge ideas, and learn how he attempts to safeguard his precarious mental health, particularly with regard to the loneliness of the job. 20 mins of extra content available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club includes Ahir on his survival tips for small scale touring, the strategy behind his switch from the free to the paid fringe this year, and the thought he'll keep in mind when appearing shortly on \"Have I Got News For You\".

But something was wrong; she became physically and mentally exhausted and felt increasingly detached from her onstage persona. Now starring in “Curfew” on Sky, we talk about the warning signs she saw and missed, why she wouldn't do another panel show if she returned to standup, and whether it's easier or harder to be depressed in L.A.

But in May 2017 a provocative promo image of her holding the severed \"head\" of President Donald Trump changed her life forever. We talk about how she survived having the machinery of state directed towards bullying her, when a Department of Justice investigation into \"conspiracy to assassinate the President\" led to her entire working life being cancelled. As you'll hear, the President's admitted attempt to \"decimate her life\" has only strengthened the resolve of this astonishingly powerful woman... We also talk about sexism, marketing, seizing the means of production, and banging Tarantino!

The first free fringe act to be nominated for Best Newcomer at the Edinburgh Festival, appearing shortly afterwards on Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow, it looked as if the world was at his feet. But he is the first to admit he didn't capitalise on his success, and now takes a forensic approach to the business decisions and alliances he regrets. We talk about how his previous job in the video-games industry affects his quality control; uncover the dynamic between his work ethic and an \"internal unworthiness\", and discover his voracious attitude to personal development... www.imranyusuf.com @ImranYusuf Enjoy all extras from shows past and present with access to the private Insiders Club podcast, alongside a host of other strands and projects, including the chance to interview Stu yourself, and take part in a group critical analysis of newer acts from all over the world: www.comedianscomedian.com/insiders Stu’s 2019 tour of “End Of” has just gone on sale! “A comedy masterclass… Endlessly inventive” (The List) Tickets for the first half of the tour at these links: 22/02/2019 Maidenhead – Norden Farm 01/03/2019 Falmouth – The Poly 13/03/2019 Salisbury Art Centre 20/03/2019 Cheltenham Playhouse 29/03/2019 Crawley -The Hawth 05/04/2019 Reading – South Street Arts 12/04/2019 Leamington Spa - Royal Spa Centre 17/04/2019 Oxford Old Fire Station 19/04/2019 Bromsgrove – The Artix 27/04/2019 Plymouth Barbican Hosted on Acast.

She also talks about her activism, how her parents \"raised a quitter\", and turns out to be surprisingly well-informed on British comedy...

But is he really \"solicitous and pandering\"?

We explore how the Fringe has changed, trace his career via the Channel Four sketch show \"Absolutely\", and resulting spin-off \"Mr Don & Mr George\", and discover his frustrations on hosting the chatshow that was a Channel 5 flagship. We also unpack which absurdist elements of Jack's improvisation are too much for TV...

      "description": "Variety superstar Clarke MacFarlane blends elements of stand-up, clowning and skills to create the show-stopping, crowd-surfing \"Mario, Queen of the Circus\". Touring with La Clique and La Soiree has allowed him to hone his act to perfection over years, but he still \"pays his dues\" with regular streetshows. We discuss his work rate and workaholism, his respect for standups, and his bizarre pre-performance habits, not to mention the dark voices that plague even a top level act such as himself.
