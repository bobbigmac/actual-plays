We discuss Alan’s choice to open up onstage for the first time about his traumatic childhood , the breakthrough moment when a WIP becomes “a real show”, the trick to building momentum with monkey bars, how writing offered Alan emotional relief as well as a record for the future and why when dishonesty is everywhere, being honest matters .

      "description": "Join me as we remember the incredible Dr Janey Godley. If you've enjoyed this episode, you can donate to The Prince & Princess of Wales Hospice . We talk about how she thrived despite abuse, poverty and alcoholism in her upbringing; detail her absolute conviction in the power of honesty; and learn how an early experience at the Edinburgh Fringe led her to reject the comedy industry and focus instead on her audience. CW: We talk about abuse Janey suffered as a child, at the very start of this show, and throughout. This episode was originally released in March 2020.

We also talk about the addictive nature of comedy, its impact on personal happiness, and whether one can find contentment regardless of gig outcomes.

Jonny Pelham has become one of the most disarmingly hilarious comics in the UK by building his punchlines on a bedrock of unflinching honesty. There’s a big difference between the comedy cliche of “saying the unsayable”, and being able to find the humanity and authenticity in a subject that people don’t want to talk about. We talk about his new Edinburgh Fringe show “Optimism Over Despair”, and he leads us through the experience at that show’s core: his reflections over using his set on Live At The Apollo to discuss the sexual abuse he experienced as a child. We also learn about his clinical “maladaptive daydreaming”, and what it’s like to always come with a trigger warning. 20mins of *double trigger-warning* extras available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Jonny on a joke that he’s always found too dark to make work, but which says something very important about his experiences; how he makes the personal political; and how to make biographical work what you want it to be in the face of algorithmic soup!

We also discuss her secret fears that she’s doing some kind of TEDTalk and can’t write proper jokes; about main character syndrome and the “fraud cycle”; and why people will be commenting “one of the boys!” under everything she ever puts out, for the rest of her life… 15mins of extra content available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Michelle on her interaction with strangers after the powerful energy that suffuses “Average Bear”, and how she safeguards herself in such intimate connections, and her unique perspective on clowning, chaos, and exactly what makes the Aunty Donna boys such special little guys… Go to www.comedianscomedian.com/insiders for all this, plus ad-free episodes, extra content from every show that has it, and more!

We revisit his earliest shows, speculate as to what drives him to apply a much sterner standard to himself than anyone else, and find out what it means to him that “Mock The Week” has concluded… 20mins of extras available exclusively to the Insiders Club include how many notes Glenn has on his app in the run up to Edinburgh (clue, it’s more than a thousand!) , we talk paradigm-shifts in comedy, and he shares with us some of his recent bad ideas.

As well as talking about her comedy origins as a support act for Josie Long and Robin Ince and her work with The Guilty Feminist podcast, we discover the peace she’s made with her impostor syndrome, and get deeply involved in the responsibility she feels to look inside herself and to not deny people their feelings. 22mins of extras available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Grace on how she maintains her activism in the face of criticism and despair, and we learn the transferable skills between writing a protest song and a standup routine… Go to www.comedianscomedian.com/insiders for ad-free episodes, extra content from every show that has it, and much more - including the exclusive Insiders Q&As with Nish Kumar, Alfie Brown, James Acaster and Fern Brady, plus the incredible “self-help for comedians” special with Amanda Donnet.

      "description": "A uniquely nuanced voice in comedy, the riotously imaginative Tom Ward balances gleeful absorption in the creative process and robustly-managed mental health. Destined to become a fan favourite, this episode sees Tom sensitively exploring: why comics with certainty make him suspicious; his internal landscape and how he copes with the non-triggered meltdowns occasioned by his Complex PTSD; and how his careful devotion to doing one thing at a time impacts his creativity. He also uses a burner phone so he can’t get distracted whilst writing… •chef’s kiss• 25 mins of extra content available exclusively to the Insiders Club includes Tom on the therapeutic value of comedy for good or ill; how his stolen Casio beats keep his ambiguity accessible; and the shared desire to write “a joke so good that he doesn’t die alone”.

We outline his journey from an angry young man who either needed “a hug or a slap”, through the transformative effects of both being onstage and getting proper therapy, to a towering performer with gigs at the Palladium, Sydney Opera House and the Royal Albert Hall under his belt. We also discover his conscious effort to maintain eye contact; how he became more reliable to bookers; and whether tall people come across as angry when they’re just animated… 25 mins of extra content available exclusively to the Insiders Club includes Sean’s reaction to sharing a name with one of the most famous people on the internet; and advice for comics starting tour support, which Sean has done at the highest level, from Sydney Opera House to the Royal Albert Hall, in service of comics like Bill Burr, Katherine Ryan and Ricky Gervais.

The star of “Eric & Ernie” (BBC), Black Mirror’s “Waldo” episode, and Donald in Will Sharpe’s amazing “Flowers” (CH4), Daniel is dipping his toe back into standup after years away. In an episode Stu describes as “absolute ComCom-Bait”, Daniel discusses having no self-esteem despite being good at everything (Stu’s words not his), and how casting directors can smell that he’s an “angry weirdo”. We dig into creativity, dread, anxiety, and why there’s more of him than he intended in his book’s ultra-nihilist protagonist… 25mins of extras available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Daniel on the immense responsibility he felt when asked as a young comic to portray the legendary Eric Morecambe on screen; manufacturing a middle class “bumble” to disguise his working class background; and trying to focus on the journey of standup rather than the destination.

Prizing structure and organisation, her usually ferocious output hiccupped when she was traumatised by the loss of live work during the pandemic. Back in the saddle now, we talk about focusing on YouTube as an audience-builder, being told “we’ve already got one like you”, and how to be your own agent. But are there really “lots of reasons for people to hate her”? 20 mins of extra content available exclusively to the Insiders Club includes Diane on whether she’s always been so mentally robust; how she coped with being booed offstage; and how she feels when contributions from her comedian husband Kevin Shepherd get laughs… Go to www.comedianscomedian.com/insiders for this and much more, including the exclusive Insiders Q&As with Nish Kumar, James Acaster and Fern Brady and the incredible “self-help for comedians” special with Amanda Donnet.

      "description": "A quite brilliant stand-up, with gloriously unique and surprising one-liners, Aaron Chen started comedy incredibly young, and was already working to shed every ounce of hackery while still in his teens. As well as his deeply alt roots and proclivity to experiment with comedy forms, he is also a master of the internally collapsing vox pop, pushing through the soul-crushing rejections to a place of genuine brilliance. We talk about his early experiments with ultra-awkwardness, his astounding YouTube figures, why he searches for the one-line joke in every story, and discover why he never performs in Chinese, despite his huge Chinese audience.

Huge punchlines, banging material that draws screams and whoops from his crowd, and a laser-like focus on achieving his ambitions. But what does his urge to defend controversial opinions for fun cost him, or indeed his audience? We talk at length about whether or not his “Victoria’s Secret” routine is transphobic, and whether getting the laugh is more important than a moral or ethical stance. We also cover whether aiming to be the best is enough to stay happy, the origins of his very shrewd “Club Comic” special, and where his drive comes from. 30 mins of extras available exclusively to the Insiders Club features Adam on the smash hit success of his and Dan Nightingale’s “Have A Word” podcast; some great insights into his writing process; and why he assumes he has ADHD.

This masterful young US comic never stops working and is reaping the benefits with a place in the Daily Show writers' room, and two brand new releases: his own music/comedy collaboration \"Mixtape\", and his debut special \"# (Hashtag)\". We encounter a really thoughtful approach to his art, and talk about his possibly unique combination of comedy and non-comic original music; explore embellishment; and how \"playing to his weakness\" serves his material... 20ish minutes of extra content available exclusively to Insiders as Josh ruminates on vulnerabilities, approach, and how not even the most vexatious of Uber drivers can knock back the offer of free fried chicken. Go to www.comedianscomedian.com/insiders for this and much more, including the exclusive Insiders Q&As with Nish Kumar, James Acaster and Alfie Brown, and your invite to the forthcoming ones with Fern Brady and a “self-help for comedians” special with Amanda Donnet (MClinPsych) Connect with Josh Johnson : https://www.joshjohnsoncomedy.com/ https://www.instagram.com/joshjohnsoncomedy/ https://twitter.com/joshjohnson https://www.facebook.com/JoshJComedy https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLuYADJ6hESLHX87JnsGbjA Hosted on Acast.

Along the way we’ll find out why the perfect show will never happen, and why a fear of failure turns most magicians into “hack copycats”… 30 mins of extra content available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Piff on the invention of his own tricks, and how something new with a block of jelly has already cost him two and half years and over $70,000; how own bad magic and guilty shortcuts; his evangelist uprising; and what comics can learn from magicians.

Comedy-adjacent public historian, writer of “Dead Famous” and other superb books, and creator and host of “You’re Dead To Me” (BBC Sounds) Greg Jenner had factual oversight on every word of Horrible Histories ever recorded, and wrote some of the jokes too. He’s also a student of ComCom and probably our most learned ever guest… We talk about his creative process in constructing analogies that package and frame his research; learn about the pitfalls of generalising and the responsibility of the historian; and he shares his deeply personal struggle with mental health, anxiety and extraordinary insomnia, and they effect they still have on his fraught relationship with celebrity. 30 mins of extra content available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Greg delving further into his anxieties, particularly those that accrete around social media and listener feedback; the joy of online kindness; “factoids” and his doomed quest to rid the internet of viral “fake facts”; and we learn about the hidden link between Rattus Rattus from Horrible Histories and Greg himself.

It’d be great if the answer was “neither” wouldn’t it? But it’s clearly both.

His MSG-loving, rice-reviewing, phone-case wearing archetypical Asian uncle character has seen Nigel Ng jump from 20,000 to 2.8M YouTube subscribers during the pandemic.

We learn the sometimes devastating effect of his constant recording on his personal life; find out how his mum felt about his possible exploitation of his dementia-suffering father; and talk about innocence, terror, and overstepping the line. 30 minutes of extra content, available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club, includes Kim on his most recent “meltdown”; a meta chat about the pros and cons of his notion to record his appearance on the podcast and take control of the audio; the story behind “Noble and Silver” and why they split… and dread.

From fringe comedian to celebrity quizzer as “The Sinnerman” on The Chase (ITV), to a memorable appearance on Taskmaster (Dave) which came just as he was diagnosing himself with Parkinson’s disease, we catch up on how his comedy has metamorphosed from political agitation to personal story-telling. We cover how the mainstream-ification of his audiences changed his comedy; how he lost a friend to Covid-19 but managed to survive a devastating dose himself; what expectations he has of his life from now on; and why he’s a better comedian now than he’s ever been… 30 minutes of extra content, available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club, includes Paul on how he refuses to think about mortality, his new style of joke-writing on Twitter, and the inside story on his performance on Taskmaster… Go to www.comedianscomedian.com/insiders for this and much much more.

It matters not as we meet Helen Zaltzman; podcasting matriarch, mentor of Stu’s, co-host with Olly Mann of “Answer Me This”, host of the brilliant “Allusionist” podcast on the Radiotopia network, and very funny lady indeed. We talk about her comedy origins as Josie Long’s embroiderer, her childhood and the positives of knowing she was an unplanned baby, and setting one’s own parameters for success. We also talk about language as a means of understanding the world, overcoming her own pedantry and forgiving it in others, how she wrote a successful tour show in less than a day, and why you’re Namaste-ing all wrong… 25 mins of extra content available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club include a dive into the origins of Helen and Olly Mann’s “Answer Me This” podcast; how they cultivated the community now 14 years deep into their show (and passing it on to their own children), and how they broke new ground with the sorts of creative and marketing tactics that these days would make up a TED Talk.

      "description": "The co-host and co-creator of Dara O Briain's Go 8 Bit, Steve McNeil started his career in sketch comedy, and has enjoyed an invigoratingly twisty journey through multiple genres, currently specialising as a twitch gamer and host, with new project #WiFiWars gathering momentum online as we speak. We talk about his pivot away from TV, the single most agonising factor that led to the demise of \"Go 8 Bit\", his new special \"Hey Listen!\" and his recent battles with his mental health. 30 mins of extra content available exclusively to members of the Insiders Club focuses Steve's tips and tricks for growing an audience on Twitch, and what comics can expect to find when trying to explore that fertile territory!

We talk about seeking connection, the protective shell of comedy, finding acceptance but to white standards, and why her tremendous debut poster was a literal collage of dick pics. 30 mins worth of extras available exclusively to the Insiders Club include Desiree’s very inspiring thoughts on being her own boss and recognising her own value, and a deep dive into her last show “Desiree’s Coming Early” which used a twin narrative to reframe her personal history, whilst being incredibly funny… As the live comedy circuit undergoes a painful transformation into some unknown new form, there HAS NEVER BEEN A BETTER TIME to keep the podcast alive and get hold of oodles of sweet extra content (including the new special episode about The Great Pivot with ComCom Consultant Pete Dobbing) with a regular subscription.
