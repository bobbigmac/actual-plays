      "description": "Dear listeners, It is with hearts filled with sadness and gratitude that we must announce the end of our journey. After a pretty amazing few years, the Stars Are Right podcast (and publishing) will be winding down over the next month or two. Don’t worry, we’re still aiming to finish the scenario we’re currently playing, though there might be one or two changes to the cast. The plan is for the last few episodes to continue to broadcast on their current schedule, and to stop going up in September at the conclusion of Dances of Vice, Horror, and Ecstasy . There was a slight delay in editing episode 22, so our Berlin campaign will resume next week - apologies! In the meantime, please enjoy a little side adventure coming your way this week. We’re very sad we won’t be able to round off our campaign with the third scenario from Berlin: The Wicked City as we originally intended, but an awful lot has changed in many of our lives over the last few months. Some of it has been great, some not so great, and we've definitely reached the end of our ability to make the show as we have been. Once the podcast wraps up, it will remain online for the foreseeable future - on all the platforms you’re currently using to listen for as long as we can afford it, and hopefully on Patreon longer than that. To assist with that, all the bonus Patreon content and Beyond the Madness episodes will, from September, be made available at a single, low-cost tier intended to pay for ongoing podcast and website hosting costs. All proceeds beyond those running costs will be donated to the charity Hope Not Hate . If you were intending to buy merch at some point then you might want to act quickly - we're not sure how long it'll continue to be available, when it's gone it’s gone! You can find links at starsareright.com and in the episode notes. We’re infinitely grateful for all of your support up to this point. You’ve helped turn what started as a wild pandemic lock-down dream into a project that’s spanned years of games, multiple bestselling publications, and a truly amazing community. We’re honestly amazed at how far we've come, so pleased with what we’ve made, and delighted it's been enjoyed by so many lovely people! Speaking of community, once things wrap up our discord server will be run by Jayson and Lydia as admins, and we hope will continue to be a lovely, friendly place to chat with fellow listeners and horror RPG fans, and even run your own games. If you're not already on there, do drop by and say hi! Stars Are Right may be ending, but in order to keep on bringing you the Call of Cthulhu content that we all love, Jayson and Lydia are developing a new podcast together. This will feature some familiar Stars Are Right voices, brand new scenario actual-plays, talk-show panels and much more - including a playthrough of Jayson’s upcoming Miskatonic Repository scenario, The Bride of Pendle. The new podcast’s team will share more details and links as soon as they are able. We hope you’ve enjoyed the ride, and continue to enjoy the remainder of our adventures. Thanks again from all of us, and may the omens be ever in your favour. Love from the Stars Are Right Founders, Phaedra, Braydon and Howl Website | Patreon | Merch | Discord",

      "description": "Wonderful cultists, The earliest part of 2024 has been a series of failed rolls that we’ve been continuing to try to Push, but unfortunately we’ve not always succeeded. There have been some critical successes as well as fumbles, though. First of all, the inimitable Braydon has, through fel magicks, brought his own new spawn into the universe. Join us in welcoming Reya (and admire her either on Discord or on our Patreon !) Gilly’s also had her own life changes, in the form of having to travel extensively for work this year! She’s consequently not able to join us on the regular for the next part of our Berlin campaign, but we’re sure you’ll join us in wishing her well on her adventures and hoping she can come back soon to play with us! Thus, we have had to make some changes in how we are doing things on our end, at least for the time being. Here’s the breakdown: We’ll be reducing our release frequency to every two weeks, rather than every week, in order to rebuild a buffer, and rush less with recording and editing. We’ll be tweaking our patreon offerings to make our bonus content more accessible. Beyond The Madness, our post-recording chit-chat show, will soon also be available at the Cult Initiate tier! The Cult Elder and Avatar tiers will continue to have exclusive access to our bonus game-play. This will soon include a second play-through of Alone Against the Static (for any completionists) and The Necropolis (run by Gilly, to help you not miss her too much!). The next adventure released will be The Exhibition of Dread, a spectral one-shot written by Jared Tallis and published by Stars Are Right. Berlin the Wicked City part 2 is currently being recorded and will be released after that, everything progressing smoothly, so get hyped! The idea behind this slowing down is for us to serve you the finest Deep One Steaks instead of mere soggy fishburgers, and to ensure that we can keep putting out the podcasts that you’ve all been loving. None of this would have been possible without you, and we appreciate the ongoing support that we have had over the years. Onwards and upwards, with many hopeful things on the horizon. Until the Stars are Right again…",
