      "description": "Top political comedian Matt Forde reconvenes his Focus Group for a Boxing Day special with a Dickensian twist. Recorded in front of a live audience, Matt is joined by journalists, comedians and politicians – including former Cabinet Minister Michael Gove – to review the political state we're in through the lens of Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Expect sharp analysis, unexpected confessions, and the year's biggest stories getting visited by the Ghosts of Politics Past, Present and Yet to Come. Appearing as a festive treat in BBC Radio 4's Friday Night Comedy feed, it's a topical comedy that's both genuinely funny and surprisingly insightful – perfect for digesting with the leftover turkey.

Covering international tensions, a UK General Election, and of course the question on everyone’s lips, what exactly was a ‘Brat Summer’? With Andy Zaltzman in the chair, full of whimsical animal metaphors and cricket stats, we’ll hear highlights from the crème de la crème of British and international comedy and journalism to dissect the news. It's a chance to return to, and revel in, some of 2024's funniest moments, starring Ian Smith, Lucy Porter, Geoff Norcott, Alasdair Beckett-King, Mark Steel, Ria Lina, Simon Evans and Zoe Lyons, amongst others. Come digest a dramatic year of news, along with the leftover turkey, as we say goodbye to 2024, goodbye to 14 years or Conservative rule, goodbye to short-lived presidential hopeful Kamala Harris, and goodbye to Earth’s temporary second moon.

This week, we find out which of the year's political memoirs passes our special test, and we ask the big Christmas question 'When Is Bins?' Expect festive advice, guests full of joy and wonder, and a little drummer boy (budget depending), as the show sticks its hand into all the Christmas current affairs, pulls out a bag of news-giblets and stuffs the airwaves with irreverent features, mischievous set-pieces and more jokes than you can shake a seasonal stick at.

Host Andrew Hunter Murray (No Such Thing As A Fish, QI Elf, Private Eye) will strip away the curtain and dive into not only the big stories, but also at the way in which the news is packaged and presented. From award-winning writers and a crack team of contemporary satirists - and recorded in front of a live audience - The Naked Week delivers a (consensual) topical news nude straight to your ears.

In a topical mash-up of prank calls, interviews and features, Dom Joly offers his mischievously surreal take on the people and stories that are hitting the week's headlines. As Dom attempts to get to the bottom of the biggest stories of the week, he challenges experts and makes calls to the wrong people about the wrong thing, often at the wrong time. Best known for Trigger Happy TV which reinvented the hidden camera format, Dom actually has a degree in politics and is a former diplomat. He once stood against Alan Clarke in the 1997 general election. So make no mistake, in Dom Joly Breaks the News, Dom’s asking serious questions about that week's actual news. He just wonders whether approaching things from a slightly different angle might give us more interesting answers.
