      "description": "Note from Lucas: I know some folks might have a difficult time with talking about Wendigo in fiction. I myself am Metis and the way it was discussed by elders was the Wendigo was a cautionary tale of anger, isolation, and pain. I tried to keep that in the spirit of the creature, but also reflect that at this point in the story they are fighting a boss fight designed in a video game, so there is a portion that is very gamified to it. I understand completely if this is an episode you'd like to skip. If you'd like to skip this episode but want to know what happens I am placing SPOILERS at the end of the show notes, so you have to scroll to see it. ************* Welcome to the Ballad of the Seven Dice. The party is now ready to at last confront the boss of Floor 1 alongside scores of other players! Will they take this creature down quickly or will they realize that Carcosa Online is one hell of a game!

YOU'VE BEEN WARNED The party heads into the forest with everyone, realizing that a winter has set over the woods. Akihiko asked Nysla about love as they head deeper in readying themselves. They set off their plan to trap the boss in the fire trap and a bit of it goes wrong with Lune losing a portion of his people and wishing it was him instead. The party fights and the battle is brutal with scores upon scores of people perishing. The boss is piercing players on its antlers and when they are on there, they don't truly die. Akihiko is almost slain and Houndman takes the hit and is killed. Nysla almost dies from a number of attacks and is unconscious. Lune criticals two times in a row and at the last moment defeats the boss. The party realizes they lost over 100 players in this battle and many dear friends. They are broken, battered, and scarred. This is the cost of victory.",

I'm glad to share with you the first part of our next patreon one shot, The Nostradamus Research Station. Here we join a group of guards and researchers who are working on a floor inside the massive Nostradamus Research Station. This single floor is the size of a large city and is a complete winter biome. The thing that makes this odd on top of that is that this floor is run by illithid and they take care of \"interesting\" creatures.

At Ctrlgroup we aim to show off the latest and greatest in the tabletop roleplaying game world. We play a plethora of systems using mini-campaigns to show you what's out there. We test the systems so you don't have to! If you like what you hear check out our other playtests: Monster of the Week: Tome of Mysteries, Pasión de las Pasiones, Lasers and Feelings! Everyone is playing two characters, it contains spoilers for the series, and that we tried to keep it as tame as possible as far as Game of Thrones goes. If you're looking at ways you can help the Black Lives Matter movement, go here and see a large amount of things you can do! https://blacklivesmatters.carrd.co/",
