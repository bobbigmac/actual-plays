# Speaker profiles

Optional per-speaker profile markdown files.

- Filenames are speaker slugs, e.g. `james-acaster.md`.
- Put a `# Title` as the first line to override the display name for that speaker page.
- Optional front matter is supported:

```
---
key: value
---
```

Everything after the first `# Title` line is rendered on the speaker page.
