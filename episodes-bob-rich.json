      "description": "Bob Mortimer is an English comedian, TV presenter, fisherman, author, podcaster, pork pie detective and 100% certified national treasure. He’s with us to chat about his new book, The Long Shoe, his third work of fiction following the successes of The Hotel Avocado and The Satsuma Complex. Bob has sold over 2 million books (and counting), crowning another significant chapter in his legendary career. \n\nBob first appeared on our screens in the early 90s in Vic Reeves’ Big Night Out. His working relationship with Vic has continued for decades and the pair are regarded among the funniest acts in British comedy. Bob is also known for his part in another double act, with Paul Whitehouse in Gone Fishing, a programme which documents their time together on the shores of rivers, streams, seas and lakes as part of Bob’s recovery from open heart surgery. \n\nUpon entering the Dish kitchen, Bob quickly spots the pork pie starter and crisp bowl, which is followed by Angela fulfilling his nostalgic request and serving kedgeree-style monkfish rice alongside a fresh and cold IPA.

        "description": "Bob Mortimer is an English comedian, TV presenter, fisherman, author, podcaster, pork pie detective and 100% certified national treasure. He’s with us to chat about his new book, The Long Shoe, his third work of fiction following the successes of The Hotel Avocado and The Satsuma Complex. Bob has sold over 2 million books (and counting), crowning another significant chapter in his legendary career. \n\nBob first appeared on our screens in the early 90s in Vic Reeves’ Big Night Out. His working relationship with Vic has continued for decades and the pair are regarded among the funniest acts in British comedy. Bob is also known for his part in another double act, with Paul Whitehouse in Gone Fishing, a programme which documents their time together on the shores of rivers, streams, seas and lakes as part of Bob’s recovery from open heart surgery. \n\nUpon entering the Dish kitchen, Bob quickly spots the pork pie starter and crisp bowl, which is followed by Angela fulfilling his nostalgic request and serving kedgeree-style monkfish rice alongside a fresh and cold IPA. Waitrose’s wine experts pair this meal with a glass of Paul Mas Réserve Languedoc Blanc.\n\nFrom stories about accidental house fires to avoiding dinner parties and the perfect pasta name for a cat, we learn an incredible amount in Bob’s company. We also find time to put his love of eggs to the test in an action packed end of show finale.

      "description": "I loved interviewing Richard Osman and can’t stop thinking about our conversation. I think it’s because his brain works at warp speed: I genuinely felt he was three steps ahead of every question I was about to ask. It became something of a personal challenge to ask a question he couldn’t guess beforehand and I *think* I managed it when I asked if he’d ever written to Jim’ll Fix It (he had, by the way).\n\nHis mind was formed by an early passion for television and the stories it created. He became an expert producer of winning formats and then, in his 40s, transferred his skill for knowing what people wanted to books. His debut, The Thursday Murder Club, became the fastest-selling crime novel of all time. The following three in the same series have sold over 10 million copies globally.\n\nHe joins me to talk about professional failure, his lifelong struggle with food addiction and his Fear Of Joining In (FOJI). Plus: cats and why being tall is a successful c**t radar.\n\nRichard’s new novel - We Solve Murders is published on 12 September 2024.\n\nAs always, I’d LOVE to hear about your failures. Every week, my guest and I choose a selection to read out and answer on our special subscription offering, Failing with Friends. We’ll endeavour to give you advice, wisdom, some laughs and much, much more.\n\n\n\nHave something to share of your own? I'd love to hear from you! Click here to get in touch: howtofailpod.com\n\n\n\nProduction & Post Production Manager: Lily Hambly\n\nStudio and Mix Engineer: Josh Gibbs\n\nSenior Producer: Selina Ream\n\nExecutive Producer: Carly Maile\n\nHead of Marketing: Kieran Lancini\n\n\n\nHow to Fail is an Elizabeth Day and Sony Music Entertainment Production.\n\nFind more great podcasts from Sony Music Entertainment at sonymusic.com/podcasts\n\nTo bring your brand to life in this podcast, email podcastadsales@sonymusic.com\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

        "description": "I loved interviewing Richard Osman and can’t stop thinking about our conversation. I think it’s because his brain works at warp speed: I genuinely felt he was three steps ahead of every question I was about to ask. It became something of a personal challenge to ask a question he couldn’t guess beforehand and I *think* I managed it when I asked if he’d ever written to Jim’ll Fix It (he had, by the way).\n\nHis mind was formed by an early passion for television and the stories it created. He became an expert producer of winning formats and then, in his 40s, transferred his skill for knowing what people wanted to books. His debut, The Thursday Murder Club, became the fastest-selling crime novel of all time. The following three in the same series have sold over 10 million copies globally.\n\nHe joins me to talk about professional failure, his lifelong struggle with food addiction and his Fear Of Joining In (FOJI). Plus: cats and why being tall is a successful c**t radar.\n\nRichard’s new novel - We Solve Murders is published on 12 September 2024.\n\nAs always, I’d LOVE to hear about your failures. Every week, my guest and I choose a selection to read out and answer on our special subscription offering, Failing with Friends. We’ll endeavour to give you advice, wisdom, some laughs and much, much more.\n\n\n\nHave something to share of your own? I'd love to hear from you!

His first novel, The Thursday Murder Club, was a publishing phenomenon, selling more than a million copies, and the follow-up became one of the fastest-selling titles since records began.\nRichard grew up in Haywards Heath in West Sussex and his early passion for television led to him devising quiz shows and programme formats from a young age. After graduating from university he worked for a number of production companies where he helped to develop and produce shows including Total Wipeout, Deal or No Deal and 8 out of 10 Cats.  \nIn 2009 Richard became a co-presenter of Pointless alongside Alexander Armstrong. It was not his intention to move in front of the camera, but he was given the job after taking on the role of co-host while the show was being developed. \nIn 2020 Richard published his debut novel, the Thursday Murder Club, the story of four friends in a retirement community who band together to solve cold cases. It was an instant hit, selling 45,000 copies in its first three days on sale.  Steven Spielberg has bought the film rights. \nRichard lives in London and is writing his third novel featuring his resourceful retirees. \nDISC ONE: Bring Me Sunshine by Morecambe And Wise\nDISC TWO: Metal Mickey by Suede\nDISC THREE: Snooker (Drag Racer) by The Douglas Wood Group\nDISC FOUR:  You Can't Stop The Beat by the cast of Hairspray (Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, Amanda Bynes, Elijah Kelly, John Travolta and Queen Latifah)\nDISC FIVE: Extraordinary Machine by Fiona Apple\nDISC SIX: American Boy by Estelle Featuring Kanye West\nDISC SEVEN: Ran by Future Islands\nDISC EIGHT: A Little Respect by Erasure\nBOOK CHOICE:  Hercule Poirot: the Complete Short Stories by Agatha Christie\nLUXURY ITEM: A pad of paper, a pen and dice\nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE: DISC FOUR:  You Can't Stop The Beat by the cast of Hairspray \nPresenter Lauren Laverne\nProducer  Paula McGinley",

        "description": "Richard Osman is a broadcaster, TV producer and writer who co-presents the quiz show Pointless on BBC One. His first novel, The Thursday Murder Club, was a publishing phenomenon, selling more than a million copies, and the follow-up became one of the fastest-selling titles since records began.\nRichard grew up in Haywards Heath in West Sussex and his early passion for television led to him devising quiz shows and programme formats from a young age. After graduating from university he worked for a number of production companies where he helped to develop and produce shows including Total Wipeout, Deal or No Deal and 8 out of 10 Cats.  \nIn 2009 Richard became a co-presenter of Pointless alongside Alexander Armstrong. It was not his intention to move in front of the camera, but he was given the job after taking on the role of co-host while the show was being developed. \nIn 2020 Richard published his debut novel, the Thursday Murder Club, the story of four friends in a retirement community who band together to solve cold cases. It was an instant hit, selling 45,000 copies in its first three days on sale.  Steven Spielberg has bought the film rights. \nRichard lives in London and is writing his third novel featuring his resourceful retirees. \nDISC ONE: Bring Me Sunshine by Morecambe And Wise\nDISC TWO: Metal Mickey by Suede\nDISC THREE: Snooker (Drag Racer) by The Douglas Wood Group\nDISC FOUR:  You Can't Stop The Beat by the cast of Hairspray (Nikki Blonsky, Zac Efron, Amanda Bynes, Elijah Kelly, John Travolta and Queen Latifah)\nDISC FIVE: Extraordinary Machine by Fiona Apple\nDISC SIX: American Boy by Estelle Featuring Kanye West\nDISC SEVEN: Ran by Future Islands\nDISC EIGHT: A Little Respect by Erasure\nBOOK CHOICE:  Hercule Poirot: the Complete Short Stories by Agatha Christie\nLUXURY ITEM: A pad of paper, a pen and dice\nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE: DISC FOUR:  You Can't Stop The Beat by the cast of Hairspray \nPresenter Lauren Laverne\nProducer  Paula McGinley",

      "description": "Bob Mortimer is a comedian best known for his work with his comedy partner Vic Reeves.\nFor 30 years, he and Vic have appeared in numerous TV series together, including Vic Reeves’ Big Night Out, Shooting Stars and The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer. Bob first saw Vic performing in a south London pub: Vic was wearing a Bryan Ferry mask while trying to tap dance with wooden planks strapped to his feet. Bob found this hugely entertaining, and began to take part in Vic’s shows. \nBob was born in 1959 in Middlesbrough, the youngest of four boys. His father died in a car crash when he was seven and Bob says he became his mother’s little helper – although he also set fire to their house after playing with fireworks. As a teenager he dreamed of a career as a footballer, but he ended up studying law at university, and worked as a solicitor in south London. \nIn 2015 Bob underwent triple heart bypass surgery.

        "description": "Bob Mortimer is a comedian best known for his work with his comedy partner Vic Reeves.\nFor 30 years, he and Vic have appeared in numerous TV series together, including Vic Reeves’ Big Night Out, Shooting Stars and The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer. Bob first saw Vic performing in a south London pub: Vic was wearing a Bryan Ferry mask while trying to tap dance with wooden planks strapped to his feet. Bob found this hugely entertaining, and began to take part in Vic’s shows. \nBob was born in 1959 in Middlesbrough, the youngest of four boys. His father died in a car crash when he was seven and Bob says he became his mother’s little helper – although he also set fire to their house after playing with fireworks. As a teenager he dreamed of a career as a footballer, but he ended up studying law at university, and worked as a solicitor in south London. \nIn 2015 Bob underwent triple heart bypass surgery. After this – in a rare diversion from working with Vic – he accepted an invitation from fellow comedian Paul Whitehouse to get out of the house and go fishing, which led to a successful TV series, Mortimer and Whitehouse: Gone Fishing. \nBOOK CHOICE: My Secret History by Paul Theroux\nLUXURY ITEM: His own pillow\nCASTAWAY'S FAVOURITE: Down to You by Joni Mitchell\nPresenter: Lauren Laverne\nProducer: Sarah Taylor",

      "description": "Adam talks with British comedian Bob Mortimer.\nHi. Adam Buxton here with some notes about Bob and this episode.\nFor nearly 30 years Bob and his comedy partner Jim Moir (aka Vic Reeves) have stuck doggedly to what makes them laugh whether mainstream audiences get it or not, with shows like ‘The Smell Of Reeves & Mortimer’, ‘Bang Bang It’s Reeves & Mortimer’, ‘Catterick’, and ‘House Of Fools’ as well as the occasional reboots of the massively popular panel show ‘Shooting Stars’ and the show that introduced them to the world in 1990, ‘Big Night Out’. \nConsistently and inexhaustibly joyful, energetic and absurd, their parade of characters, silly voices, home made props and a sensibility that is often close to avant garde performance art, has made them two of the best loved and most influential comedians the UK has ever produced. \nWhen not working with Jim, Bob enjoys watching football. He’s an avid supporter of Middlesbrough FC and is currently the co host along with comedy writer Andy Dawson of the vaguely football themed podcast, ‘Athletico Mince’. It’s up with the funniest stuff Bob’s ever done.\nMy conversation with Bob, took place in the London office of his agent and for a while we had to battle with some quite loud talkers in the corridor outside doing agent business (I was too weedy to ask them to be quiet), but that calmed down after a little while and we rambled about getting older, the TV shows that Bob enjoys, his new fishing show with old friend and fellow comedian Paul Whitehouse, music, petty crime and now and then we looked back over a few Vic & Bob moments from the last 30 years. \nIt was a fun conversation that often revealed a softer and more gentle side to Bob than people might expect. It’s a good bet that he would feel quite deeply nauseated by that last sentence and perhaps a few before too.\nThanks to Séamus Murphy-Mitchell for production support and Matt Lamont for additional editing.
